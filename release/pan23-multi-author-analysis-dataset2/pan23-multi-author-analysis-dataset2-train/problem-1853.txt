Yeah. I popped by r/conservative last night just to take the temperature, and was surprised to see how many people were saying that Trump was hurting the party and needed to just get lost already.
Yeah, I’m close enough that it would be a relatively easy drive across the border to Charlotte if I ever needed an abortion, which is my plan should that happen. Provided it remains legal there.
They've been that way for awhile I feel when I check in. The reddit Republican community has been Desantis for years.
If he is indicted by the DOJ, he is going to scream fraud and drag the GOP into the fight. The voters just loudly rejected Trumps antics. The GOP will have to find a way to extract themselves from the fray without sending Trump into orbit. This could end up being the rapture the GOP seems to be looking for.
Yes but they have a problem now. Trump appears to have reached the point where his toxicity has overtaken his allure. There is no exit plan that doesn’t involve colossal damage to the GOP. He has the dirt, the fundraising money, and a sizable portion of the base in his corner. They need him to negotiate a graceful exit but he will _never_ do anything that could be construed as defeat. He will burn down everything if they try and force it.
