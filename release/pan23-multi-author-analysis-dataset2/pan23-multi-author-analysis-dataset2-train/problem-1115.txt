I agree with the other posters. This line makes it clear that the landlord is responsible for the appliance:
If the landlord wants, they can rewrite your lease after your current lease expires to exclude this responsibility. You of course would have the option not to sign (and find a new place to live).
We live in Mississippi and the only place the lease mentions appliances is "Lessor also agrees to maintain in safe working order and condition all electrical, plumbing, sanitary,., And appliances supplied or required to be supplied by the lessor".
It is different if there's a washer in the unit that you had use of. It's common tenants leave behind old appliances that wouldn't be supplied.
Their argument is that since it was supplied by the old landlord and not them, it is not their responsibility. But we don't want to fix something if they keep it when we move out.
The lessor is the landlord, they are required to maintain the appliances under this lease. Your lease transfers over to the new owner.
If you are in CA the landlord needs to repair the washer and dryer and other appliances if they were there originally when you signed the lease. Potentially you could repair and deduct after following specific steps.
Mississippi also allows for repair and deduct in specific cases, but you need to give written notice and follow the timeline.
But if you are on a month to month lease they can just end your lease. And they could replace the washing machine with another used(working) one instead of repairing it.
