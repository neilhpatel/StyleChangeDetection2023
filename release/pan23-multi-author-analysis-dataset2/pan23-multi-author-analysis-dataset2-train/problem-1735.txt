IANAL, but it seems like you documented her as the owner on their paperwork? Without conflicting paperwork, they may be legally hers.
Well registering horses is not like the title to a car ... its not proof of ownership it is more like a club. I have the sales recipt but its a matter of whether I gifted them to her or not. And again I don't care if I give her the $50k or even triple damages at $150K its about the principle for me. She will not touch those horses.
I wouldn't do anything to the horses. If they're listed as hers, she could take you to court for $50k worth of horses if you harm or kill them.
Maybe not, but this is the legal advice sub, and you're looking to establish ownership for a better sale. I don't know if you can.
What you've described is not just your word versus hers on who owns the horse. In a court, a judge would take the registration papers into account, along with the fact that she was the primary person who rode them, and that they were bought specifically for her use.
