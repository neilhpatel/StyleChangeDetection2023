Right. I would think that property laws are less black and white when its a sentient being with its own thoughts, feelings, and desires rather than some inanimate object but I guess not. Certainly not morally black and white, only legally apparently.
So why are you asking about the legality of keeping your neighbor's cat if you only care about the morality?
No, the cat belongs to someone else. You know that. So if that someone requests a return of their property either you return it or you enter the zone of stealing.
Legally speaking, pets are property. In court, bringing his cat home and then taking him to the vet is legally the same as if you found his bicycle on the sidewalk and brought it home and then took it to a repair shop to fix it up. You could ask the neighbor to repay you for the vet bills when you give it back, but you would have to give it back.
Your have to give him back. You can't just steal a cat. If you want to keep him and the neighbours don't seem to care then talk to them and offer to purchase the cat from them.
