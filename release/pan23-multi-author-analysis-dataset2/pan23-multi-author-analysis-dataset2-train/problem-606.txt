You are paying money one way or another at this point. At 28+ you can't avoid that. Pay it for lawyer, driving diversion, or final fines but you are paying.
You can do things like driving diversion before going to court to show the court you are doing better and hope they can reduce the charges.
I'd find out what driving diversion programs your area has and sign up for them but that is going to cost money but not as much as if you can't get the charges reduced.
I will I promise lol I guess I just got distracted by my friends and I didn’t even realize I was speeding to be honest I wasn’t intentionally doing 70 I guess I just didn’t realize how fast I was going because I wasn’t looking at my speedometer.
Well the classes are only $100 and I would only have to take them once and I think it’s just a four hour course and on the paper it says if I take the class I will not have to pay for the ticket but I’ll still have to show up to court but either way there’s no way I can afford a lawyer but when I do go to court I do plan on pleading guilty.
