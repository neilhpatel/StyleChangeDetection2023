>Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 19 June the Ukrainian parliament passed two laws which placed restrictions on Russian books and music. The new laws ban Russian citizens from printing books unless they take Ukrainian citizenship, prohibit the import of books printed in Russia, Belarus and the occupied Ukrainian territories, and prohibit the reproduction in the media and public transport of music performed or created by post-1991 Russian citizens, unless the musicians are included in a "white list" of artists who have publicly condemned Russian aggression against Ukraine.[14][15][16].
Yep. The laws around language are pretty typical for most countries. They set a standard for which the government is to operate. The official language of the US is English. There are regional exceptions for Spanish and other languages though. The laws Ukraine passed in 2022 after the Russian invasion are clearly geared at limiting Russians and sending a message to Russia.
For some reason, Russia has built up language to be culturally significant. One of the complaints they have against Ukraine is that Ukraine wants Ukrainian to be the official language of Ukraine. To Russia, this means they HATE Russians and Russia, which they now do, but it did not start with language. Having Western words used in everyday Russian is also an affront to Russian culture. It is crazy, and you are correct, this is not how language works. Unless, you are in to using language as a form of population control, like Russia.
