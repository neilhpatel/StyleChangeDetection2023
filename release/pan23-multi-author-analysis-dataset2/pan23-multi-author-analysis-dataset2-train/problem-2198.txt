Any employee who has been injured at that job enough that they had to miss work or needed medical treatment needs to . The statute of limitations for WC claims in NJ is 2 years, so if the minor you mentioned was injured after May 9th, 2019, she can file a claim and will be compensated for the injury.
Filing a bunch of workers comp claims will cause your employers WC insurance to go up. This is probably the easiest way to demonstrate to them that their policies are bad business decisions.
This does sound unsafe to me, but there doesn’t seem to be anything illegal about it. Anyone who gets injured should immediately file for workers’ compensation. Also, if you do complain about the safety issues, it would probably be a protected complaint under CEPA (the whistleblower law in NJ), meaning your employer is not allowed to retaliate against you for raising safety issues.
The other abuses you describe suggest to me that this business is poorly managed and it's time to look for another job.
The dog daycare near me requires auditions for new clients to insure that they are adequately socialized to get along with other dogs as well as humans. They still have to have "time outs" when things get too rowdy, however. Aggressive dogs and shock collars would simply not be allowed.
