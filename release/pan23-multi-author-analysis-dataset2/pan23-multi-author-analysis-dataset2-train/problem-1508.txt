Talk to your local DMV and see if they have a process for reporting the car sold and bring what proof you have to show what date it sold. Most DMVs have a process for this and it will help you if the storage company has a balance remaining and tries to pursue you for the remainder. Many states have a certain time period in which you are supposed to report the car sold, but most sellers rely on the buyer to transfer the ownership so talk to the DMV and see if there is anything you can do after the fact.
This happened to me with a motorcycle a sold in WA state. Lesson learned always file the sale! My advice: contact the company storing it right away. Explain the situation to them, let them know if that you do not want the vehicle back. What happened for me is the company waived the storage fee not the towing fee and I transferred ownership through my states process for doing so when the title is lost. I was out a few hundred bucks but not the full amount. They selling the vehicle at auction usually so ownership transfer helped them expedite that process.
