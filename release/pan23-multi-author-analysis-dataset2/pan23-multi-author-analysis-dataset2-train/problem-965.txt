I recognize the risk for corruption, but the destruction that public criminal records cause in the lives of the poor outweighs that risk, in my opinion.
We need a public record and a private record when it comes to crime. Once your punishment has been served, the crime should be removed from your public record. However, the private record, obtainable only when a person is on trial for a crime and only by the lawyers and/or judge associated with the trial itself, should contain the full history.
As it is, "serving time" becomes a lifelong thing, as people with criminal records are pretty much screwed for the rest of their lives. That's not how crime and punishment should work.
