From whom, just a person? Equipment sure, but how do you buy a name from a person, is it the trademark, etc.?
The easy answer is don't do this. The more complex answer is that this is something your attorney needs to investigate and then come up with a good strategy for. In general, if you buy only a corporation's assets, you don't assume its liabilities, including taxes. If you buy a corporation's shares of stock, however, you end up with both its assets and liabilities, including known and unknown taxes. An example of an unknown tax debt would be one that resulted from an IRS audit that has not yet begun. The seller of the corporate shares is released from all corporate debts unless he personally guarantees them or agrees to be liable for them after the transfer.
You could very easily be personally liable for the tax issues. And any other debt. But it's really unclear what you're buying other than some equipment. How does he file taxes, under what sort of entity?
