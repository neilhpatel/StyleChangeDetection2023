And yet, Maggie Haberman probably has better access to Trump than any other journalist, except for Hannity. Not that I consider him a journalist, but you get my point.
I recently saw a "Stable Genius" meme where Trump's head replaced the horse's head in a stable. Someone commented that they put the head on the wrong end of the horse.
My grandfather kept a few horses on his farm, and I think he used to tell me I was a stable genius when I was 10 years old to get me to shovel the horseshit out of the stalls. My apologies for the crudeness, but every time I hear the phrase stable genius, that's where my mind goes, amazing how certain sights, sounds and particularly smells will stick with you.
My dad is a severe narc just like trump, to the extent that i cannot bear too watch trump speak because his body language is literally the same down too his head tilts when he feels he is making an amazing point or saying something impressive.
