I cover this in part two of the answer. The eldest of the Coterel brothers - John - inherited his father's manor of Ashby-Foleville and lived a life of "comfortable respectability" (to quote myself). You are remembering how inheritance worked correctly, and it does appear to have played a part in the formation of at least one medieval gang.
I don’t know if this comment will be removed for its brevity, but I skimmed your answer there, so if you addressed the following point and I missed it, I’m sorry—but I wonder if primogeniture inheritance played a role in these highwaymen coming from affluent backgrounds but resorting to banditry anyway? I don’t remember how inheritances were passed on in England or Europe generally at this time but I think it went to the firstborn, right?
I looked those places up and Tadinon looks like it's quite a distance from Cromford and Matlock (nearly six hours of walking according to Google). Was it common, or at least common enough to be unremarkable, for someone to own such far-apart places? Would 5 hours of walking even be considered far apart in 14th century England?
