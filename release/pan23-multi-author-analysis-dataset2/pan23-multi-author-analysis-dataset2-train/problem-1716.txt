Generally yes, but, the steps will vary by location. In most states, you have to give the landlord notice of bed bugs and allow them reasonable time to cure the infestation. Reasonable time will vary by location. You may want to add more detailed info to your question and give the timeframe for everything that has occurred up until this point, in order to get accurate information. (Date of onset, date of notice of bed bugs to landlord, when treatments started, location).
Practical advice - bugs have a life cycle and exterminators work within that. Some things kill adults, some nymphs, not many eggs. So old eggs may hatch, walk around, get exposed, then die.
As far as breaking your lease, your best bet would be to ask if you could move. They will likely say no. Then you have to determine if their efforts to remove are enough - in my state they likely would be. Getting rid of bugs can take time and money, multiple treatments.
Many leases make this the responsibility of the tenant, although that needs to be considered along with reasonableness. Have you lived there long? Is it a multi family? Does anyone else in the building have them? Could they assume you brought them?
