Oh look, a hit piece written by an oil industry shill married to a railroad industry magnate. How very 1925 of The Hill to give her a platform. Inflation kicked into gear well before the Democratic / Biden initiatives passed. And inflation is now slowing.
I haven’t seen one of the folks whining that Biden “broke” gas prices last year also say that Biden “fixed” gas prices when they went down.
And that 3.8 trillion was to help stop the disaster of Lord Dampnut's handling of COVID, and the COVID recovery that helped to cause inflation in the first place.
No covid and its lasting effects are to blame for inflation along with the war in Ukraine. Biden's infrastructure bill is estimated to create upwards of 2 million jobs a year over the next decade.
The deficit was down by $1.4 trillion in 2022, and for 2023 won't be any higher than it was in 2019.
Plus, it is congress which has the power of the purse. A president can only ever spend what congress authorizes, and once he signs those bills, has no option to not spend what was authorized. He has a constitutional obligation to faithfully execute those laws.
