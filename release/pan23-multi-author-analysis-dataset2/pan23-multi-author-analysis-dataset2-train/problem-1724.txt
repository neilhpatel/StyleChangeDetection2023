As someone familiar with taxes, this doesn’t surprise me, as Puerto Rico is very different from the 50 states. For example, if you work as an employee in CA, WA, PA, etc you get a W-2. If you work in PR, you get a W-2PR. The location you complete the work is where the tax law applies, so it makes sense that they do not want an employee to work in PR if they aren’t set up for PR. Can you become an independent contractor? That all depends on the nature and rules set up, which would most likely have to change for you to do so. Also you’d be responsible for the PR tax laws as self employed.
The crux of the issue is that every state or territory has its own tax and employment laws, moving to another state / territory would put the burden on your payroll / hr department to figure out how to handle you're employment in that new location.
Even though your company is mainly based out of the UK, it sounds like you're being paid by a business entity out of California.
Regardless of how temporary you may feel this is, the fact of the matter is that you are changing your address.
You can be a California employee and CA resident temporarily relocating to PR(or almost anywhere), the company doesn't need to do anything different. You will still be a CA resident, paying CA taxes. You would not be an independent contractor. Relocating to another place temporarily for 3-6 months doesn't mean you become a resident for tax purposes.
If you move to PR permanently the company is doing business in PR, needs to register there and comply with local law. Even if the law is mostly similar, or less strict than CA there is a cost associated and the business. PR has some significant differences and this isn't trivial. They could fire you instead of incurring that cost. Or change the scope of your work so you are an independent contractor and not an employee, potentially by requiring that you incorporate.
