RSV seems to be downplayed in the news probably because most people don't need to be hospitalized, but it can kick your ass.
I'm just getting over RSV that I contracted on Thanksgiving. My ribs feel like they're broken from all the coughing I was doing.
Did you get a fever? My wife and I are going through something pretty mean right now 102 F. And I had my Covid and flu shots. Whatever we have isn’t messing around.
I think I had RSV. Very slight fever that lasted maybe 6 hours, but 2 weeks of unproductive coughing. There were 3 days in the middle where there was mucus in my chest. Symptoms showed up on Thanksgiving. Today is the first day that I haven’t needed to take medication to address symptoms. Tested negative for COVID.
Yeah fever and sweats. The night sweats were incredible. I was soaked with sweat several times during one night. I felt like crap for about a week and I'm just now at the point where I'm not coughing up phlegm every few minutes. This virus kicked our butts.
