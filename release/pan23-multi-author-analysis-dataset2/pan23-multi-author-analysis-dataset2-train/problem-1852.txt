Medical professional here. This doctor didn't follow the written documentation that you left with the office as to what is appropriate for leaving messages. See if the office or his doctor group has a compliance officer. File a complaint with them or with the office manager.
You clearly stated to that said professional to not leave voicemails to the attached number. He disregarded your wishes and followed through to his own actions. He violated your confidentiality. Whether it was an accidental forget moment or ignorance, he still violated your privacy.
Bring it up with management of his workplace and outline your worries, what happened, and what it caused, including your emotional report.
It's a huge violation, but unfortunately HIPAA includes no private right to action, so the most you can do is report them and they might get fined or scolded, but OP won't receive any damages.
I am an MD and agree this is a huge violation. Contact the medical practice first to complain but you can take this further if you want. We all know in the medical field that regardless of the law, discretion and confidentiality come first when speaking with anyone but the patient directly . I would only ever leave a message for the patient to “please call Dr ......at this number”. My husband is a psychiatrist and he has to be even more discreet when leaving his name and number on a family/business vm as it is easy to look him up and not everyone wants others to know they are seeing a psychiatrist for various reasons. It is very important to protect the patients privacy and never discuss any medical condition unless you are speaking directly to the patient. I’m sorry this happened to you, it is wrong and careless and I’m sure it has caused you a great deal of stress.
