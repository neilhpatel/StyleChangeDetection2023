Who’s definition of “safe” online activities are we using? One parent’s who cares is another parent’s OMG. Very subjective. Maybe making it opt in by choice could help the more paranoid parents be in control, though kids can be more technically savvy than their parents so it may not matter. Putting the responsibility to websites is a bad idea. Maybe possibly creating a .kids TLD that allow the sites choose to create a kids site. Restrict to .kids. Still, so much educational/life broadening content access could be lost because of paranoia about what is kid friendly. It’s going to dumb down kids more.
I keep saying it but I will say it again. This kind of stuff is supposed to be the parents responsibility, not the government. Plus it would be impossible to implement verification to meet the very vague standards set in this bill. And how will websites know what constitutes being an 18+? Sure it's easy if it's a porn site, but what of actual artistic sites that depict nudity for instance?
I remember in a middle school field trip to an art museum, there was one painting that had partial nudity in it. And one of the chaperones freaked out over it and basically blindfolded her kid through the rest of the tour to 'protect his innocence', then raised a fuss over how the school was trying to corrupt the children. Funny story, he was the kid who got into his dad's Playboy collection and would sneak them into school.
