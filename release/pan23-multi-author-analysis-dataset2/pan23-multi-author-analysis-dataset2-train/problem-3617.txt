Absolute BS. There is no restriction and no advised by the CDC or WHO about sending mail during Covid. Sending mail transferred Covid Amazon would have been a super spreader.
In fact you can disprove his claim by sending a formal request for proof of debt. Thay have to send that proof. Once received you can request the settlement offer in writing.
My opinion, educated guess, is that they want a payment in order to show you agreed to pay the full amount. Whatever you do don’t agree to pay via a settlement without it in writing.
He made an offer to settle the debt to the collection agency, on what was most definitely a recorded phone conversation. By doing so he already admitted to the debt and can still be sued for the full balance. You have to be very careful how you word your conversations with collection agencies. For a measly couple hundred dollars I would offer to pay the whole debt, but it has to be removed from his credit report. Of course get it in writing first. $200 is not worth bad credit. It's a quality of life issue. Credit score effects job prospects, ability to buy or rent a home, loan availability, interest rates and cost of insurance.
It only effects your credit if that’s the only $200 on there. If your already $10k in debt and just trying to keep this one bill from garnishment it isn’t going to do you any good to pay the whole amount.
In many states, any debt can be garnished, usually as long as it is a court judgment. The bigger question is how much can they garnish, and that answer will likely surprise you too: up to 25% of your wages.
