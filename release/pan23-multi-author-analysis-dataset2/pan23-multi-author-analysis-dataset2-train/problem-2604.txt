I know of no polls or studies that have determined that Trumps base was significantly reduced from dying from Covid.

Frankly even though a little over a million total died and since March the number was higher for Republicans for the sake of that persons argument I do not think Trumps percentage could have been that significantly impacted. It’s still probably stayed at about 30%. Hell, he even got more votes that November than he did the first election. Even if the entire million were allTrumps supporters his percentage could not have gone down to may points I don’t think.
I do not understand how any regular individual thinks voting for trump is a good idea. The man is clearly a criminal.
