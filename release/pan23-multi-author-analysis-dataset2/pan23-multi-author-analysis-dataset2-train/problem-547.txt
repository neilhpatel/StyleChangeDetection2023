What's cool is using biotechnology you can make just the protein and not need to use animals to do it. As someone who also worked with food it really is amazing how much science and wisdom is involved in that field.
First we need to stop putting more plastic in the ocean, then we need to remove the macro plastics that are floating on the surface. I don't think it's realistic to remove the existing micro plastics. Maybe a giant meteor will vaporize the oceans and fuse the micro plastics into the rocks, and then the next round of life will be able to enjoy micro plastic-free oceans.
The ocean has 352 quintillion gallons of water. Filtering it seems like a fools errand. Converting egg whites into this filter material requires heating it up to 900C in a vacuum. This isn't an energy efficient solution, and it's using a food source that requires resources to produce.
All ya got to do is make the protein we don't need chicken farms for that. This can be manufactured at scale without interfering with the food supply.
