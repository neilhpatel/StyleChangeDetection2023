Who holds the authority to grant waivers for sovereign immunity? If instead of suing the Supreme Court, I were to sue the US federal government, could I petition the sitting President to provide a waiver on behalf of the federal government?
State and federal governments cannot be sued. You also can't sue the president or governors or any elected official or the Supreme Court for official actions. If you are harmed by the Texas statute then you can sue an official in charge of enforcing that statute based on that. But unless the statute has harmed you, you don't have standing for a lawsuit.
Cannot be sued without their consent.\ I'm just trying to understand how the government waives sovereign immunity. Do I just get a note that says, it's okay to sue me from any john doe working for the federal government?
You are reading a google caption on the doctrine in general. In practice you CANNOT sue the government, only officials related to enforcing a statute which has violated your rights. Besides, why in the world would the government consent to being sued by you? They gain nothing and spend money in court.
