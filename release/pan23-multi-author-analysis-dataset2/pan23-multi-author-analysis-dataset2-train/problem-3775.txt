Strangely, it's come out in NZ that the baby has already had a blood transfusion as part of an earlier treatment and the parents gave consent for that????
I'm so sorry that you had to bury your son. I had a friend die some years back and watching how difficult it was for his parents changed my entire life view. I hope that you are at least ok and I totally agree with you, these people should lose custody of their kid.
150 protesters supporting the parents in calling for the DEATH OF A BABY Because without the surgery or blood to support it, the BABY WILL DIE.
Speaking to the court, Paul White, the lawyer representing Te Whatu Ora, said the parents’ strong opposition to the transfusion was “curious” given that the child had already been given blood as part of earlier treatment, which the mother had consented to.
SO you rather have your child die than have blood that a person donated that may or may not contain vaccinated blood. So you are willing to let your child die because of your unfonded beliefs....WTF is wrong with you You really prefer this to make a point????
