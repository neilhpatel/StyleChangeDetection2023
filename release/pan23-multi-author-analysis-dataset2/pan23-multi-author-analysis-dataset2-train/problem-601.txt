That's what they say, but if 50% casualties ever actually happened in reality there would be generals getting hauled in front of Congress and very likely "retired" so fast our heads would spin.
One of the problems in Fallujah was combatants being dressed similarly to civilians. RoE still had to be followed during the battle, and a lot of effort was put into avoiding shooting non combatants (one could argue more effort could have been put in). I think that will be less of an issue in Kherson, but I feel like the Russians are more likely to use human shields.
Al-Qaeda and the IAI also had experience in urban warfare and setting up ambushes / kill zones. Russia is going to be lacking that type of experience.
Just the process of opening a door is complex and tedious. Not getting sucked into the first target you see requires live fire practice and training. You have to stay connected to your rifle/sights the whole time.
Seems like most have plates at this point. I've seen a drastic reduction in requests for armor donations since the start of the war. Also reports of Russians complaining that Ukrainian's don't die when shot.
Games to real life...just remember russia out numbers ukraine over all. It only takes a rat with a mosin in a corner watching the door to trade a 1 for 1 to make this bad for ukraine. Personally if the infastructure of the town is beyond repair I'd consider just leveling it 1st.
