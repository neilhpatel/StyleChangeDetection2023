The agent that called said she would send me mail and email, I should probably just wait for the paper document to arrive in my mail first before doing anything...
Now that I have my own house, I won't be moving to an apartment anytime soon so this doesn't bother me as much.
It would be my guess that this isn't an actual "collection agency" in the sense that it was sent to collections. This is more so probably the billing company they are using. I've dealt with this before myself. Call them up, double check they aren't reporting it to the credit companies and either pay it or make arraignments.
You have not stated any specific law that would prohibit a creditor from selling a debt immediately. "Credit Reporting and Collection laws" is not an answer. A collection agency can purchase current debts just as easily as they can purchase delinquent ones. The only difference is that, of course, a current debt cannot be reported as delinquent.
Again, what law would that be? A debt cannot be reported as delinquent if it is not, but that is very different from selling a receivable, or outsourcing collection to another company. (Both of those are utterly-routine business transactions.).
I already stated it in this post, go read it. Collections is typically referred to for debt collectors who purchase delinquent debts. While yes, there are some who also do it as more of a billing department- which it seems this is more likely.
