That's not really how family court works. Your spouse may have been able to get to that eventually, but it is nothing like an automatic outcome.
One guesses in these 10 years your divorce has been dismissed and you'll need to refile. But certainly you might consult a lawyer or check with the court and either advance the pending case or refile.
I have an active status on the case and the last items is the documents were rejected and sent back to her based on spousal support wasn't submitted but we didn't have any for each other.
To be very clear, the only thing the court did wrong here was not dismissing this case a long time ago. The failure to finalize it is on you and your ex for not completing the paperwork properly, not seeking help, and not following through.
Every county in CA has a family law facilitator. Make an appointment with their office and go try to sort this out.
Understandable it being our fault. So the facilitator should be able to see me on this case and help because it really seems like the paperwork only has one mistake on it and got rejected.
