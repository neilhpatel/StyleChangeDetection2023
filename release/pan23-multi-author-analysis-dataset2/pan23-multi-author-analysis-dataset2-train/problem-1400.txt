I would notify the city you used to live in and (if you want) request to file harassment charges for the false reports. This will hopefully give them the heads up that any report they receive will likely be fraudulent.
I would also suggest you contact the city you are in now, and notify them of what's going on and that you are ok and left of your own free will. Provide them with your contact information in case there is an emergency and they do need to easily contact you.
If you no longer want to speak with your parents, make that clear to the police. They may be able to stop it at the front end by basically saying "he's an adult, he's ok, stop calling".
I don’t really know what the police are talking about saying that you left unwillingly. If you are 18, then you are an adult and have the right to leave (unless you are under some sort of conservatorship, etc.) Don’t tell them where you are now- there’s not much they can do and surely the FBI is not going to involve themselves in this.
The police are saying that this is what the parents told them. Parents called the cops and basically said “our son was taken away from us against his will” so the police investigated. Once they contacted OP and cleared it up, the cops informed OP of what the parents reported.
And worst case, the FBI is going to contact OP once, ask him if he's ok, and then tell the parents to go away if they continue to report him as missing/kidnapped.
