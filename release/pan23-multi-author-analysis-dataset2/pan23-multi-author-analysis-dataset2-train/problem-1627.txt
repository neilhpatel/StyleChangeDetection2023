As someone born in Russia, let me just tell you, that the visibility part should worry Americans. When I ended up studying political science in UNC my parents told me "eh all politicians are the same Russian, American, doesn't matter" They were of course right, to a point. American politicians certainly lie and are deceitful. But they had to at least pretend to be good and virtuous. If they lost that image, they fall out of favor and are quickly removed. Even a minor scandal could end a political career. And that was the difference compared to Russian politics. Russian politicians straight up did not give a fuck. You couldn't touch them anyways. You could have an entire novel of evidence of their corruption. No one cared. If anything you'd be the one in danger.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
