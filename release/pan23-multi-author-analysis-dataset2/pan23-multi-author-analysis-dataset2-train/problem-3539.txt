North America in fact had Pre-Columbian urban sites, notably Cahokia, not too far from modern-day St. Louis.
Also worth noting are the Pre-Columbian settlements in the modern-day American Southwest, notably Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde. u/bix783 the history of the cultures behind those settlements.
Finally via u/Reedstilt in another , while it varied quite a bit from people to people and region to region, overall it's erroneous to think of pre-Columbian North Americans as nomadic - much of what is now eastern North America and the Southwest engaged in agriculture.
In addition to Cahokia, which is definitely the most famous of the major Pre-columbian cities north-of-Mexico, I'd like to point out a few more so people don't think it's the only one. In , I have a broad overview. There are also historic Native cities like Etzanoa in Kansas (population 12,000 - 20,000) and Ivitachuco (population 30,000) in Florida, both of which were encountered by the Spanish. Etzanoa was recently rediscovered in 2017, but we're still looking for the exact site of Ivitachuco, somewhere in the vicinity of modern-day Tallahassee.
