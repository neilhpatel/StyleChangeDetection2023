She did not. She followed what everything the guy told her. Going to pt doing every test he said. I told her we got to get away from him but I think she rally believed nobody else would want to work on her. Everytime we left his office we were so disappointed,no answers no hope. She is a court reporter and he suggested one time that maybe he could buy her a specialized chair to support her neck so she could work. Crazy. He told her at an appointment in august he could see the pain she’s in to comeback in 6 months because after 2 years he’ll definitely know if it was a failed fusion. That’s when she had enough and he recommended the test of all test spec scan. He barely looked at that thing and the c 5 c6 was lit up red and glowing. I can’t believe that all that she’s been through and the medical bills piled up,that he’s not responsible for anything. He also recommended back in March that she apply for disability and he’ll do anything he can to help. She did and we still haven’t heard back from that. She checks it and her case has been stuck at 90% complete for months. Sorry very frustrating.
Medical malpractice is very fact specific. Consults with a medical malpractice attorney are generally free. Take the record and see if they think there is a case.
