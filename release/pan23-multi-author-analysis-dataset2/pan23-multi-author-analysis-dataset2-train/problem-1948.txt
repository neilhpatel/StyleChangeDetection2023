I work in property management. This is 100% a scam. I've heard it being done, mostly by small owners or very shady management companies in poorer areas. I'd advise OP to read their lease carefully, take copies and scan the lease as well. A land lord that attempts something like this will surely try to do other things. E.g. Sudden rent changes, utility bills, repairs, or lock changes. That said, in most cities/states items "left behind" by the previous tenants or owner are generally considered abandon after 30 days unless they've made contact about picking up or having the item returned at a later date. If the landlord does try to take you to small claims reach out to your local tenancy advocacy group. They may offer to help you or can provide you resources for the claims court.
Yeah but having a video walk thru that shows the days paper AND emailed photos to yourself on that date AND EXIF data is far more proof than any small claims judge would require.
When your lease expires, take pictures of every room, appliance, carpet, everything. You will need these to get your security deposit back.
