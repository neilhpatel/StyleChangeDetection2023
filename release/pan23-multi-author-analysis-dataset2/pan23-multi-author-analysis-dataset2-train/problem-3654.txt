Just being drunk doesn't necessarily mean you can't consent to sexual acts. Do you have reason to believe you were drunk to the point of being incapable of consenting or withdrawing consent here?
According to all my friends I was extremely drunk. I needed help going to the toilet. I know I had more than 7 standard drinks in a few hours since I drank a whole bottle of wine and whatever was put in my cup when I was playing beer pong.
No one knows what will happen and you should tell the police everything you know as truthfully as you can. From there it may or may not proceed how you expect it to but that's largely out of your control.
If you truly feel like you didn't consent, or were incapable of consenting, then report it to the police if you choose to. They may or may not believe you, and the investigative process may feel intrusive and annoying.
