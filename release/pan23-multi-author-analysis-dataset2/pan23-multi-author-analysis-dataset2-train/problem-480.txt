When I was a waiter, I had this coworker who always made sure the drawer was even—if it was over, she’d pocket the cash, if she was under, she’d pay it out of her tips. The owner suspected her of shadiness because he’d found some missing receipts that showed her drawer should have been off, so he put an extra $13 in the drawer one night, and when it was even the next day, he fired her. I was only 17 at the time, and the above scheme you describe had never occurred to me until now, and the funny part is I’m a manager and know our policy is 100% to counsel and eventually fire our front desk employees when they’re under or over because mishandling cash is mishandling cash, or so I’d thought. Totally laughing at myself right now—I’m still so naïve!

Probably why he keeps posting half decade old videos (or more) of the 2016 campaign (and other dubious “high points” of Trumpism) before the media realized Trump doesn’t deserve the benefit of the doubt.
