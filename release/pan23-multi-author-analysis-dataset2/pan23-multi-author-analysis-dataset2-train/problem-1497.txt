It will be an absolute game changer for wildlife conservation in the US. It includes permanent funding for non-game wildlife conservation at the state level, by fully funding and implementing the State Wildlife Action Plans. The Dingell-Johnson and Pittman-Robertson Acts already fund state fish and game programs through an excise tax on fishing and hunting gear. This would fund programs for all of the other critters that we don't want to keep around just to harvest. It will also add funding for to restore population of rare plant species, which has been missing from the State Wildlife Action Plan funding thus far.
There's also a strong push to pass the bipartisan Recovering America's Wildlife Act, which passed the House in June and just received a favorable budget score. It could pass as a standalone bill or tied to one of the omnibus spending bills.
