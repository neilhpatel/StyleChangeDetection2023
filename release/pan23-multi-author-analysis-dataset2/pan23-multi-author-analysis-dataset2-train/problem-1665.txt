Whatabout the urban/rural divide within states? Will rural populations side with out of state fascists and try to become enforcers? Like MN has a Democratic gov, senate, and house, but there are deep red pockets scattered all over the state. They'd welcome a takeover--they'd see it as liberation.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

The best case scenario at this point is that forever red states will be content with their power and leave blue states alone. We'll just continue being functionally 2+ separate countries uneasily existing side by side.
I wonder how many of the freedoms and just norms we've gotten used to in blue states/cities will be taken away. The 2020s and 2030s are going to suck so hard.
