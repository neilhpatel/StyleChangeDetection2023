>On Wednesday, it also became known that Tesla had to shut down a storage area for waste on its premises. Previously, there had been a fire there. The authorities were aware that the fire alarm system and the sprinklers were not in operation, said the construction and environmental department of the responsible district Oder-Spree, Sascha Gehm, on Thursday. Previously, the "MÃ¤rkische Oderzeitung" had reported. Tesla is therefore working on the basis of a preliminary fire protection concept that has been approved by the authorities, Gehm said. Around the clock, eight employees are on duty as fire watch and for patrols in the factory, he said. In addition, he said, fire engines are stationed at three locations in the hall.
