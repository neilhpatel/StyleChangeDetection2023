I am older millennial age and I am so completely done with Republicans. I had a Republican raging at me for voting straight ticket blue, because apparently that's as bad as being in the republican death cult they've got going. No capacity to see that then taking away my rights as a person with a functioning uterus sealed that deal for good, that I wasn't just choosing my team. They did that for me by attacking me. Screw them and anyone who supports any of their backward policy.
