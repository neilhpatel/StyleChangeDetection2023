It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
What is your location? Why didn't you pay rent on July 1st? I just don't get it. Was the process for paying rent somehow different than every time you paid rent previously? Is $500 greater than the amount of rent you actually owed?
This is confusing, a "reletting fee" is a assessed when your landlord has to find someone else to occupy your unit because you have or would like to break your lease prematurely. What you're describing is not a reletting fee.
Per your explanation, your landlord is really using the wrong term here. It's also unclear how they calculated the $256 on top of what you originally owed. Just where did that number come from? Is $500 the amount of a full month's rent?
My lease wasn’t broken prematurely. My rent was to be paid online every first of the month. However, I was advised in writing that my last month would be different because I had only stayed five days in July. The leasing office advised that I must reach out to them at the end of June for an individual invoice because their system won’t automatically generate this. The rent that is actually due is $244. I received the invoice in the mail last week. The landlord is calling this a “reletting fee”.
You can decline to pay the excess and present your argument in court if you are sued. It may be difficult for you to establish that you were specifically instructed not to render payment as usual, especially if this instruction was not provided in writing.
