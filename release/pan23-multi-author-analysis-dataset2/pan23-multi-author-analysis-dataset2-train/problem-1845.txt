There's damage to the property, mainly things we were reporting to her that were never fixed. She was charging 8 grand for a broken ceiling tile in the shower (the busted pipe causing the wear on the tile was there for at least a year), ripped carpet (she stated that it was poorly installed when he got the place but said it would be fixed by time of move-in) a hole in the ceiling and the wall (bf's fault) and a stain on the carpet. She also stated it was for rent overdue and that we never made any attempt to pay her(we have phone records trying to pay her and she refused and threatened to block us). His lease had expired and the apartment owner had changed (she had informed him of this in writing) but still remained under the same company. No new lease was established.
Look, you can get a new lawyer, but I don't see why you are so upset about the lawyer wanting your BF to drop the FHA complaint. Dropping the FHA complaint costs you nothing, but gains you a settlement on the 8+ grand she is trying to get out of him.
The "shady" lawyer has presented your BF with a settlement offer. If your BF does not agree to the settlement offer (which includes his dropping the FHA complaint) she can sue him for the 8K she claims he owes her.
We agreed to drop his part of the complaint (reconcilliation) but she also demands that we tell the State to drop the fines.
Edit: We also have no idea what the State will do, and we have no control over what it decides if DE pursues her for violating FHA. She'll essentially punish us for the State's decision.
