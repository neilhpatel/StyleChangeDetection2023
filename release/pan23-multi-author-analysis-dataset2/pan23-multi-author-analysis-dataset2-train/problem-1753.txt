Anything with a beneficiary should not pass through probate. Often the executor will arrange that (if it's an inherited IRA for example). The executor can resign, or be replaced by a court.
If I need to take all the proper steps but the executer is not willing to complete the job, is he/she able to transfer the role of executer?
So follow up.. if an account's beneficiary is clearly listed and agrees with the Will. Is there a need for probate?
You can always apply for the executor job yourself. Normally, the person named in the will has priority, but if you have a really good reason why he shouldn't, or the named person declines to serve, then maybe you can get the job.
If you are listed on the accounts as pay-on-death (or transfer on death) beneficiary, then it doesn't matter what the will says. The beneficiary form overrides the will (\).
