Can you explain how this wouldnt be defamation of character for me or my sister? She is still telling people that She violently sexually assulted me. And if I cant do anyrhing here is there anything I can do?
So now we’re past that. Now we want to learn where the $850 is in this case of yours. Albert can show a bill from the repair shop as evidence that the repair was actually $850.
When Albert sues Bertram, he’s asking the court to step in because Bertram has wronged him in some way, and he wants Bertram to make him whole, to pay him for the damages.
A person can’t generally sue to vindicate someone else’s rights. They can only sue to vindicate their own. From your description, the cousin lied about the sister— while you were named in the story, it wasn’t in a defamatory way; you weren’t accused of doing something wrong.
Your sister is the one who is being defamed, so only she can sue. But now we must confront the next part of the lawsuit puzzle: damages.
“Bertram hit my car because he ran a red light, and it cost me $850 to fix the damaged bumper. Bertram must pay me that $850.” And if the court agrees that Bertram ran the red light, and that this negligence caused Albert’s $850 damage, then Bertram will be ordered to pay.
That’s why I said you can’t sue, any more than Caroline, Albert’s sister, could sue Bertram because she was angry that Bertram was getting away with running a red light. She might be angry, but she wasn’t damaged.
