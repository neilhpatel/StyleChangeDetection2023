What is worse, there is no way to treat it for good. I am visiting the only psychodispancer in my city for year, and they can't even diagnose me, each doctor gives his own "syndrom", some of those i can't even google, and try to be as vague as possible. They prescribe a single antidepressant and if it does not work, say that nothing else can be done. Offered a psychotherapy, and the only therapist in the entire hospital speaks about phases of the moon, astral energies, and suggested a woman to go to church and apologize before the god for putting god bellow her.
People in Europe would walk on pilgrimages as a kind of religious offering, Now science thinks that the walking helps with trauma. If you are a guy, go easy on yourself when doing yoga. I noticed in a yoga class that the women were more flexible, while the man was 'ripped', quite strong, and found it hard to bend himself into the yoga asanas.
I have been to classes where they encourage students to learn the cross legged Lotus posture, but one Asian tradition teacher told me.
set aside brief periods during the day to practice the long, slow breathing, even if you are physically disabled.
I can't do physical efford due to disability. Also my problems were not caused by the war (they only worsened because of it), it's not something that can be treated with walking.
COVID has affected people in USA deeply. Look how many refuse to get vaccinated or keep up with boosters. I suspect this is what a psychologist might call " being in denial" (I am not a mental health professional). When I was younger I met a European woman who had been a teen during World War 2 and she said that obviously insane.
