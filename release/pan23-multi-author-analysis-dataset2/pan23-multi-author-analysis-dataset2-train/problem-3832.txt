Would the people that formerly held your position (and were currently in training) have been allowed to apply for the Level 3 position?
Your employer can treat you the same as other employees when unrelated things like restructuring, layoffs, etc occur. If every other person on your team was shifted onto the team, then they can do the same to you.
If they had just immediately shunted you into this new position (with various allowances for additional training time, etc) that would be a non-issue.
Them allowing you to keep your position temporarily and then ripping that away is what adds a potential layer of complication.
Thank you for your insight on my situation. It sounds as if them keeping me around without moving me for these first few weeks, could be a bigger issue for them than the move itself. That gives me some minor hope.
You aren't wrong, but it's less of a not wanting to and more of a being unable to situation. I worked with our phone team for the first two and a half years of employment with my company. It had negative impacts on my physical and metal health. Being promoted to the job I hold/held currently was very fortunate and directly suits my needs without affecting me the way the prior role did. I'm also damn good at it.
