While this is true you shouldn't leave the context out. They way you have phrased it impales that the majority are closer to 10 then to 18 when it is the other way around. It should also be noted that most, if not all, are done in "devout religious" rural areas controlled religious groups like the Church of the Latter Day Saints/Mormons or Pennsylvania Dutch/Mennonites. While there is a problem with any child marriage happening, it is much more a problem with religious entities being able to circumnavigate the law mostly due to lack of oversight in communes/cults. The biggest issue is that the United States could pass as many laws as they want if they're not enforced by the local law enforcement or there is no local law enforcement then doesn't matter. We have to find a way to actually persecute the people that are at fault. It should be noted that on paper that "marriageable age" is 18 for the majority with only 22 places being 16-17 and that is included places like American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the other residential territories. So again, on paper the US is better then most. But we can and should do better still.
This is a great opportunity to bring up the fact that in 8 US states there is no lower limit for "consent".
