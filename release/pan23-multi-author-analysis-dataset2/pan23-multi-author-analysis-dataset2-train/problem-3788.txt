McConnel and those other Senators and Representatives in the House were simply much more concerned about their own self interest and not one bit about their country. They are greedy, cowardly, and more importantly not patriots when our Country needed them the most. The lot of them should be kicked out and some of which probably deserve to be thrown in jail for conspiring with Trump.
If Trump wins the nomination again, McConnell will fall in line. His personal power in the Senate is more important than the country he's supposed to serve.
That was more than evident when he failed to vote and lead an effort to convict Trump after Jan6 impeachment. We all saw it before then but it doesnâ€™t get much worse when your talking about an insurrection.
