If that is how you want to do things, that's up to you. My only caution would be to refrain from saying "if you kick my mom out, I'm going to the police" as that opens up the possibility that he will say you're extorting him.
If they are married he cannot just kick her out of the marital home. The divorce and his crimes are separate. If you want to file a police report, you should. If you do not, your mother shouldn't be using it as leverage in a civil matter.
She isn’t using that as leverage, a bit disappointing you’d even say that. I asked because it’s something I’ve been needing to do and this is the main reason she’s divorcing him. No on even knows about it but us as of now.
I apologize for misreading and I was not trying to speak ill of your mother. I meant that you, as the victim, should decide how you want to handle reporting the crimes to the police and that you should retain your agency in the matter.
I plan on taking him to court once the divorce is finalized. I have not interfered and my mom and I are on the same page about it. Thanks for you advice.
