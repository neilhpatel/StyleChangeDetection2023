There's simply too much spillover of church into state, "making right with God" in regards to their involvement in the insurrection against all the people in America, and our democracy, should not act as a reason to go with a suspended sentence. We've seen several of these guys plead "remorsefully" then jump back on Fox News after and take it all back.

Garland is simply too mild and "cautious" to be a prosecutor. Whatever he thinks he's doing, one thing's for sure: that there's a wide disparity between race and PoC. How does a white man participating in a violent insurrection get a misdemeanor and sentence smaller than a black man running off with items from Walmart?
