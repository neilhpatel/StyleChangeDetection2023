If you are both on the lease, both of you have the same right to access the unit. Neither of you has the right to deny access to the other, but the law is rather toothless in regards to what remedy you have. Any dispute where she locks you out or you lock her out are civil disputes over adjustments to who pays what share of the rent for the month due to one roommate denying use to the other. It isn't something the police can help with or something that she could be criminally charged with.
I suspect, however, you knowing this fact does not make a difference whatsoever in the tenability of the arrangement long-term. What do you see a best-case scenario outcome being here?
She can't kick you out, what you're asking is if she can terminate your tenancy, and then you'd have to leave. In most places: yes. In Oregon: maybe. How long have you lived there, first of all.
But technically I’m not a tenant right because I’m not on the lease? I’ve been living here for only a month and I do have a key but there’s a chain lock I’ve had to unscrew... What’s the process of terminating tenancy?
She gives you a 30-day written "notice to vacate" and then after 30 days your tenancy is terminated. If you're not out by that date, she takes you to court to get a sheriff to have you removed. You do NOT want it to get that far.
Thank you for the advise. So basically because I’ve been here a month she can boot me whenever she wants? Even after paying rent?
