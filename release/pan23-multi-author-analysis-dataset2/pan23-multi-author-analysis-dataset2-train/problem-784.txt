Thank you. I have the name of the case but not the number. It ended with life without mercy and I think two appeals have gone through, so it may be nearing the finish line.
Well, that explains why they didn’t know what to do at the county clerk’s office... I was looking in the wrong place. Thank you for your input. This case is very important to me so it’s worth the pay.
County clerk is deeds and wills and what not. Circuit clerk is court records. Call.or drop by his/her office and they will either have the transcript in the file, which is likely since a murder charge is going to get appealed, and the Supreme Court will demand a transcript. Or they will hook you up with the official court reporter.
You will need to know the name of the case and case number. The county clerk may not have access to transcripts If the case wasn't fully adjudicated yet (fully tried and through all the appeals, if any). You need to do more research and see if you can locate the case number.
I can access appeals through the online database. Do you think they may have the case number of the original trial?
