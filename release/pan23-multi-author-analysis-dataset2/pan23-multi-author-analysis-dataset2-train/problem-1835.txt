People coming over the Southern border are mostly Christians already. Mexico is Wildly Christian and it gets even more so the farther south you go. I’m pretty sure El Salvador actually translates to “the Savior” or something similar.
That’s why Christians go to work on people EARLY. If they can convince you that you were born an evil, worthless sack of shit right from the beginning they got you for LIFE. I am a former Christian and from a family of Christians and I can promise you that’s the absolute truth. It’s hard to believe this nonsense is still going on.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
