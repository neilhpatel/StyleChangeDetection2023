A cash transaction in and of itself is only odd, in all probability, and not illegal. The lack of any records or documentation regarding how they disposed of their ward's assets, and where the proceeds went, is far more concerning.
To go into a bit more detail the Bill of Sale lists a date 3 months before the cash was deposited into a reported account and the bill of sale lists no purchase price. To me it’s stinks but I’m wondering if there is anything preventing the use of cash by a conservator in an state.
That smells bad, I agree. I doubt it would be very productive to press the point that it was a cash transaction, but the whole pattern is more interesting.
Is the price a fair price for the car? Is there a reason you might believe that the conservator actually received a higher price and pocketed the difference? Is the buyer someone close to the conservator? What was the conservator's explanation for the delay in depositing the proceeds?
The car was a well maintained antique and was sold at scrap value, the conservator's given reason being that they didn't have a title. Yes they are direct family. No explanation was given for the delay as of yet.
Yep, it's time to get a lawyer involved. Immediately. I'd bet some amount of money, less than the value of an antique car, that the conservator bought the car back themselves, or worked with their family member and sold it to a collector to keep the proceeds.
Even if they didn't, selling a valuable asset for scrap likely violates a conservator's obligations to use their ward's assets in their best interests.
Whether legal action goes anywhere or not is harder to speculate on, but it's likely that someone interested in the ward's affairs could have the executor removed over this, at minimum. It is possible that the sale could be unwound or that the value of the car could be extracted from the executor, as well, but it's a more complicated question.
