Contact your insurance provider. There's some possibility that the dealership has responsibility as a bailee, but that's your insurance company's move unless you manage to convince the dealership to pay.
For instance, dropping your keys off in the night box would not generally create a "bailment" making the dealership responsible for your car until they can move it to a safer place.
If I were in your place, (and you have comprehensive coverage), I'd file a claim with my own insurance, pay the deductible, and let my insurance company worry about arguing with the dealership.
Because OP is in CA, and CA specifically has statutes in place that premiums may not increase because of Not At Fault claims, I concur with filing a comp claim on OPs policy if possible and letting insurance subrogate with the dealers insurance.
