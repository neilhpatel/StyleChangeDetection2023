Putin is in a corner, he can’t win in Ukraine, doesn’t want to lose Crimea, and doesn’t want to be kicked out of power. Should be interesting to see how this plays out.
I'm very much hoping for either his suicide or murder but am frightened of another possible scenario.
Having said that, you are being naive if you think Russia can't do some serious, SERIOUS damage. Even if 1% of their nukes got through, tens of millions could be killed. And that's without the nuclear fallout.
No they can't. He can't even successfully test a nuke or shit his pants without me knowing. With no comsec or opsec he can't get it off first so Russia gets destroyed. He loses everything all in the same moment. The US won't even need to use nukes. They are dated and clumsy weapons. Russia loses in every scenario. Russia is not a near peer threat to the US or NATO, just another fascist dictator losing in the midst humiliating military action in modern history.
It seems Putin doesn't know how to back down - it's almost as though his pride and ego won't let him. He cannot be rationally reasoned with.
Why would the west want peace talks. We are winning. Finland/Sweden in NATO, Russian military on the ropes and a continued example how bad a war with Taiwan could look to china.
