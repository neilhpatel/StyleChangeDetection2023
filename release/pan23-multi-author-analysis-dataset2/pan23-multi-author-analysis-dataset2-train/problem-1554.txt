I think as long as they have no reason to believe that you are going to harm yourself or others they can't tell anyone under essentially the same thing as doctor - Patience confidentiality.
And if I see one, I don’t think about doing anything to them (yes I’ve thought few times but barely), I just feel attracted to the hentai genre ones.
Still, even if I’m not addicted, I’m a pedo, I’m not proud of it. I don’t wanna hurt anybody and I wanna forget all of this. But if they tell anyone, I won’t be able to handle it. I already have social anxiety, that would be the cherry on the cake.
I don’t have the trust to tell my doctors. I just met them. And doctors aren’t perfect, what if they tell my family?
Yeah I mean just talk to a psychiatrist for a while see if you can trust them first then go from there don't let a maybe stop you from being better or else that maybe will become certain that it will get out. It's just some advice tho do what you want.
Yes, it would end up hurting people. It hurts me because even if it’s not illegal, it’s still wrong.
So they would only tell if I did you know. But since I only watched through Internet. I’ll get away with it?
You mean like piracy? Honestly most people in the world don't consider lolicon a crime because it's just a free expression of sexuality.
