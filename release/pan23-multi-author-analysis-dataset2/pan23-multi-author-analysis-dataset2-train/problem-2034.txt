State law determines who has the right to handle what is called “disposition of remains.” That’s “who has the right,” not “who is obliged to.” I am unsure from your post what state he lived in at the time of death, but most states have pretty similar laws.
In most cases, first priority is someone he named in writing or in a pre-paid funeral plan. Second is a spouse. Then, adult children, parents, siblings and more distant relatives. Anyone on the priority list can say they “are unable or unwilling to act.” Priority then goes to the next in line. All you need to do is to tell the family that you are unwilling to do it. If they balk, tough. You may want to put it in writing, as a funeral home may require that.
Incidentally, depending on where he lived, if he had no will, you are either his heir or split his estate with his child(ren). State law determines that. State law also determines who has the right to be in charge of his estate. First is someone he named in a will. Second is a spouse, and then the same as above.
If science does not want him you can also just tell his family you are fine with him being an “ unclaimed body” i.e. state cremates and disposes of him.
You can also refuse to handle his estate. That will not affect your ability to inherit. If you want nothing to do with any inheritance, you can refuse to accept it. That’s called “disclaiming.” Your share then goes to other heirs as specified in the will and/or state law.
