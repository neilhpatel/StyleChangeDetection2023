Please, in detail, with due consideration to all of the political and societal realities that granted, the US has brought upon herself - tell us how to fix this? Also, please tell us why all US Citizens should be tarred with the same brush?
Well it’s a waste of time because even the ‘good’ Americans just throw piles of excuses at each of these but here goes:
Realistically, it’s easy for you guys to say “we’re too far gone” - that’s been your argument since like the 1900s. Other countries have your legality on firearms but they have a disciplined population who don’t need to be treat like children to avoid mass shootings.
I’m not aiming this at you specifically, but damn, the amount of times I’ve had talks with Americans post-school shooting and it’s the same shit everytime.
If you want FREEDOM, start acting like it actually comes with a price and maybe your children won’t be the acceptable cost of rednecks shooting beer bottles.
I promise you as an American the majority of us want spree shootings to stop, but 1/3 of our country would rather breast feed their AR15 than allow for comprehensive gun reform to happen and to make it harder for people who shouldn’t have guns, get guns.
I know this is a joke, but I wonder how effective a gigantic leaflet drop would be to cut through the Kremlin domestic propaganda?
I guess it depends how much of the nation actually believes it, vs those who go along with it because they think fighting back is hopeless.
Conversely, one could Mossad the fuck out of these monsters till they become dust. Then go after their legacy.
7. Stop glorifying gangs and “freedoms” as if they aren’t the same thing - selfish actors that result in nothing but harm to those around them.
Brilliantly brutal, and so abhorrent that 90% of us can't see why it's happening because 'nobody could be that evil. Could they?'.
8. Accept America’s problems are a direct result of its population (other countries with similar laws don’t have similar results.).
