Unfortunately, IMO the reason we don't take it seriously is there are a frightening number of people in positions of power who may not agree with their means, but actually agree with these crazy people's end goals.
In just the current population of Australia half of us have at least one parent born overseas, a quarter of us were born overseas and immigrated, myself included.
We came here with nothing and we came because it was safe, because of its capitalist prosperity, because it is fair and just to all who are willing to put in the work and has a good social safety net.
The joke is that Australia was founded from the exportation of folks of faiths not agreeing with the english/British church.
As well be angry at Sweden and Norway for the Viking invasions of Britain. It's a different time with completely different people. The name Australia is the only thing contiguous. Do we need to restart the place under a different name to help people move on? Cause I don't think asking everyone to leave is going to work.
I agree that they were exporting "criminals" - a la catholics and anyone with the wrong last names. Very few actual criminals from a modern perspective.
