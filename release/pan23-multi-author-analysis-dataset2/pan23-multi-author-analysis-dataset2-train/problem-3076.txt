Yes comrades, we are unstoppable in our mission to capture Ukraine Kyiv Sumy Kharkiv Kherson Bhakmut Soledar which is clearly a huge victory and definitely not only a costly Pyyrhic victory for what amounts only to a small town.^/s.
They basically took all their forces they were using to assault a pre-war 70k populated city to take a small town of 10k. And now they’ve given away their assault tactics.
Even losing Bakhmut isn’t a massive loss. The Ukrainians have been defending these positions while the Russians take massive casualties trying to take them.
There is now a full encirclement of the city, not every Ukrainian troop was evacuated or able to get out in time.
Lots of equipment, weapons, ammunition, supplies, vehicles were also lost/left behind in the hasty/late evacuation.
If Russia losing 400+ men in the NYE HIMARS strike was devastating all the more is the effect on losing Soledar because casualties would be much higher than 400.
Russia had fire control of the roads leading out of Soledar. When you have to retreat under fire there will be casualties.
