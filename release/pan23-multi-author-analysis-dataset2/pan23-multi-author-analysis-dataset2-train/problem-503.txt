Most of those wouldn't be done by states or state-backed actors, but by lone wolf or insurgency groups that the US can't really 'declare war' on. States killing diplomats is historically a famously bad move, and more than one state has even ceased to exist thanks to the other state taking revenge for their murdered diplomats. The Mongol invasion of Persia is a great example of this, where the Khan sent diplomats to Persia to discuss a trade relationship, and the local governor arrested and murdered them. When the Khan sent diplomats to the Persian Sultan demanding the governor be handed over for punishment, the Sultan had them killed too. The Mongols then proceeded to spend decades wiping entire Persian cities off the face of the earth and slaughtering millions, causing damage that in some places still hasn't been repaired to this day.
Russians are Barbarians that invader a nation of kinfolk bc too proud to accept free food bc a famine of their making.
Expelling them is pretty much the only thing Russia can safely do. If they attacked or harmed the embassy or staff in any way, the US could consider it an act of war. The only way Russia can survive a war with the US right now, is if the US wants them to.
An attack on her or the embassy would serve as a direct act of war against the US, and they have no veil to hide behind to pretend it was not state sanctioned. They have a vested interest in ensuring the embassy's safety as even an accident could be declared -with good reason- as intentional and no one would bat an eye.
