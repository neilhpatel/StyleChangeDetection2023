Not on Reddit so much but if you go anywhere else on social media is pretty much how Tecumseh described is what’s happening.
Very much news to me. Up until this post, all I knew about Whelan was that he was a "retired Marine" and wondered why We seemed more interested in the return of a sports star than a Vet. This story is very important context for me.
Okay maybe I’m missing something here, but you are aware he’s retired correct. Not trying to be an asshole, it’s just that you’re comment can be interpreted by other’s that he’s actively still serving in the military.
People are disguising it by saying their,Griner who last I heard went by BG, activism for the black community ie kneeling at the anthem and being outspoken against government policies that harm minorities means they hate America and what not.
