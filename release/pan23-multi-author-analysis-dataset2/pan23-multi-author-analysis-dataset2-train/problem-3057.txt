It's identity theft but to be clear did your GF know about this for years and do nothing about it other than taking some of the money? In that case she'd probably have to sue her mother. The mother should be responsible but there were lost chances at mitigation, perhaps.
my gf was aware that loans were being taken, but never told the amount other than freshman year when the mother told her it would be 2,000. she was not active in looking at how the school was being paid. Scholarships paid for almost 85% of her tuition due to merit and financial aid. The mother used loans to pay for the rest. she was never told the amount being taken nor when they were taken nor whether they were subsidies or not. (Her mother took out both).
Your GF should have been asking more questions and paying more attention. The money was used for her benefit. She was an adult long ago, and what would she have done if she knew, dropped out to avoid the loans? But anyway, these appear to be her loans. Even if her mother broke a law, your GF benefitted from that crime.
I don't disagree that she used the money to her benefit and i agree then need to be paid, but shouldn't the mother be forced to pay for the 7,000 over at minimum? also thank you for your help.
I always still had to sign that stuff when my mother filled out forms for me. Did she sign something? Not sure if that would make it harder for her if she did, but if mom forged her signature, thatâ€™s definitely something to bring up.
from what i understand my gf was a dependent at the time and the mother logged into my gfs FASFA and took the loans out in my gfs name. My gf never signed anything. They were not parent plus.
