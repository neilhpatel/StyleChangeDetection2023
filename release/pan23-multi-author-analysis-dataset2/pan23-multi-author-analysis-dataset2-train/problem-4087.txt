Most lawyers will offer free or discounted initial consultations. Take advantage of this time to speak to several lawyers and gauge their response. A lawyer worth using will take time to listen to your concerns, answer your questions (within the constraint of that initial consult), and will use words like "some possible outcomes include" and "the big challenges I see are". If the lawyer makes you feel rushed, pressured, or uncomfortable, or if they tell you this is an easy win or an "open and shut case", or if you feel like they aren't listening to your claims, then thank them for their time and move on to the next.
