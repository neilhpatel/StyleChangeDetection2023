Thank you so much. I will consult with a tenant lawyer. Since I need to hire movers (and piano movers) now, does he owe me both of these expenses? Luckily my parents live fairly close so I didn’t need to pay for alternate housing. How likely is it that I would be able to recoup legal fees?
No, not in any state, you can sue him for the costs you incurred (hotel, etc.) over the illegal eviction.
How much could he legally charge me for storage? Would he need to go through a lawyer for that? A few weeks ago, I would have never thought he would be so vindictive, but I would have been wrong. I can see him trying to charge me to store it just out of spite.
If you want the piano, you need to pay for piano movers. If he wants it, then you leaving it seems like a win-win. In theory he could store it and charge you for that, but why would he?
Thanks for your quick response. I do not want the piano. He had expressed in text that he was interested, but while kicking me out, yelling, decided he doesn’t want it and I need to pay to have it removed.
