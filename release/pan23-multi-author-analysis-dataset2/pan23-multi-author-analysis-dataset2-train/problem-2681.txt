You are compensated for your time. If your employee decides to provide an extra benefit to other employees provided you are not excluded because of your inclusion in a protective class that is perfectly legal subject of course to employment contracts. This is assuming a US location.
I'm not sure I understand your response, can you help me? It seems they are excluding employees who are not parents. I didn't think being a parent was a protected class in the USA.
It seems like it is illegal to discriminate against pregnant employees, but it's not clear to me whether or not you can discriminate against someone who does not have children. Thoughts?
Ok, I think I understand now. "Familial status" does not mean "if you are a parent or if you are not a parent" but it means "you are a parent". Right?
These are the types of questions a good lawyer asks clients. Rather than listening to client say two sentences and then responding "perfectly legal" without asking for more facts or asking what state law applies.
In most states, familial status covers "families with children under the age of 18, pregnant persons, and any person in the process of securing legal custody of a minor child.".
What's the company's reasoning for giving four days of (paid?) leave to the mother and father of a 10 year old child who conform to the traditional Christian gender stereotype of being parents, but not giving that paid leave to two lesbians with a husky?
You declared the employer's actions to be "perfectly legal" without even asking what state law was involved.
Now we know the state is North Carolina, which unlike many states has no state-specific laws prohibiting familial status discrimination. Yet you've flipped your answer to "it's not clear to me whether or not you can discriminate against someone who does not have children.".
Follows the federal rule. Familial status protects people with minor children, or those who are pregnant, or trying to adopt. They couldn't give NON parents more time off. If I ran the company I'd give parents 5 days, pet owners 3 days, and Vikings fans every Monday off.
