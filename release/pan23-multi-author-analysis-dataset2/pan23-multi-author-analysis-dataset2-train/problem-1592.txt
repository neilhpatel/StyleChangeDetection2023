The Ukrainian national is currently in Ukraine. If Ukraine manages to capture him they'll most likely extradite him to the Netherlands as that would Garner them a lot of support and goodwill.
The Russians like to mop up loose ends. Capturing him would be an international incident that would make Russia look bad. You do the math.
ok I smashed some equations together, simplified, and substituted in values and it works out to 7.62x54r,but I don't know what 'r' means here so I'll leave it in that form.
I think you mean 7.62x51n, here right? And although that's certainly possible, following my inference you should get to 7.62x39r. Although the real curious part is if you choose some different initial conditions you can find yourself with 5.54x39r, which, get this, produces the exact same results!
I was thinking more along the lines of a Russian sniper rifle, but it probably would just be a mosin from the pile no one was willing to pay money for!
Surrendering might be his best chance at living a long life, albeit in prison. He's not safe in Ukraine, and Russia will put him in an unmarked grave, and it's unlikely he has a forged passport and a Cayman Islands account like some Bond villain but who knows?
