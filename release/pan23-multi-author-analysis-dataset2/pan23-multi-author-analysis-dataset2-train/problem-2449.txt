I have only ever come across references to Tlatlacateculo ("Owl Men") once. And I gave a brief summary in this topic titled . In essence, though, Tlatlacateculo likely used a combination of prayer, totems, and knowledge of plants and animals to cure, kill, or torment (usually in their dreams) other people including other witches. I'm basing this assumption on more recent ethnographic work on historic and contemporary Nahua witches in Mexico (Knab 1995). The shapeshifting, or nagual, aspect factors into the dream world. Each person has a nagual that is linked to them that lives in the dream world. What happens to one, happens to the other. So witches can use their nagual in their dreams to harm or help the naguals of others while they are dreaming. This might even be considered a form of psychological warfare if someone begins to become sick or has insomnia and begins to believe that someone is attacking them in their sleep. But to repeat, I am making these speculations based on more recent ethnographic work.
1995 A war of witches: a journey into the underworld of the contemporary Aztecs. Harper Collins, San Francisco.
I cannot recall what Knab said about what determines a person's nagual and I do not currently have his book on hand. I do recall that a person's nagual could be any animal, but tended to not to be exotic. Knab's nagual, for example, was an opossum after he had attempted to learn about the dream world.
This is probably a strange question, but was there any connection between the Owl Men and Mictecacihuatl?
In more recent times, we have the Mexican saint, Santa Muerte, who is closely associated with owls and who some believe evolved from the worship of Mictecacihuatl, which made me wonder about the possible connection eith the Owl Men.
