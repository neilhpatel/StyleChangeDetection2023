The first question is did the father own anything of value, does he have a house that he has more than $50,000 in equity? At that point, its probably a good Idea to get a trust and estate attorney on it asap, rather than screw around with the roommate.
If the father was renting living on benefits and only had a vehicle and or other possessions, work with the room mate on getting sentimental items, and have your boyfriend do a small estate affidavit for everything else.
If he died intestate without a will, and we will assume your boyfriend is the only living decendent and there is no wife, he basically gets everything. He is a vet so hopefully someone with military experience will chime in, but I think you also contact the VA about burial options.
Finally if you know his social security number, running a credit check is the best way to see if he has any money, as pretty much everything associated with him will be on his credit report.
We thankfully have his social so we can do the credit check thing so that should help a ton. Thank you.
we have no idea about anything. im trying to avoid all of that but i think this might be the path that we will take for this whole thing. it sad because we dont want to fight we just want this done quickly so that we can morn properly.
He was not rich by any means it was mostly just sentimental things that we wanted. We know he had some savings and a puppy he just got. We mostly care about the family photos and his military uniform.
Did you father have an attorney? Or a financial advisor? These are good people to ask if they know if he had a will. If not, and the girlfriend is not letting you into his home, itâ€™s time for an estate attorney.
