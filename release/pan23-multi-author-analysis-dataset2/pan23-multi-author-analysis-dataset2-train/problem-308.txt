Hi - we as mods have approved this thread, because while this is a homework question, it is asking for clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself, which is fine according to . This policy is further explained in this and this .
There’s quite a bit of crossover though. It’s more to do with the topic and the question, rather than there being any hard and fast rules. Essays should be a reflection of your personality as a student, so bear that in mind too. That’s why it’s important for students to have fun writing them. They’re expressive, by their very nature.
Thank you very much for the in depth response! The prompt is quite vague, simply asking us to "discuss recent trends and debates between historians regarding a subject of your choosing". Would you suppose that the essay should be more analytical or passive? Thanks.
