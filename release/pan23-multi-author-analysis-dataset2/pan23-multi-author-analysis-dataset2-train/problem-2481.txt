What this headline doesn't tell is the multitude of other huge changes were just announced here this afternoon. Regualr COVID testing for most people - gone. "Health codes" being checked to enter any enclosed space - gone. Domestic travel within China - totally opened up.
If these new rules are actually implemented, which I'm sure will take a couple of weeks, this is an enormous change. If you don't live here in China, it is probably very hard to understand the magnitude of what was announced today. This is a huge window of hope for the younger generations of Chinese who have been absolutely shat on by Zero-COVID for the past three years.
Ok now you’re just actively ignoring reality, regardless if you agree or disagree with the policy, they’re responding to events such as this and more which you can look up yourself. 43 people dead and 90 wounded is propaganda eh?
The Uyghur and camps issue relates to terrorism, not a suppression of protests. It’s not relevant here to a how the CCP responds to protests.
