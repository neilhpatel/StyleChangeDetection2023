If the conditions are bad you have to drive slower than the speed limit, or at least, at a speed that doesn't allow you to hydroplane. Glad you're okay.
NAL. I'm not intending this to sound rude, but it is your responsibility to drive in a manner that is safe for the conditions of the road. If the weather was bad, and it was raining, it is expected that you would slow to a safe speed (whatever that may be), to account for the conditions of the road.
Adding to this (which I agree with completely) you also have an obligation to maintain control of your vehicle - which means / goes along with driving the below the speed limit if conditions warrant. You can still get a ticket for going to speed limit if that speed is unsafe for the conditions.
Ethically and Legally you are responsible for the damage to the sign. Your liability insurance should help with that. The others telling you that you should have driven slower are only telling you the expectations of the law. It was an accident, bit you still have the responsibility to accept liability. If is 100% your fault, even if it was an accident. The rain was a major factor.
