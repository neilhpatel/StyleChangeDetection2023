Time for one of those interfaith coalitions to file a class action suit over Establishment Clause violations. I'm sure there are some Jews, Muslims, and other non-Christians in OKC who would not appreciate their tax dollars going towards this.
Sadly, this is more than likely going to happen here. Republicans last year filed a bill to ban teaching anything that "violates a student's religious beliefs", and they all but want creationism only taught in schools. If you are going to pick a state where the Scopes Monkey Trial is destined to happen next, Oklahoma's the favorite.
Here's the endgame for school choice. Now, religious schools are undermining separation of church and state, taking public tax dollars to discriminate against secular students. The Stitt-show is destroying our state all the way! Stitt and Walters want to make the state into a theocracy and a fascist state, and it is despicable.
