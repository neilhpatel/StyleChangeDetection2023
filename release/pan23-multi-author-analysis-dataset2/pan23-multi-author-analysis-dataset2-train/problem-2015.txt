They have a better offer they want to take and need you to cancel the sale. If they cancel you could sue for breach of contract. The reasons for a seller to cancel a home sale in CA are very specific. They can just make it hard on you so you walk away.
It’s either that or the fact that it’s a city with a 1% black population and the seller’s agent (older) wants to keep it that way. This is what leads me to believe it isn’t the sellers. The sellers (young) hand selected us from multiple offers. They had other offers from day one.
Buyers being black is important info. The fair housing act covers real estate agents. You might want to check out the CA website. It seems like you might be able to file a complaint.
They do not have to accept extensions or repair requests at all, unless they have agreed to them in writing. Your best bet is to accept the house as-is if you want it. Unfortunately, with FHA, that may not be possible.
Plenty of reasons not to allow someone who does not yet own the house unrestricted access and permission to repair.
