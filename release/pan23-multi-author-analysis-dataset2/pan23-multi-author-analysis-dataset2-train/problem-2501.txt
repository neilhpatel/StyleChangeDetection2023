And they will mobilize them and it will be bloody, but your forgetting the most important thing about war, logistics. They have to train, feed, supply, transport and communicate with them. There train and air network is breaking down due to the fact they import most of their supplies for those networks from the West, and they canâ€™t easily switch them to other suppliers. So it will be hard to get them all to training, the front, and supply them. Will also make it hard for them to send 100ks of troops to suppress the Caucus or any region at the Urals or beyond that decide they want to keep their tax money to themselves. A large number of their experienced troops died or were maimed in the opening conflict which makes it hard to train new conscripts. And they are out of supplies. Their industry sucks and their Soviet stockpile was looted and allowed to rust. They will have horrible weapons.
There are thousands there with decades of experience fighting the Taliban. I hope someday they can come together and defeat the Taliban.
