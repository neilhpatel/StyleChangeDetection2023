I don't get it. How is that relevant? I get what a prisoner exchange is. Doesn't mean it was equal. Russia obviously worked us on this one and everyone knows it. Hopefully Griner really appreciates every future day in the US and isn't so willing to think status puts her above foreign laws.
Viktor Bout, an arms trader who armed narco-terrorists in Latin America, was just returned to Russia. A country which is at war and in desperate need of guns so they can genocide any Ukrainians who don't want to be Russian.
You could easily swap Oliver North with Viktor Bout and itâ€™s the same story. No surprise this all happened so suddenly right after the Georgia run-off.
I'm not saying it was a good deal, we had little leverage. My point is I'd rather have my govt fight for my release even if I'm an average Joe citizen.
You probably also wouldn't have gone to Russia though. And if you did, maybe not during a time of war and high tensions. And if you did probably not with illegal drugs on you and if you did you could stay. Might help the US in it's education metrics.
I'm agreeing with you, it wasnt an equal exchange. When you dont have that bargaining leverage, it's going to be an unequal deal no matter how you do it.
