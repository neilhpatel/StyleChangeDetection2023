It must take great restraint to not avenge yourself, and also trust enough that their surrender was genuine. And also in those circumstances to not fire on instinct, upon sight, when nerves kick in of "it's us or them". Must be a difficult scenario to negotiate.
This is the complete vid, with Ukrainians throwing nades into the trenches after the remaining Russians wouldn't come out.
This is not the complete video. At least do your research. Shortly after this the Ukrainians start throwing grenades into the wholes where the remaining Russians are sitting.
The majority of casualties in this war are from artillery and mortars, not drones dropping what amount to grenades.
For sure, I know if I was in those conditions and of that war mindset my initial response would be "fuck you, you don't deserve to live - come here to take my land, rape my women, steal my children and indiscriminate carpet bombing of our civilians" I'd find it too difficult to restrain myself from mowing the lot of them down.
