The instant you start making unilateral, irreversible decisions, you run the risk of going further than you have a legal right to, which could result in you having to rebuild stuff. Getting a consultation from a lawyer is much cheaper than rebuilding a shed or a fence.
If you can get the survey docs from the city, take that + a satellite view from Google Maps to a lawyer, along with any other documentation, and ask them what your options are. You may also need to know how old his shed is, so it's best to look that up first.
This right here. OP there have been so many cases of "well what we are doing is legal" that get blown up because of some tiny detail that got missed. Ask yourself this, which will cost less? A lawsuit filed by your neighbor in which you have a lawyer that has irrefutable proof you were in the right. Or a lawsuit filed by your neighbor and you have to hope and pray to the legal gods you checked all the boxes off. In both cases you'll probably have to have a lawyer to defend you. But being proactive can save you infinitely more time and money than just saying "well so and so at city hall said it was ok.".
I’m hearing you guys say make damn sure we have all the proper documentation and don’t trust that the city knows everything. Get a survey done and consult with a lawyer regardless.
In this situation you wouldn't hire a lawyer because you've done something wrong; you would hire a lawyer because lawyers have expertise in the laws that affect this situation. It's not practical for you to learn all the law you need to navigate this, but a lawyer already has the specialized knowledge to help you.
