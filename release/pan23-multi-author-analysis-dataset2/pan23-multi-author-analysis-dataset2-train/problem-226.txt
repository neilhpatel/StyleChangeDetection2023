But if he’s not insured you have to weigh the potential recovery amount (that he’s capable of paying) against lawyer fees, time and stress.
Civil suits are separate from criminal charges. I’m NAL and not from your state but I would bet that you can sue him for negligence.
God thats so dumb dude. If he had insurance I would be completely fine, but since he doesn’t and hes broke i have to be responsible for getting hit by a psychopath. Great.
Thanks. I will need more details about him when the police report comes out. I think I may be able to just make him pay me restitution without having to really spend a lot on legal fees, and he can just pay it overtime, OR if the car he hit me with is insured at all (unlikely since the plates werent right) I may be able to go after that person’s insurance or something. Not getting my hopes up, but its pretty bs that I have to pay for someone elses crime done to me, the victim.
It’d be worth seeing if you can get an initial consultation with a lawyer. Gather the total value lost before you go in, and see if they think it’s worth pursuing.
You may be able to get a payment plan or something in a settlement or maybeee court garnished wages for failure to pay. But I don’t know if either of those are possible (hence the look for a consultation).
