Not giving free water to a dancer is a really crappy thing to do, but unless that dancer has an employee/employer relationship, it's not against the law to deny them water. OSHA rules specifically say "employer must provide potable water." So the burden is on someone to show where there 's another rule besides OSHA that mandates that an independent contractor be provided free water. Let's say it's an electrician who comes to your food cart to make a repair. Do they have a right to your water for free? No they don't. This is no different.
Until you show me the rule, you’re just guessing and making stuff up. You literally don’t have a clue what you’re talking about.
I didn't downvote you. 🤷🏼‍♀️ My point is just that drinkable water must exist somewhere since the company likely had actual employees, and she can probably have some of that without much trouble. I'd there's no drinkable water anywhere, then she could recommend that the employees complain to OSHA.
Yes, for THOSE employees. Not an independent contractor. There’s no law requiring the company provide free water to independent contractors and somehow I’m getting downvoted for explaining the obvious.
