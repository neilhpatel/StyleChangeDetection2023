What does your lease say about breaking the lease? They likely aren't using the security deposit for rent because then they are out the security deposit.
While you may have given them 2 months notice they really can't start advertising the apartment until you are actually moved out, Incase you change your mind or they need to do some repairs.
Additionally Florida, unlike many other states, does not require landlords to mitigate their losses for a lease being broken. So unless there is any language in the lease stating what occurs when breaking the lease, they are allowed to charge you for each month of the lease and are not required to actually lease the apartment with a new tenant.
So again it really comes down to your lease. Your leasing company does not matter (except if it comes down to their policies) what matters is the lease.
So the lease says that I could be charged until the point it ends, which would be like.. 3ish months. I guess technically 2 months would be a "deal," but it's still a lot of money. Especially for a place that was flooded with 2.5 inches of water from an upstairs water heater break that ruined years of work I put into my paintings stored in the closet where the flood started, and that has had ongoing early morning to night loud construction for the last month and a half. I just want to leave, it seems half easier to just get evicted than to break a lease at this point haha.
Eviction is not easier. You will still owe the money and you will then have an eviction on your record which will make renting harder. Your renters insurance should have taken care of the water damage (monetarily anyways).
They are under no obligation to allow you to use your security deposit for rent. Once you hand in your key and so your walk through they will prepare a list of itemized deductions and return whatever portion of your security deposit is not needed.
