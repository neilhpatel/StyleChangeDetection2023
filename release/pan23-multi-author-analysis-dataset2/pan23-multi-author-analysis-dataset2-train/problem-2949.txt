If Republicans did not have voter suppression, gerrymandering, election tampering schemes (as described in the article), etc., they would never win another election of consequence.
But the proposal to eliminate the grace period for mail-in ballots is obviously an attempt to disenfranchise Democratic voters. Similar proposals have been shot down by courts in other states, so I don't think this will go anywhere. But as we know, Republicans will stop at nothing to restrict voting and to invalidate ballots as they throw everything against the wall to see what sticks.
I actually support the runoff rule. I think a run off election to secure a majority vote is solidly democratic in principle and I see no reason to oppose it. Also I see no reason why that should give either party an advantage.
