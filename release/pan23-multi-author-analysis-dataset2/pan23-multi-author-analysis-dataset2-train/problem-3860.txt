I get your point but this is not a "hate parade". I am just reciting what the native Indians tell us in their own words from the book "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West" I am 3/4 of the way through it and I can truly say we were brutal to the mostly peace loving natives of this land of plenty. That was 100+ years ago so I don't nor am I trying to guilt anyone hers. I am responding to what the governor of Florida is up to in his efforts to bury the past so we could potentially repeat our history of suppressing those that don't look like white people with all the wealth and power over the poor and voiceless. If you spent time traveling the world as I have, you find their are great humans in every culture which informs my views on such matters. I live in a state with many Indian reservations with very nice people I have come to know. They seem to be doing fine with casinos, hotels etc. so at least we can look to that as a form of unbroken treaties. I do not recall being taught to this depth of the American Indian history so I learn of it in shock.
A similar operation had already been done in the 90's, but in the last years the government simply turned a blind eye to what was happening. Brazil has enough resources, knowledge and institutions to combat that situation, letting it come to this point was a (possibly criminal) political choice.
