It's about time to contact the police. Two sets of bizarre "gifts" in less than a week would suggest that this is only the beginning. If this person really does have a child with this player, they can go through the courts like everyone else.
The police can contact the NBA player if they think it's appropriate to do so. You have no legal obligation to reach out to him directly or indirectly nor do you have to tell your neighbors about what's going on if you don't want to.
ETA: You've made a smart decision by not contacting the number on the letter. If this person really is delusional, you're not going to be able to convince them that you have no association with the NBA player.
If there is no cause for concern, the police will likely let them know that they should not enter the building unless they live there or have been specifically invited in by a resident. If there is cause for concern, the police can handle it, but only if you report it.
Call the police and file a report. This person does not belong in the building and is obviously causing you concern. The police can investigate and determine whether this person is a danger to themselves or anyone else. They can also determine whether anyone should be warned about this person's behavior and will know how to go about making those warnings.
