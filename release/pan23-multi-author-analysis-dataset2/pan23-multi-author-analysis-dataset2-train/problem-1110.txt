Lmao I had to look this up.. she legit canceled for LGBT+ and the Black Eyes Peas were the backup.. and then they accepted the gig but wore pro LGBT+ accessories.
We usually have bands like Boney M or Modern Talking for the New Year's Eve concert, so BEP is a real breath of fresh air; last year's "star" was Jason Derulo xD.
Liz Mitchell from Boney M was a headliner of the New Year's Eve concert last year, as well as Dr Alban. But the concert was organized by a private TV station (Polsat), not the public one (TVP), so they didn't have the budget for super-relevant stars like Mel C or BEP (TVP is financed with taxpayers' money).
To be honest, this title is a bit misleading - the "government politicians" are from a small coalition party "solidarna polska" which is further right than the average government officials and only has something like 1% support on its own. Without them current government would lose the majority, and right now they'll also be losing the elections. Our next elections are autumn so we'll hopefully get rid of all of this bullshit by same time next year.
because it is something they actually say! i was introduced to RATM by my very conservative father. i also regularly hear things like "conservatives are the new hippies" ðŸ¥´.
