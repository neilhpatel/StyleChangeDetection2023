If you're interested in Early Modern siege warfare, a brisk introduction can be found in the form of Christopher Duffy's Fire and Stone: The Science of Fortress Warfare, 1660-1860 (1975, 2nd ed. 1996), which covers the general principles of attacking and defending bastion forts. Or, if you want a more specific case study, Tonio Andrade's Lost Colony (2011) narrates in great detail the siege of the Dutch fort at Zeelandia in 1661-2 by Ming Dynasty loyalists seeking to use Taiwan as a base to continue their resistance against the Manchu Qing.
The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815 by Richard White.
I'd really like to begin reading about Native American culture. I realize this is broad, as there were many tribes with very different cultures, practices, and beliefs. But I don't know where to start. I am particularly interested in their diets, health practices, mythologies and religious beliefs.
I'd recommend the following books as great places to start. Take a look at each book. If you're interested in any of them see if your uni/local library has it (there's a good bet any university will have these accessible online).
