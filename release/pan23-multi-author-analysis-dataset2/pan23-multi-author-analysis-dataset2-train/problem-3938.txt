It's uniquely easy to bring up reminders of EAPs right now, as everyone suffers from some distress/stress/anxiety after 16 months of the pandemic, and potentially re-opening anxiety as well.
If you have EAP, they may have good resources as well. You can bring it up casually or as a reminder to staff if you're concerned about singling her out or feeling awkward about bringing it up. Unfortunately as of now there's nothing legal/illegal about the situation.
Even if you did have enough to call the police, that's at best a bandaid and at worst makes the situation objectively worse. There's no shortage of stories of battered women bailing their SO's out only to have the abuse continue, or be worse.
You can only single a person out with the recommendation if they come to you privately for assistance.
It sounds like you're already in the right headspace here, but you want to make sure she's in the driver's seat for any kind of response here.
Bringing it up in general, sure. Addressing possible domestic violence can be a lot more challenging and potentially offensive to the employee and the employer should tread carefully.
