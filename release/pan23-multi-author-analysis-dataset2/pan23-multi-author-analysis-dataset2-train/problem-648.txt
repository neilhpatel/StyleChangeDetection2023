NAL, but work for animal control. Please contact Animal Control in the jurisdiction where this “shelter” is and report this person; what she is doing is illegal. (If you’re unsure who handles AC, call the non-emergency police in that city and ask them who to call.) Keep records of your kittens health (photos of her, her weight, and any physical issues) and a written statement from your vet as to age and health issues. None of this will help you, but it hopefully will get her “rescue” shut down. Thank you for caring for this kitten, I hope she has long healthy life!
The goal is for her to have a long, healthy, happy life! She has my roommate and myself caring for her and a feline sister she already loves. She’s such a sweetheart.
IANAL. In most states, cats are considered property and can be bought and sold. She might be able to sue you in small claims for the price of the kitten, but that's all she's going to get. If she contacts you (unlikely by the sound of it), just tell her that you were delayed getting home and thought the vaccines were likely bad so went to your vet. If she asks about spaying say you don't feel like driving all the way to her vet so you're going to get her spayed at your vet, offer to send her a copy of the spaying certificate. Don't make any allegations or anything like that, try not to antagonize her, just say your doing this for your convenience.
For the time being, report this person to the relevant authorities. The cat you received was severely neglected and probably weaned too early, but not sure if that is legally cruel... Certainly is cruel in my view. The appropriate person is probably the local animal control.
