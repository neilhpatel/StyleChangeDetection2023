Remove anything that isn't pertinent otherwise nobody that can help is gonna read it. You moving 6 years ago has nothing to do with you trying to cash for keys and sell the place.
You have a lousy tenant yes, but you’re culpable here too. You allowed them to push you around because you didn’t want to deal with it. Deferring payments and losing the house isn’t really their issue.
Hindsight being 20/20 - you should have started the eviction process months ago. Or - depending on the lease lenh, you could have provided a “notice to quit.” To begin the documentation process.
She then said "OK" and to contact her lawyer... who then took 2 more days to get back to us. The funny thing is that our original offer was actually 3500 for Sept. 1s and 50 dollars less for each day thereafter... she ended up taking extra time because of her lawyer and greed and went from 3500 to 3400, LMFAO.
We stayed firm and told her to fuck off with the 2000 dollar request... but we, like her, waited until the last minute.
What else can you realistically do? Can you get a short-term loan to keep the house afloat until you can actually get her evicted?
You know what your options are. Pay the extra money and hope she actually leaves or, begin the eviction process and lose your house.
I couldn't start the eviction process... I tried to literally the month before covid and there has been a moratorium ever since.
I let them push me around because I had no other option - I couldn't afford anything else... I'm not culpable... I couldn't afford to evict her UNTIL I had a deferred payment plan, jeeze, and I couldn't evict them because of the cause of that deferred payment plan, so just stop. Hindsight isn't 20/20 when you couldn't afford any of your options, lmao.
