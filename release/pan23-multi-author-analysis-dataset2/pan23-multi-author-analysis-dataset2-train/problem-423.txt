Well here's the rub, then. He's likely entitled to that pay. He can lawfully go after that pay. They can lawfully change his negotiated pay to offset that amount. So, the question you have to ask yourself is the fight really worth it to see if they don't offset that amount?
It's very very unlikely that $600 would be what pushes him into a higher tax bracket, and even if it somehow did, the way income tax works he'd only pay higher taxes on the amount exceeding that bracket.
The only case where higher income actually hurts is if it pushes you over the income limit for social welfare programs like food stamps, disability, etc.
I'm leaning towards bullshit myself, at least in OP's instance, but a lot of people don't understand how marginal tax rates work. Even so, there are valid reasons for people to believe that a higher income will leave them worse off.
There are some welfare programs that don't taper off, they cut off completely if your income goes over a certain level. So if you're on minimum wage, you're eligible for a certain welfare payment, but if you get another .25c an hour, you don't qualify for it, and lose the lot, leaving you materially worse off.
