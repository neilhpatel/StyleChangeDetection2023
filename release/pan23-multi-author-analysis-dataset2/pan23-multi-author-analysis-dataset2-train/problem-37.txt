Document, document, document. Every time she takes some, how much she takes, what she said, what others said. Time and date it all. If shit hits the fan for some reason- even if its just an allergy (bc teenagers throw a lot of hormones that mess with ADHD meds)- you do not want to be responsible for a MIP/UI, abuse, or negligence. I'd also write down everything you recall of the DCF visit. If you don't remember much, you can usually make a public records request for their public notes- it takes a while but can be worth it just so you have all of that on hand if the day comes. If you can't/shouldn't get out and can't stop her, you need to be as bullproof as possible bc FL will make you a felon in a heartbeat.
Your mother stealing your medication is a crime and you could report it to the police. You are an adult, that is theft.
Your mother kicking you out of the home via an eviction is also totally a possibility. Again, you are an adult, your mother no longer has any obligation to house you.
This is one of those situations where you will need to evaluate your options. There is no option which allows you to stop your mother from stealing your medication and force her to allow you to live in her home.
