My field is urban history, and the book I would recommend is undoubtedly Lewis Mumford's The City in History. To me, it is one of the greatest books ever written, not that many people have ever heard of it! However, at 700+ pages it is quite the journey â€“ it took me a whole summer to get through on its own, let alone forming part of a reading list. However, if you were ever interested in exploring the history of urbanisation, this is the place to start.
Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom is a sublime (if mostly political-military) account of the later years of the Taiping Civil War. Platt deftly navigates between the Taiping capital, the Qing loyalist general Zeng Guofan, and the Western presence on the coast, to produce a narrative that is, while not absolutely comprehensive, still relatively so, and utterly gripping as well. Despite the heaviness of the subject matter and the relatively high-level focus, Platt really manages to capture the human element in it all, and to put it bluntly I adore this book. It is what got me into wanting to actually do history.
