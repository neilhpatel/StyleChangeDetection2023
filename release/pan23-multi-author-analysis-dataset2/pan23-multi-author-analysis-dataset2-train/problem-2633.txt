He calls himself Aristocrat because he can trace his lineage to some minor house in 19th century who were Aristocrats.
Well guess what, i can also trace my line to soem Aristocrats in 19th century. Still doesnt make me or him an Aristocrat.Its just dellusion from him.
Thats the dumbest part of this to me. Like if he was descended from one of the big houses I could maybe see even the slightest chance that anybody important entertains his claim. But no, this dude was from a family who spent their entire landed history as Saxony and/or Prussias bitch. Even if the entire military and bureaucracy secretly had monarchist leanings, he would be exactly nobodies choice.
Isnt sovereign citizen about denying all state authority? Wanting to reinstate a 1937 German empire doesn't sound quite the same as not accepting the identity society gives to you (and the whole rabbit hole that leads down).
It does have a slightly different reasoning behind it, but that's all. It wouldn't surprise me if the whole sovereign citizen idea was just transplanted to Germany and just barely adapted. There's always people searching for a reason to not pay taxes after all.
It's basically the same. I think the people propagating it even just Google translate some of their stuff.
