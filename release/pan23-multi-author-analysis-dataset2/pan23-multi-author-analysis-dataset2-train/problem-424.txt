A lot of the legal advice you get is not going to apply in practice because of the way the state and police are actually handling the homeless crisis here (as you have come to find out) vs everyday burglars and whatnot. They’re not really doing anything in these situations unless the person is violent or threatening in some way.
Otherwise you can wait until she does something violent and threatening and report that to the police. That is what folks are being told to do right now in similar situations. No, this is not how the law is “supposed” to work, but with everything going on it’s how the law is actually working so before people get on me about how I’m wrong about the legal process in Oregon just make sure you’re sure that you understand how it has been functioning in the last few years. It’s a mess here right now. Good luck OP.
Thank you for your response! The unfortunate thing is that she’s not homeless, which means she’s being neglected. She is in someone’s care on the next street over (not sure where) and the police constantly return her to them without looking in to why she’s out with no clothes on, breaking laws over and over.
My advice which is more on the practical side because in my experience the law is no longer helpful with regards to homeless related issues in Oregon would be to reach out to a local homeless organization and see if they have any services available to help with such a thing. Without knowing your exact location I’m not sure which one to recommend but there are several. They may know who this woman is. They don’t want to see her freezing with her life at risk. Hopefully they can provide some services to her and get her to a safe place.
I’m going to try to reach out anyway like you said because it’s possible I can find more resources that way. Thanks again.
