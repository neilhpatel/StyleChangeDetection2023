I agree they have things that we can't even imagine. I'm just saying the 6th generation will not be ready for 10-15 years. Even if it's done they spent 1 trillion developing the 5th generation they need to sell as many as possible before they release the next.
This is true, but features like Eject, Missile target lock and remote start are now subscriptions based @12,000.00 / Month. God bless the micro transaction.
America is still selling plenty of 4th generation planes, right now. There is a long tail on technology in the export market, because plenty of countries can get by on “good enough” rather than “bleeding edge” for their security needs.
The whole f35 R&D and procurement of just under 2500 planes is going to cost the US 412 billion dollars (in today's money), with 1.3 trillion in operating costs until 2070.
Essentially that included replacing the first fleet of f35s with a second Gen by 2045 ish, and R&D costs along the way.
The government and the press did a miserable job explaining the programme costs from the beginning. The 1 trillion dollar figure was essentially the estimated lifetime cost in year 2000 dollars basically.
