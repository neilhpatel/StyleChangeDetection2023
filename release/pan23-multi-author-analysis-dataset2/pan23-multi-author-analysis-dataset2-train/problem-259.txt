"The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the ADA states that if an employer requires an employee it reasonably believes will pose a "direct threat" to the health and safety of themselves or others to be examined by a health care professional of the employer's choice, then the employer must pay all costs associated with the visit.
In a pandemic, certain employees, such as those reporting to work in an area with a high rate of infection, may pose a direct threat. "Employers could therefore be required to pay for administering employer-mandated COVID-19 tests," she said.".
They probably cannot force you to get a COVID test via an at-home kit. They may be able to require you to get tested every two weeks, but either through their program, or you getting one however you want (such as through a provider).
They can probably be terminated for not getting tested or vaccinated. The bigger question is whether the employer must reimburse this as a work expense like mileage. Contact an AR employment lawyer who knows about wage/hour claims.
