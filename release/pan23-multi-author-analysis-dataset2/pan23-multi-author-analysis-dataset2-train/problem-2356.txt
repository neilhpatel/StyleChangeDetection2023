IANAL but I was in a similar situation. I would definitely at least have a consultation with an injury/accident attorney. I was glad I did because turns out we had same insurance, they dress like certain store employees, and they wanted to argue and drag it out not medical bills. Without my attorney Im not sure what I would have done.
Do you have a case? Absolutely. What is your case worth? Absolutely no way to say right now. Your own PIP insurance is responsible for your medical bills and lost wages, up to your policy limits or two years from the accident, whichever comes first. The other driver’s insurer is responsible for any medical bills/lost wages beyond your PIP coverage, plus pain and suffering. The only way to determine the value of your case is to wait until you have finished treating, then look at your post-PIP medical bills/lost wages and the extent of your injuries and treatment. An attorney who only does personal injury would be in the position then to tell you what the case value is. Call a couple now and go with who you’re most comfortable with. Then if your PIP carrier tries to screw you or your doctor wants to screw you, you’ve got somebody on your side to give you advice. And stay away from chiropractors.
