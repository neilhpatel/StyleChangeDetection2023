You served the complete duration of your sentence plus the 30 days in California? What did your lawyer say when you asked about that?
If that's the case you might speak with an attorney. I wouldn't have tremendous hope for anything here.
Full sentence in Missouri plus the 30 days I didn’t get credit for in California waiting for Missouri to pick me up. Under Missouri’s penal code those 30 days should have been credited. From my understanding the loop hole for the judge to not give me those 30 days would have been to give me a sentence + 30 extra days. They broke their own law basically. According to their penal code from self research in law library.
Lawyer originally said I would be getting times served. The main sherif in Missouri sealing with my case and all out of state cases said I was going to get times served by law. In the moment of being incarcerated she was unreachable. She had my money and an outcome, she no longer wanted to help me.
This was prior to COVID. I was released December 24th 2019. I have waited due to I was still on probation and was scared they would rip my freedom again if I started a lawsuit. No they had 30 days to pick me up. On the 30th day came and got me. Because arrest was due to Missouri compared to If I was arrested and they did a warrant check and let Missouri know. But because I was only arrested due to Missouri I get time served. They agreed on date and then miscommunication they were like fuck it, “we were just taking his word for it.”.
