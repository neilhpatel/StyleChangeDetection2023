You selected courses only for semester 1 and then didn't show up. Them asking you to pay for 8 semesters is absurd.
The fact that you are broke and located outside the USA makes it very hard to the school to collect even if you have a valid claim.
If it's one of the main colleges in the US, they're not very likely to let you go four semesters years without A: paying, or B: signing up for no classes (after the first). Colleges/Universities here usually require payment up front or during the term--certainly not four years later.
This sounds very scammy, possibly like the first semester's debt got sold to a collection agency, who's acting in some very bad ways. (To note: debts can be sold from one agency to the other, sometimes filtering down to bottom-feeding agencies who pull scams.).
> My dad called the college who confirmed the agency are legitimate. They are asking for payment for 8 semesters of courses.
No, the OP says his dad confirmed with the college that they want payment for eight semesters of learnin'.
Maybe this has something to do with you using a "recruiter." Like maybe if you enroll, the school owes a lot of money to the recruiter even if you drop out, and that's why the school is now billing you, because the recruiter is asking them for money.
If the person you emailed was an admissions counselor for that university, when you emailed that you were not coming, they would have put that info into the computer. You'd simply be part of the "summer melt".
No, don't do that. I'm just surprised a college you never went to would be trying to bill you for eight semesters. One semester, sure. Eight is absurd.
If you never showed up, you would have been unenrolled. No way would they hold a place for you for 4 years!
