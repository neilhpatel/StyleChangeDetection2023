I went to school in Russia (2007-2018), and yes, it's nothing new â€“ although we specifically didn't have too much militarism because it was a high-tier gymnasium (basically most of the militarism was related to the victory day/army day, and once they brought us to some event organized by the army where they were trying to recruit kids to join army after school), but it has been a more prominent thing in lower tier public schools for a while now. However, recently it's taken a crazier turn as they've been imposing increasing amounts of militarism onto children. In fact, currently they mandated so called "talks about important" lessons which essentially are just plain propaganda put directly into children's minds, and there were more militaristic events not related to any holidays.
I have a Canadian friend who has children with a Russian woman and he has been sharing pictures of the kids in military like attire including the hats for years. This is nothing new.
You are taking gibberish. Russia under Putler is an evil failed state. They are going bankrupt. No one wants to do business with them. They don't even make anything except 1980s weapons.
