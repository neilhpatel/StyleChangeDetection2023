Edit: what confuses me is that, in Indiana, in order for charges to be filed about something violating the no contact, it should be an order from a judge/court, not from the police.
I see that it’s still unlikely there could’ve been a racial component and it honestly seemed like I was pulling at straws to see if it cohere been racially motivated but there were a few other things like how my supervisors wouldn’t communicate issues to me at times or respond to my emails when I needed help. That’s what makes it complicated.
They offered a few reasons. I do have to take some responsibility for things like how I had difficulty coming to work on time in the mornings and couldn’t complete assignments well. But the particular racial component came from how a white woman misinterpreted my words and complained to my boss that I insulted her. I was reprimanded at work without being given a chance to defend myself.
