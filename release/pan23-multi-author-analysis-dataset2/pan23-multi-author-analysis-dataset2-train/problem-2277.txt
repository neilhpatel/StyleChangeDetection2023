I can't speak to your specific credit union but the two banks I've worked at have tight policies around cashier's checks. Since they are collected funds they may impose a waiting period before allowing it to be reissued. Your receipt/copy of the check might have it disclosed on there. Generally it goes something like, "If this check is lost, destroyed, or stolen we will require a sworn written statement and a 90 day waiting period from the date of issuance prior to replacement". The written statement would likely be a form they have you fill out.
I wish he would let me hand it in in person. He is never available when I am and I have no way of online payments. He doesn't give receipts either which I should start asking for. My bank is columbia credit union so I will call them and try to cancel. Thank you.
First thing is to find out if it has been cashed/deposited. Follow the steps the financial institution lays out to resolve it. Fingers crossed they don't have the waiting period policy.
Before you cancel the check, ask them if it's cleared and if so, provide you with a copy of the front and back of the cancelled check. Give a copy of that to your landlord.
