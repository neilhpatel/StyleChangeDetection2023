Call the attorney’s law firm and ask to speak to them personally. Leave a voice mail message explaining the situation if you cannot reach them personally. Look them up on their firm’s website and send them an email stating they are suing the wrong party. Do not say much more than explain that the names are similar, but different and that they have the wrong party named in the suit.
They may ignore your calls, but will not ignore calls from another attorney. You may even be able to get them to pay your attorney’s fees if that becomes necessary.
If they do not immediately agree to dismiss the suit against your entity and send you proof of that dismissal, or if you do not get in touch with someone at least a week before the answer date, you need to hire an attorney to handle this.
You need to hire an attorney to respond to a multi million dollar lawsuit. Just because you think they are wrong doesn't mean they do and you alone won't convince them.
Be aware that lawyers generally run a few decades behind, so it's likely he'll want to fax the papers to you, or send them by mail.
I just learned that telegrams, the ones that used to be sent by Morse code. Is probably one of the best ways to send an official notice due to the laws on the books. It is same day delivery to business and they guarantee delivery so they will see the message.
You need to either respond (which would mean hiring a lawyer close to the court and having him file a response with the court) or get yourself dismissed from the case.
