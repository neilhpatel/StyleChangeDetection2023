The second opinion said that it very rarely happens. I’m not mad that something was left behind. I get it that things happen. I was more upset at how the original vet office handled my concerns. They just said that it wasn’t possible and tried to get me off the phone.
It's going to be medical specific here. If it's an accepted possibility from being spayed then the vet didn't do anything wrong. They performed a service and are owed payment.
I would not suggest hiring a lawyer like the other user said as that likely would cost more than both the initial and subsequent treatment.
You're only entitled a refund possibly if the vet was negligent/acted outside the standard operating procedure. It'd be no different if the cat didn't respond to anesthesia well and had another procedure that cost $$$$. I'm not a vet, so I can't say any which way. From a quick google it sounds like just something that happens and you're unlucky.
