Covid is actually a very successful virus. What you don’t wanna do is be too lethal. Covid being able to keep the mortality rate down ensured it’s survival.
Very little chance it has 60% mortality. Rates look higher because they’re only testing the dead and (some) known contacts.
For something like this. We will basically be resetting the World. 60 percent mortality rate is horrific. Billions will die.
Even smaller chance it has 60% mortality and manages to be as transmissible human to human as Covid.
If it legit has a 15% mortality rate you won’t have to force people to wear masks or stay home. Something killing that many people will make the vast majority of even the most skeptical anti-vaccine types stay home.
This flu will not have anywhere near 60% mortality, the reason why now it's so high is because we have a handful of cases, and we only test for it when someone dies, and then we check their family members. We don't check thousands of people who probably had it, and got better on their own. The worst we will get is probably comparable to swine flu pandemic of 2009-2010, and most people who lived through it didn't know there was a pandemic going on.
Yes, the yearly flu vaccine is actually a cocktail of vaccines for the most probable emergent flu varieties according to the CDC. There are already H5N1 vaccines and the process for adapting them to a specific strain is well known.
Additionally there are antivirals such as Tamiflu, zanamivir, peramivir, and Baloxavir that work against all flu varieties.
