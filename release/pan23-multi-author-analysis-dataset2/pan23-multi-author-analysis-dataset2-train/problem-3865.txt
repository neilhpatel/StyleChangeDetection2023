You can talk to a lawyer, but it won't go anywhere. Madison PD and the Dane County DA's Office will not charge them with a crime, nor will they issue a citation. Whether you think it's fair or unfair, the narrative here is that you cut a line, got a drink, and then tried to leave with the drink in violation of state law. The fact that you got to the street before they reached you isn't really going to change that enough to make them seem like the bad guys. However, knowing the Dane County DA's Office and the Madison PD and the experiences I've had dealing with them, pushing the issue will almost certainly lead to you being issued a citation for an open container of intoxicants, and it'll likely result in your blacklisting from most of the bars on State St.
I’m from Wisconsin and I just want to say you can’t walk with alcohol in the streets at all. I went to college near Madison and that was a huge thing, never leave with the alcohol. But, they had no right to tackle you like that.
Now, a civil suit against the bouncers and/or the bar? Maybe. But then you'd have to show significant enough damages/injuries to the attorney to justify a suit, and from what you've described I'm just not sure a civil attorney would find enough there to warrant filing (or, at the very least, the cost to you to file would likely exceed the value of the suit itself). But you CAN sue to prove a point, whether you do it pro se or with counsel.
