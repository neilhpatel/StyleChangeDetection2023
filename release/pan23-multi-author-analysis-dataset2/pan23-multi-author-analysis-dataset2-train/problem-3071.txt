Dude, as an ex-NYer, the NYS commission already has a metric shit ton to answer for, no matter what. Cuomo already saw to it that they fucked NYS and all of America for his hypothetical political benefit, even though the guy is probably doing fuck all these days except getting justifiably sued and sexually harassing the female doordash drivers who deliver cheeseburgers to his fucking mansion.
hate to break it to you, NY3 and NY4 both went red, and both were very winnable if the state party had supported the candidates and even attempted to control the narrative. Federal misplays aside, while final totals are still pending both chambers of the New York state legislature are expected to remain in democratic control so gerrymandering isnt an immediate concern.
Republicans haven't had control of the NYS legislature in over a decade. I cant cry about gerrymandering when it comes to the piss poor performance of our candidates in close races in this state. We needed to compete in every race that mattered and at least in New York we failed to do that, and we might lose the house because of it.
