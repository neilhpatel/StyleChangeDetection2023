But that's how every international justice system/international law works - domestic adoption by every single signatory. Even the ICC has no jurisdiction a) if a country has not ratified the Rome Statute, or b) if a country tries the case itself. When the US didn't like the outcome of an ICJ case the US simply quit and nobody could do anything about it. International law is just domestic law by international consensus (or pressure for smaller/weaker countries).
The actual report just argues that each member should consider it and that the UN could help draw up frameworks that could inform and assist them in the process.
Isn't the first country you'd think of being strongly opposed to international justice systems the US? While it is indeed absurd to expect a country lead by psychopaths put the thumb screwsbone saw to one of their most important revenue streams, a country whose corporations have funded coups and wars across several continents without facing any consequences is hardly worth not mentioning at all.
It sounds as though the above user was specifically highlighting the scenario in which fossil fuel extraction or use is largely done by the state, rendering laws regarding corporate responsibility moot.
The US doesn't really have state owned anything making it a pretty good example of where laws like this could work... if their legislature weren't so corrupt that they would never actually pass said laws.
