Even at work? The employee in question. Set up audio recording on her phone and then walked off without telling. Came back and later told another coworker that she was trying to catch people talking about her so “play nice”. The whole situation just makes me feel creeped out and my privacy doesn’t seem respected.
One-party consent (Which SC is one of the states that uses this for privacy law) means that at least one party in the recording needs to consent. Usually, this means that the person recording is free to do so, because obviously they're consenting. However, by walking off she isn't a party so no one consents, so it is probably illegal.
I think the main thing this would hinge on is whether you had a reasonable expectation of privacy when she was recording you. If you were upfront where customers would/could be present, the answer is likely no. If you're in an employee-only section, I'd lean towards yes but NAL, grey area for me.
Even at work. There is an exception when the recorded person(s) is in an environment with no reasonable expectation of privacy. (SC Code Ann. § 17-30-20).
