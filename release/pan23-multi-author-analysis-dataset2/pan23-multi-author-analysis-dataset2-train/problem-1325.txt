Second, I have disliked Trump from day one but reading these transcripts makes it crystal clear that we are dealing with not just a narcissist who is serving his own ego at all times, but a deeply corrupt mob boss who employs only completely loyal slimebags. I mean from the top down just dirty, zero scruples, phony, not a moral in sight dirtbags. I feel sorry for the people at the bottom like Cassidy who are naive and just trying to forge a career and be a normal 20 something year old.
