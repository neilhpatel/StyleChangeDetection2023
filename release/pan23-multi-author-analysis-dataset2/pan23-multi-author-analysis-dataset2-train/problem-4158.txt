We don't have grounds to get some kind of custody after 8 years of unaided raising? There is a history of abuse and we've gone to cps before. Even with what little time they've spent with their parents they've come back dirty hungry and occasionally bruised. CPS has written it off. Once by a girl we later found out was drinking buddies with the dad and the second time because the father accused the older brother (6 at the time.) of sexually assaulting his sister(4). We were told that because nothing was broken that "superseded" the abuse allegation.
What do you mean by "in a fit of rage my sister gave 50/50 custody to the dad"? Custody arrangement are a relatively involved court procedure; it's not something you just give away in the heat of the moment. Did all of this actually happen through the courts? If so, did your mother have a lawyer?
-I meant as backlash for mom persuing custody and otherwise completely out of the blue. We had a court date with the father which we assumed would be him pushing for custody somehow but she surprised us. I assume she's been working out the custody agreements with him secretly over this past month.
-Mom did have a lawyer who advised her to dismiss the case for custody once the father showed up and got involved because he said it would give him a platform to get custody he didn't have otherwise as he wasn't listed on the birth certificate. The lawyer was a family friend and it all went rather poorly.
