The person who took the picture isn’t in trouble, the picture was taken in a parking lot where there’s no privacy and nothing illegal has happened here yet. Your friend was sleeping in his work truck. His employer has a right to investigate that. There is probably a little more to the story here.
However, it sounds like something more is going on here. Just from a common sense perspective, if your friend is a good employee, and he really did just take a nap and clock in on time, and he really is that vital - why on earth would they suspend him? Like you said, they're shooting themselves in the foot. Most of the time people don't do that on purpose.
I'm also curious about your last line. At no point in the rest of the story did it seem like the location of his phone was at all important. Is he not allowed to have his phone on the property or something? Why does it matter if it's on him or next to him? I'm assuming it does matter since you ended with it, but I can't see how.
It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post. Please update the body of your original post to include this information.
