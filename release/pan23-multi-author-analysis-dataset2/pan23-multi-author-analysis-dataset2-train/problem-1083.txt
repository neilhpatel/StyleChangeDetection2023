No major hotel chain (or any other business owned by someone with a brain) is going to allow employees to make personal deals that affect their clients and/or business in this manner. If caught she can expect to be terminated. Claiming ignorance because it "wasn't in the paperwork" is extremely unlikely to change this.
to be completely honest, I couldn't give a shit if she got fired for this, .... Except that the plural amount of 16ish hour shifts a week were really wearing me down, so I'd love for her to not get fired.
That said, now that I know about the thing (and you addressed it as if it were me), I am a HELL of a lot more invested in not going down with her ship. I don't have a risk-worthy amount of faith that my text message records telling her not to do the thing would be sufficient in the face of failing to bring this up to management before it gets real.
It's not illegal to recommend a restaurant to a guest and it's not illegal to receive something from a restaurant in return for doing so. That said, if the owner/GM finds out about this arrangement you may end up pulling doubles.
That being said, if your GM/owner has no written rules, but you are part of a chain, get a copy of the policies from corporate so you have at least that to reference.
If she is offering her personal recommendation to a restaurant, and that restaurant "tips" her, there isn't anything wrong with it unless it is against corporate policy.
I worked in hospitality for many years in various front office roles, and we regularly gave local recommendations to businesses that would express their appreciation with discounts and the like.
