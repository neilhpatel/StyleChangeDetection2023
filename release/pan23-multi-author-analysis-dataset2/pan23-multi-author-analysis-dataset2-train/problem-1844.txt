I dunno man. I think if Russia really wanted to obliterate Ukraine it would have no trouble doing so. Maybe the threat of NATO keeping them in check? Or maybe they're all in on it? After all war is a profitable business for those in power...
I guess that war would last 2 seconds and end with nuclear apocalypse? It’s not even trash talk, it’s just pure observation: Russia clearly can’t handle Ukraine on its own, what makes anyone think they could handle additional conflicts? This kind of bluster is stupid and pointless. Even as a propaganda talking point (which is all it could possibly be) who are they fooling? Even their own people living in a tiny 1984 bubble of controlled information must be looking around, thinking to themselves: “hmmm all the young people are being conscripted and not coming home, there are crazy food shortages and local services are worse than ever… this is not good!” As if more war could solve that?
Yeah, they're obviously losing ground and thousands upon thousands of troops on purpose. They haven't been able to secure their supply lines on purpose. It's all 4-dimensional chess.
