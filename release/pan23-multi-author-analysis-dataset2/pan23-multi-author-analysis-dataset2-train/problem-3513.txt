If you're not already completely supporting yourself, emancipation will not be an option. It's not a tool used to get a drivers license.
The likely hood of being emancipated is almost zero. It requires you to be fully self sufficient, needing to be able to pay rent, utilities, for food, etc. while also attending school with no outside help. Having somewhere also to stay like a friend or relatives is not sufficient.
The answer to those two questions may be state-specific. Usually, emancipation does not affect things with age restrictions, such as driving, school attendance, voting, alcohol, firearms, etc. However, if you are emancipated, you can apply for a drivers license without a parent’s signature. You would still be subject to your state’s labor laws for minors, but you would not need a parent’s signature to get a work permit.
The purpose of emancipation to give already independent minors some of the rights of adults, especially for finances. In general, the requirements for emancipation are:
That isn't how emancipation works. You need to have a job with an income high enough to support yourself before emancipation, not after.
You are already living apart from your parents or guardian. Some states say that your parents must have given you permission to live away, or at least that they aren't actively trying to make you return. A few states are OK if you can show fixed plans for living independently, even if you are still at home.
Some state require that your parents consent to emancipation, or at least don't file an objection. Some will allow emancipation even if the parents object, if it can be shown it's in the minor's best interests.
You must show that you are good at handling your own affairs. You are currently managing all your own finances. No overdrawn accounts or late bills. You keep good records. Good school grades. No criminal record. No traffic tickets.
