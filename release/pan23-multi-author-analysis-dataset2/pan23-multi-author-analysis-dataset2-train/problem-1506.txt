Building permits and local codes are fairly easy to follow, especially on rural property. Your biggest concern with buying property should be whether you can get utilities to the site, and if you're in a flood plain.
Perk test, contact local well company, distance from nearest utility pole, and FEMA flood assessment are the big determinants on the viability of a property. After that it's a matter of how much money do you want to spend. Want to dig a basement but have a high water table? Get your checkbook. Gotta blast through rock for the foundation? Oh you better believe that ain't cheap. Need gravel or fill to mitigate a drainage issue? Dirt's cheap, moving it is expensive.
What state are you looking to purchase in? You can look on Zillow for that area, for unimproved land for sale. The listings will also often mention if it has nearby electric to tap into, a water source or well, the county it's in. If you like what you see and want to move forward, call the count's Town/City hall and ask if there are any restrictions to building, living in a camper while you build, and contacts they might have (if you decide to get a septic system) to getting a perk test done.
Buying unimproved land is actually pretty easy and straight forward, just make sure to check on easements and neighboring properties so you don't find you're dream landed surrounded by the wrong folks.
