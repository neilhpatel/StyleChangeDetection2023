I dunno, I'm happy with the recent election results and the specific example from the article was surprising when it happened.
Regardless of whether we can blame it on gerrymandering or right wing propaganda, these people, continue to win elections.
Our recent successes in 2020 and 2022 were the result of Democrats being the angriest and most motivated I've ever seen them in my 50-sometthing years, and the results are that we still need to rely on R support to get anything passed in the House, and still have 2 extra Rs in the senate named Manchin and Sinema -.
Telling everyone we're all good now, and that we've permanently beaten the MAGAs, with the supreme court in the state it's in and 2 R in D clothing in the Senate, and the house under R control does not set us up for continued success, IMO.
