Russia is repeating its history during the time when the Russia king insisted on fighting a losing war despite the country was in economic despair,It seems like what comes around goes around. Karma's a bitch ,those who took the lives of innocent Ukrainians and sending his unwilling russian man and youth to die for him/them will someday receive their retribution. What ever evil deeds they have done will "haunt" them.
Lol they have been slaughtering any leaders they get inside a gun sight. Any until someone competent removes Putin from power in theater leadership is a moot point. Even a competent leader has to deal with Russian leadership above and toxic morale below while suffering from 3rd world supply chain providing 3rd world supply. Russian is sourcing NKorean arms at this point.
It really sucks: Russia killing Ukrainian leaders causes problems, but Ukraine killing Russian leaders runs the risk of someone competent ending up in charge, so Ukraine has to weigh the risk of any response.
