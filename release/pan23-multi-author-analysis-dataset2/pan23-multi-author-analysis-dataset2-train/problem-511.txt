A lease is a legally binding contract. Since you are still on the lease, you are legally responsible for it.
Since your GF is on the lease as well, she has the authority to change the locks. Now, since you are on the lease they have to give you a set of the new keys if you ask. They can not refuse them to you or access to your dwelling. If they did? Then you got a case.
A protection order requires you to be legally served (usually by a police officer) for the order to take effect. If you're not served, it's not enforceable. Never happened.
There isn't a spot for the landlord to sign on the release of leaseholder. I'm doing OK for myself these days. I may just suck it up and pay it and worry about handling the rest later.
Thanks for the reply. This makes a lot of sense. I can pay it, but I feel as though I'd be paying for someone else's mistakes. A contracts a contract, but I wish they'd at least split it up so we'd both have to pay for the consequences.
Well, you signed the lease and assumed legal responsibility of said lease. You're paying for your mistakes.
If you are still on the lease you may need to pay it and sue her in small claims court for the balance.
Unless the lease specifically said each party is responsible for a specific percent of said lease, any single party is responsible for the entire thing.
Did the landlord sign off on you being removed from the lease? Everyone needs to sign and agree to it. If all parties signed that sheet, you do not owe anything.
