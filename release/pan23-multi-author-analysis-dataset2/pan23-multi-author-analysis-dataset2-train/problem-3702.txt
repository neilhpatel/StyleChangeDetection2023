Your post here has been reported as a potential troll or falsified post. Please message the moderators through the link below with proof of some kind that this isn't a troll post.

Your comments state that you are 19, so your legal recourse here is to move out if you don't like your father's rules.
At 19, your father has no obligation to house you, but would need to actually file for an eviction after a notice to vacate to remove you as you are a tenant. If you have been kicked out without an eviction, you could (potentially) pursue a lawsuit against your father for an illegal eviction.
When we're minors and living under our parent's house, we live by their rules. It sucks, but there's really no option that you're going to get what you want out of this. You can't be emancipated just on the fact that you want to play video games. If you somehow did get emanicipated you may not even be able to afford to play the game because you'll be having to go to school and support yourself. So, even if you can afford it, you might not have time to do it.
Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or youâ€™ve edited your post to comply with the rules, . Do not make a second post or comment.
From a practical and realistic standpoint, you need to strike a balance with your game playing and what your father expects from you.
Your father's actions likely don't rise to the level CPS intervention because they don't get into the weeds of what they believe is best parenting techniques, just that you are getting your basic needs taken care of and that your family isn't doing any substantive harm to you. Even if they did remove you, there's no guarantee the place they put you is going to even give you a way to play the game you want to.
