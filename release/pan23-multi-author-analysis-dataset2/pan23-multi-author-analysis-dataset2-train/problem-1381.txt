This all feels like a prelude to the GOP’s redefined ultimate goal: a single ruling party system under the rebranded God’s Omnipresent Power party. No dissension or opposition parties allowed. What the former guy began by publicly declaring the press The Enemy of the People, which is the phrasing favored by despots over the past century (and even Nixon knew better than utter them in front of a mic), will be accomplished by DeSantos et al.
Just look at the lies his defenders are spreading in this very post, and then keep in mind that literally tens of millions of dollars were devoted to spreading those lies everywhere.

By December we'll know the results in AZ and NV. Currently AZ seems like a lock. AZ hasn't been called yet out of respect for the process. If Democrats win AZ & NV Democrats win the Senate. That lowers the stakes in GA. Without the Senate hanging in the balance I doubt Republicans show up for Walker. The runoff will go to Warnock by double digits.
Warnock once got into an argument with his wife where his wife accused him of running over her foot. She was completely uninjured.
