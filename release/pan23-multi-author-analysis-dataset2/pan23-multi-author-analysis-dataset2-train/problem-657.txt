Employers have methods for recouping over paid wages, but I don't believe that they can reverse a deposit like that. OP certainly can't just keep the money, though.
There is no chance you would be entitled to the money: they would win a lawsuit to force repayment. The only question is what steps the employer has to do to reclaim the money.
I found an (see page 15-18) regarding the California's government payment rules, which indicate they allow reversal within 2 days of payment posting. Naturally, the government may not be restricted by the same laws as private businesses, but I cannot find anything that indicates reversing an overpayment is illegal in California, beyond federal law that restricts it to 5 days.
They cannot deduct an overpayment from a later paycheck without specific written authorization of the employee, however. They cannot deduct it from a final paycheck even with authorization. Instead, if the employee refuses to refund the company, the company would need to sue the employee to force repayment.
