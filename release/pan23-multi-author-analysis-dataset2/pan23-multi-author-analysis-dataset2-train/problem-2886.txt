If I remember right Taiwan only has 3 places ships can actually land. Not only that but China doesn’t have the ships to move their army so they’d have to take civilian ships to make it work. If people thought the sanctions that destroyed russias economy were bad wait till they see what happens to China. They export A TON of things and if every country that sides with America and Taiwan chooses to stop trade they will be screwed. Especially if america pulls companies out of China and brings them back to America. I don’t think China is dumb enough to actually attack them though, I think they’re hoping to scare them into joining China but it won’t happen.
It isn't a matter if they are dumb enough, but if the politicians in charge are desperate enough. Between the increasing COVID disaster and their flagging economy, the need for a distraction increases exponentially. It's a fatal flaw in all authoritarian governments.
To that end, it may even come down to those staying in power using Taiwan in a nationalistic propaganda push to keep themselves in power. Sending hundreds, if not millions to their death to purge those most opposed to their power and getting everyone else to go along with it in the name of "protecting" China.
Under those conditions, it would be extremely illogical not to attack Taiwan as it would mean they might have to eventually give up power and/or face an internal civil war which, on the whole, would cost many, many more Chinese lives, loss of wealth and prosperity.
I definitely understand the sentiment, however, we don’t have the workforce to replace those jobs sent to China. There are advertisements everywhere for jobs for unskilled laborers. There’s just not enough Americans who are interested in doing those jobs. The likely outcome of repatriating those jobs is extreme inflation to pay for the more expensive labor. Possibly (probably?) a shortage in many products. Unemployment in the US remains very low despite the economic downturn.
