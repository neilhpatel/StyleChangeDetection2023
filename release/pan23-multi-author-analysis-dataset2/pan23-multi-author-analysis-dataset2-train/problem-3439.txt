Thanks for replying! We used to pay through the online portal when there wasn’t a balance. The assistant property manager asked us to pay in person with money orders until it was fixed. I have all receipts, I’ve never thrown any away.
It sounds like you have proof of payment. I can't tell from your post whether you shared it with current property management staff. And I can't tell what the letter is you found on your door. An eviction starts with a notice to quit, which states you have a certain number of days to pay your delinquent rent (number of days is defined by state law). If you don't the landlord can file for an eviction hearing. If it's a notice to quit, you can send a certified letter stating you don't owe anything, and a summary of what you've tried, when, how, and with whom to resolve this, and include your proof of payment and ask that they respond to acknowledge you owe nothing. If they proceed, present your evidence at the eviction hearing (you'd receive notice of the date/time if they proceed with eviction). If the letter is anything other than a notice to quit I'd still send a certified letter. You may want to consult with an attorney if you can't get this resolved before the notice to quit deadline.
