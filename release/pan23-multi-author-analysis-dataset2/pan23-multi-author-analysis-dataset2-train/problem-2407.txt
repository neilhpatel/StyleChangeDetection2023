Mainstream Republicans are afraid of Trump's voters which are their voters also. This became apparent right after January 6th when none of them came out publicly against Trump because they realized very quickly that the voters didn't care that their own invaded the capital and killed people. McConnell made a miscalculation. He has stated that he thought that Trump was done after January 6th and that everyone would reject him. This is why he did not vote to remove him from office. It would damage the party too much. He was wrong. The voters didn't care. Now if they don't let Trump win the nomination, Trump will start his own party and Republicans will lose everything in 2024.
All this talk of Republicans breaking with Trump is just the same acknowledgement of the hold he has over the GOP, a tacit admission that Trump remains the most powerful force in conservative politics.
It is also a tacit acknowledgment that the crazies cannot leave the GOP cause they will not win statewide (or Prez) elections with support from moderate Republicans only.
