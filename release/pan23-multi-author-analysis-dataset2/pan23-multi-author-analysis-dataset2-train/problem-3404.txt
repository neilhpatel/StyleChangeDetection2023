I wasn't referring to start and end times (I'm salaried and have those too); it's about being micromanaged to the point of not being able to schedule your own meal and bathroom breaks.
If you're fired for taking a bathroom break go see a lawyer about a public policy wrongful termination lawsuit. If you have to use the bathroom, go to the bathroom. Don't ask, just go. If you get crap about it ask your boss if he would prefer you piss your pants. NY does require a meal break if you work 6 hours or more but that might not apply to exempt employees, I'm not 100% sure.
I’m an audiologist, so I see patients all day. I have an hour scheduled for lunch, but patient appointments often go over the allotted times, our boss allows people to walk in and drop off hearing aids for cleanings/repairs and I’m expected to work on them whenever I can in between (there’s no set time to do this), and if people are late to their appointments, I’m still expected to see them, which has a domino effect on the schedule for the rest of the day. Technically I could use the bathroom between patients, but when I’m already 20 minutes late for the next person who is angrily waiting in the waiting room and I still have to sanitize my office (COVID), wash my hands and change my gloves, I feel like I just don’t have the time.
