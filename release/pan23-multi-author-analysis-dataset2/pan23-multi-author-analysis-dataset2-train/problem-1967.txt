Note that if you do not pay TPT (sales tax) you should instead pay a AZ Use tax on that purchase. both of these are 5.6%. So you could tell them that you will review the transaction and pay the appropriate AZ use tax.
You’re not really paying them. They’re required to collect tax on your behalf. You’re paying the state of az. You are required to pay sales tax either at time of purchase or at the end of the year during your state tax returns (usually for online purchases that aren’t taxed).
The amount they are saying I owe does not match the 5.6% for AZ tax though. It's roughly $20 more they are asking for. The purchase was $999. I have never encountered anything like this before so I just feel lost on it. I will pay if its needed however, I definitely don't want to pay more than I am supposed to. Even if its only $20 bucks.
Oh thank you for that. Would you know what might happen if I don't pay it? I feel like waiting a full year to tell me "oh by the way you owe us $78 bucks" is so strange.
