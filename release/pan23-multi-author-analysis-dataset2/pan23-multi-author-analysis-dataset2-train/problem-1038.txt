I didn’t realize it was as common as it is. I have had 3 previous jobs and never had this experience. Granted those jobs were with smaller companies. It’s an issue that needs to be fixed. This situation is not possible for me. I routinely have meetings for my research projects after work that I either miss or have to come late too. I am at risk for loosing grants for my research because my hours are so unreliable at work that I am late at least once a week. If working was the only thing I did it would probably be okay but I’m a full time student and am the lead on 2 research projects. When my life is scheduled down to 2 minutes for a bathroom break, I can’t afford to have my schedule messed with by Dunkin Donuts. That’s why I say I will find employment elsewhere.
So theoretically they could keep us all day? At what point does it become an issue. The only legal thing I could think of is that if we leave at the end of our shift if they didn’t dismiss us then we get written up and if you are written up 3 time you get fired. So we can get fired for leaving at the end of our shift. Also isn’t it required that employees get a break? How is it legal to keep us the required amount of hours but not give us a break. I believe you I just want to understand why. Like what do unions and workers rights cover if it’s not this.
Yes, they can keep you all day. They can fire you for refusing to stay and do the work that they want you to do.
