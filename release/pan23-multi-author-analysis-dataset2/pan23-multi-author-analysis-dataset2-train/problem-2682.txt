it will depend on the crime. generally from crimes committed under 18, you would be charged as a minor, then the state can bind you over to the adult system if the crime allows it.
Turning 18 doesn't matter. If your jurisdiction allows for someone your age at the time of the crime to be charged as an adult for that crime, they can do that. Waiting doesn't help.
No. The charging decision will be based on your age at the time of the alleged crime, and the seriousness of the crime.
If you were going to be charged as an adult, you would probably already know about it, because only very serious crimes committed by minors are elevated to adult court. While the court could in theory refer a drug possession felony by a 17-year-old to adult court, in practice they don't do that for nonviolent crimes.
Presumably these are felony drug charges related to your enthusiastic consumption of an assortment of schedule 1 and 2 narcotics. While Ohio juvenile courts can actually extend their jurisdiction over you until you turn 21, the most likely outcome is that you'll get probation and have it transferred to the adult probation department.
