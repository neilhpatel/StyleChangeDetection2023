If someone who has a documented history of mental illness and is in treatment for it is taking advantage of the system then who is the system for? I paid my copay for the doctor but I didn’t pay for the paperwork.
Because you used the term "registered" - there is no ESA registry, and any site or "doctor" offering that is scamming you. If you bought this paperwork, then you do not, in fact, have an ESA and your dog is there in violation of your landlord's no-pet policy.
Where did you get this ESA paperwork? Did you get it from a doctor who is currently treating you for the condition or disability that he is prescribed to alleviate?
Yes it’s my actual doctor. He’s not the doctor that originally approved me because I moved across the state two months ago and found a new doctor to keep prescribing me my anti depressants and found a new therapist. So I didn’t want to say they were the ones treating me the ENTIRE time because I just moved.
That's not quite what I asked. Did you find this person online and pay them for this paperwork? Or is it your actual doctor who's actually and actively treating you?
