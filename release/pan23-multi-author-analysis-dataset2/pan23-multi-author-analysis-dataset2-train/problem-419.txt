You can only withhold or escrow rent if the condition of the unit "materially affects the health or safety of the tenant or substantially affects the use and occupancy of the premises." This does not qualify.
Wouldn't that be a retaliatory eviction? We're literally unable to enjoy our unit because our landlord ISN'T doing anything about our neighbors noise.
Okay so my dad has severe COPD, he takes multiple meds for anxiety and depression - the noise from these neighbors is so bad it keeps him awake and he's literally starting to weaken.
You also have to keep in mind, in the current Covid climate, your landlord may not even be able to evict your neighbors right now, even if he wants to. You should continue to complain about the noise, but that's about the extent of your options at this point.
I'm at a loss of what to do then at this point. I have made so many complaints, always attached with proof - at least 20 to 30 emails. Nothing is being done, nothing has changed. I guess my only option is to move, but damn we're in a situation where nothing is going to happen even IF we signed a lease that has a huge noise thing in it... I guess fight fire with fire then, we're just going to start to make a bunch of noise in the morning if they do it at night, I don't know what else to do.
