I mean, I’m not a lawyer so maybe you could get more than half if you go to court, but generally speaking I try to avoid involving the court whenever possible. If she refuses to pay half, you could always say “Either pay half or I’ll take you to court and ask for all of it,” as a way of encouraging her to take the deal vs risk having to pay even more. Best next step is just being rid of your ex, I’d imagine, and working it out between yourselves is likely the fastest and easiest way to do that, if u can make it work.
IANAL, I find your calculations hard to follow but generally speaking I think she should pay half of all costs (or whatever percentage she was paying prior to the breakup). I don’t think it matters who ended it or who cheated or any of that. You both entered into a lease together and now you are both exiting that lease. That’s pretty much the long and short of it. If she’s unwilling to pay her share, then get receipts when you pay and save a copy of your lease, so you have them to show in court.
It has to be after you pay the bills in full, yes. Right now there's nothing to sue her for, correct? And it will take time to go through the court process and collect. The post is sort of confusing, but she will owe you $1043.80 if she fails to pay you $1043.80 before it's due but "It won't all be due for a little bit though." You could start the process now if you want but why not wait and see if she pays?
