Is anyone else annoyed how the definition of mass shooting keeps getting looser and looser, and fringe shootings like this are being lumped into the same category as sandy hook?
Fringe shootings? A 6 year old with a gun and your problem is the definition? It is a gun problem. Sandy Hook was a problem with guns and a six year old with a gun is part of the same problem. By trying to classify it differently you attempt to muddy water and make it seem like a non issue.
