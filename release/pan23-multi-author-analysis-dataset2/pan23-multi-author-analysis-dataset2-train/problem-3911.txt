What is your state? Unless a contract is subject to the Statute of Frauds (and exactly what contracts are varies by state, which is why that's required) a verbal contract is absolutely enforceable.
The problem is when you try to prove that the contract exists, or what its terms were, it's much more difficult when it's not written down. So you are right, your contracts should be in writing with the specifics laid out, but you're kind of right for the wrong reason.
As a general matter, that isn't true. While certain contracts (like the sale of real property) must be in writing, most garden-variety ones do not. A verbal contract, if it meets all the other requirements of a contract, is still a contract.
Btw, it's worth hiring a lawyer to develop a fill-in-the-blanks contract for your particular business.
I always heard that verbal was seen as a "He said, she said" in court, and normally doesn't help anyone when you have to take someone to court over breach of contract.
But difficulty of proof does not make something void as a matter of law, or as you put it, that it "holds no legal weight." That just isn't correct.
Here, you're already doing work, right? So assuming you aren't crazy people who just showed up and started doing this work, it's reasonable to infer that some contract exists. It's just the difficulty of proving what the terms were, which is what your dispute is over here.
Should you have written contracts? As I said, yes, you should. But not because all oral contracts are invalid. They aren't.
Think about this for a moment. Some rape cases are he said, she said and people are in prison because the jury believed one party over another. Fundamentally, issues of credibility are for the trier of fact and triers of fact make credibility determinations all the time. So it is wrong to say a verbal contract "doesn't help anyone". It helps whoever the judge chooses to believe.
