But I'm sure that those rules were on the paperwork you signed when you enrolled in the institution. No one is saying that it's wrong for military academies to lock students down, I'm talking about schools where this was never agreed upon by both parties.
It feels pretty unfair that a school already costing students so much can also mandate that they MUST live in the dorms whilst simultaneously saying that they MUST stay there without any chance to leave.
Generally these contracts stipulate, not in this plain of language but, "student follows all rules, old and new, or risks discipline up to and including expulsion." And the students sign this, and then they make a new rule. The student signs that they have agreed to all rules, old and new. If a new rule was illegal ("rob jewelry stores every Tuesday or be evicted") then there would be a legal case, obviously.
