New Hampshire have a Labor Board or Department of Labor? Would your previous employer they contacted make a report? It seems as if what they are doing should be illegal. I would keep it off social media who your new employer is until this is straightened out. Regardless of anything else, they shouldnâ€™t be contacting other employers to say anything.
Warn your new employer, that your old employer is being vindictive toward you. And request that they record any and all communications from your old employer, in case you need to sue for defamation (in case your new employer resends their employment offer, based on the information provided by your old employer).
Meanwhile, appliy for unemployment insurance for the time your out of work. They fired you so you should qualify for it.
NAL but I know in the state of Indiana, you're only allowed to state that yes, this person worked here and this is what they made while working here. I don't know how it works in other states, but I would think it would be the same because it seems like an Equal Employment Opportunity violation to just trash a former (or present) worker to another interested employer.
Edit: I would call the Labor Board of NH to report this immediately, because now that I think about it, if they're doing that to you and they're telling flat-out lies, it's either slander or libel, they're trying to make sure you don't make any money or work by spreading BS about you.
To be clear, if, in fact, the statements are untrue, and there are damages, those are the two major components to a defamation claim. I'm not sure there is something specific to employment law to push.
Do you have a law source for this? It is my understanding that, while this is the policy at most businesses out of a desire not to be liable for defamation, that in most places there is no actual law specifying this.
