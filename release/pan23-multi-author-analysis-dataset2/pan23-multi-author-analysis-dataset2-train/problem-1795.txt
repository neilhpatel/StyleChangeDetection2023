Since seeing that trans woman porn show up on Alex Jone's phone in his show I'm becoming more convinced the majority of transphobia is conservatives coping with the idea that trans people can be kinda hot.
It took me almost 3 years from beginning to end and even that was only because I was actively transitioning already so I got to skip the first part of the waiting period that requires you to be living as your identified gender for a year and typically be on hormones for a year, barring medical reasons, before they'll even start looking at you as serious.
The closest kids get to surgery as actual minors below the age of full medical consent is a mastectomy for FTM trans which still has the same checks in place and waiting years but doctors are more willing to pull the trigger on it before 17-18 with parental consent being enough, along with all those signatures from child mental health professionals, because it's largely cosmetic, outside of the mental effects on the trans boy, except for removing ability to breastfeed.
