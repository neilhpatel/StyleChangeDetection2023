I also thought I’d stay for the entire two years but it was so toxic and horrible. Everyone only stayed because of the repayment since everyone was made to relocate. I feel like they do this intentionally it’s so messed up. They had the same position available in my home town but said they could only give me the position across the country. Even when I was considering leaving and asked what that’d look like they refused to tell me repayment terms and only said they’d discuss it if the time comes. So there was no way for me to prepare for resignation financially.
That seems so bizarre to me that they’re allowed to give me a time limit as to when to pay it back. It was never mentioned and I assumed I could just pay it back as I’m able. I can barely afford $50/m back. Feels like a form of slavery to force people to stay with them honestly cause it was an extremely toxic workplace.
You signed an agreement to work for them for a year in exchange for money, you are in violation of that contract. Why would they allow you to hold that cash indefinitely?
