Should not having evidence of an effect be the standard here? Would it be better to remove testing and produce the needed evidence that testing does have an effect, possibly infecting more people in the process? I don’t know why an outright travel ban isn’t being instituted.
No evidence tests on travellers would have any effect…. Then why the hell was everyone testing on every flight for almost 2 years? What was the point of any of it?
Got covid for the first time at cristmas. The varient Infected everyone that was there including people who had had it recently and people who just popped their head in for 5 minutes. and caused false negatives on covid tests. Which is why our entire family got it.
The Guardian is hilarious. Last week they were moaning that unlike some EU countries the UK government weren't doing enough to check for Covid on flights from China, now the government has said it'll be requiring those tests they're now reporting that "no evidence tests on travelers (sic) would have any effect".
