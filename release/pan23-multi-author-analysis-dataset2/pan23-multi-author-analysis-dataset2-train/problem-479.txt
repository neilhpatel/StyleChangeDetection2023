Just looking for the main difference in shared and full custody. Both have been in therapy since they were 5/6 ish. They’re 9 & 11 now. We’ve been divorced since early 2015.
It seems like my actual divorce lawyer may have snuck in full custody without us realizing, then. I’ve read through a few times and it mostly says that he needs my permission to do just about anything, including haircuts, but not saying that I as the custodial parent need permission.
Going to try for full custody. She said that for the judge to agree to supervised, there’d have to be physical abuse involved (to my knowledge there hasn’t been since our boys were toddlers).
This is a discussion with your lawyer. Do you currently have shared custody? What is the share of overnights for each parent?
The current ordered visitation is every other weekend and 1 overnight a week. She said it very the phone it would be the same for full custody. She’d also said that we can request less time.
Honestly, I’ve tried to reach out to their father. He ignores everything I say or agrees then his actions are completely opposite. I’ve always allowed him more time within reason, including my weekends, as well.
Likely your better approach here is to seek to address the disparagement than to try to rip these children from their limited time with their father or insert supervision.
He was very mentally and emotionally abusive to me during our relationship. Like it’s so sad to say that I couldn’t get through the first few scenes of maid without a ton of memories flooding back. I’ve been in therapy myself, too.
