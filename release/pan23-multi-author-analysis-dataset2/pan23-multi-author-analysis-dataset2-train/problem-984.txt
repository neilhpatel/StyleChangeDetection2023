Everyone in the comments acting like this is a bad thing, and criticizing him for being discriminating.
Shouldn't we take his comment on face value, as a win for the LGBT community in Israel? Or are these just palestine-related dismissals of netanyahu?
The criticism is not him saying that. It’s putting those people in power despite knowing they held these views then trying to appeal to lefter voters by criticizing it. If he really cared about the issue and LGBTQ rights he wouldn’t have put them in power.
“Struck said in an interview on Sunday with Kan public radio that “so long as there are enough other doctors to provide care,” religious healthcare providers should be able refuse to treat LGBTQ patients.
“JERUSALEM (AP) — Designated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a rare rebuke of his new coalition allies on Sunday for saying they would advance laws allowing discrimination against LGBTQ people, pledging there would be no harm to their rights by his upcoming government.
Netanyahu is set to form the most ultranationalist and religious government in Israel’s history between his Likud movement and several openly anti-LGBTQ parties. This has raised fears among Israel’s LGBTQ community that the new government, expected to take office in the coming week, will roll back gains they have made in recent years.”.
Netanyahu - guys…. We don’t say these things. These things are supposed to be the quiet part. Exposing them to light shows them as the weakness they are. You’re ruining us.
