We, the collective "West," were just a bunch of people minding our own business, arguing politics, far more concerned with our own internal affairs than global geopolitics.
Then you, you megalomaniacal swine, invaded a peaceful, sovereign nation, that had been similarly minding its own business.
Now, congratulations Thanks to you, the entire sane world is united against you and your imperialistic, expansionist agenda.
Translation from Russian; Unlike Russians their governments have stopped backing the private lynching of homosexuals.
Official stance in Russia is they don't have gays over there. And in Russian, pederast has always just been used like the F word in English.
I saw a Norwegian soldier take the buss from Norway to Russia on youtube once. That might be it?? It was like 20 years ago and he was going to help Russia recycle and dismantle old nuclear submarines in Murmansk since the Russians was to poor to do it themselves.
Pretty sure you know it's all the time about the sphere of influence that Russia painted for itself after fall of the Soviet Union. In their eyes no countries that once were trapped within the Eastern bloc should side with any other alliance or country that's being consider as an enemy by Kremlin.
They do not see Ukrainians as an independent nation, they want to control whole eastern Europe - especially Slavic countries. And the justification often is that they managed to rule these countries or nations in the past so it's completely fine to "liberate" these places again. Espionage, creating variety of "democratic" movements or organizations, directly influencing supportive politicians - that's their way.
