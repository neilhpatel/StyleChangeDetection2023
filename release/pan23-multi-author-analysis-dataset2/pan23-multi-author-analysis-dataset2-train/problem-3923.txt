Check if she has an unlimited data plan. That’s a lot of devices, if she doesn’t it would be easy to incur massive overages very quickly. Switching to one would definitely be a lot cheaper if she is getting $2,000 bills.
Definitely read and reread the bill, the plan, the usage, the device charges, etc. everything is supposed to match up. It will be good for all of you to check it to learn how companies bill for things. AT&T should also be able to explain where the excess is being charged from. If the first customer service person isn’t answering the questions, ask for the supervisor, if the supervisor can’t answer ask for the manager, and so forth up the chain. You should absolutely know why and what you’re paying for.
Start by looking at her last bill line by line. It’s unlikely they are intentionally scamming her, but she could be incurring overages unknowingly, or there could just be some sort of mistake on their end. But to figure it out you need to start with discerning what precisely they’re charging her for.
