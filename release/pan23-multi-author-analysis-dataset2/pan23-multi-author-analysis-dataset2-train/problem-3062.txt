Legally, the issue here at hand is employment tax + income tax fraud. Your boss should have been withholding and remitting employment taxes and income taxes from you for the last 29 years, as well as his employer portion of employment taxes.
You need to speak with your boss and let him know what his son told you. If your boss really wants to make sure that you receive compensation after he dies he can either write you directly into the will, or he can even have his estate buy you an annuity that pays out yearly.
The other legal issue that I presume you're asking about is the 10% of your boss' net worth when he passes. If he is unwilling or unable to put that in his will, and his son (who from your description is the executor of your estate) is unwilling to make good on his father's promise, then you are SOL.
Going forward, your best option in preparing for retirement is to begin working NOT under the table. Either for your current boss, but he withholds and remits appropriate taxes, and you file income tax returns also reporting said income/paying taxes, or for someone new. If your boss isn't willing to do that, will he at least provide a good reference for you? If he does that, you \should\ be able to find a new employer who is willing to hire and pay you in accordance with tax laws. As another commenter mentioned, you only need 40 quarters/10 years of (taxpaying) work to qualify for social security. Don't put off starting, because as you age you're only more at risk for potential issues that would prevent you from working/earning money.
