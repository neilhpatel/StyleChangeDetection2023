Paying you on a per-client basis is not necessarily illegal, and doesn't mean you aren't still an employee (as opposed to a contractor). The FLSA allows employees to be paid on a piece-rate basis (i.e. you receive a certain amount of pay per unit of production; in this case for each client visit). As long as the piece rate results in you being paid at least minimum wage ($7.25/hr) for all hours actually worked (including both those spent working during client visits and those spent doing other work for your employer such as admin tasks between visits), it is generally legal. If you end up working over 40 hours a week (again, counting all work, not just work on client visits), you would have to be paid overtime rates for those extra hours; the FLSA explains how that is calculated for piece rate :
> Piece rate - The regular rate of pay for an employee paid on a piecework basis is obtained by dividing the total weekly earnings by the total number of hours worked in that week. The employee is entitled to an additional one-half times this regular rate for each hour over 40, plus the full piecework earnings.
My understanding is I am now essentially a contractor when I was salaried with a 35 hour weekly contract. They plan to compensate only for work completed, including client visits and trainings (though it's unclear if notes and such are also included). So everything appears to now be piece work compensation with no warning.
