California requires that employees who work at least 5 hours are entitled to a meal break of 30 minutes. This 30 minutes can be unpaid, but must be provided free of other work requirements. Encouraging employees to skip or work through this break can subject the employer to penalties.
If an employer does not allow employees to take a lunch break then the employees are entitled to an extra hour of pay per lunch missed. In this case, that would be 1 hour plus the time wrongly deducted.
Further, employers are required to pay for time worked, not for time scheduled. If an employee is required to stay 20 minutes over time then the employer must compensate them for that time. An employer cannot deduct time taken for lunch if you're not taking a lunch. There are rules about rounding time, but they have to be consistent. For example, if you're docked .1 hours for clocking in 1 minute late, you must be paid .1 hours for clocking out 1 minute late.
That’s a breath of fresh air, I prefer not to take meal breaks due to the strenuous nature of field, they say it’s state law that I take a lunch so I deduct my “lunch” from my windshield time between jobs to appease them. If I were to bring it up and they fired back with something along the lines of mandatory lunches being company policy per se, State law would supersede company policy right? Iowa policy is backasswards I know that much.
Iowa doesn't require any breaks for employees, including lunch breaks. However, if your employer is not paying you for hours worked then it is a violation of Iowa's labor laws.
Fuck it just leave me alone and let me work, seems like they just try to force the issue to jip me out of 2.5 hours every week.
