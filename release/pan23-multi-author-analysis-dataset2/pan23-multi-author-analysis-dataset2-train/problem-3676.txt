If your roommates ESA is "registered" as opposed to being recommended by a medical professional currently treating him, it's probably not a real ESA.
That being said, if you both are on the same lease together, a violation by one is a violation by all, so tread carefully.
“Just a heads up, I’m bringing my emotional support animal home tonight. I have been approved by my mental health professional and my documentation and ferret have been approved by (company). If anyone does not believe my statement, I can disclose the emails I had with (relator) from (company) proving my statement.”.
Edit: “company” in both cases is in reference to our rental agency for this property sorry for any confusion.
But I signed this lease expecting no animals in the house, I feel as if that’s wrong. (Also listened to this roommate and another trash mental health issues this fall when I was talking about seasonal depression) (now he’s got an ESA?) I am also a horticultural production major, and have many house plants, some toxic to ferrets. If the ferret gets into the plant am I therefore responsible even though I wasn’t the one responsible for “watching” the ferret at the time?
