So for instance if you commit a crime in town A and then drive all the way to town D, a cop from town A could come and arrest you or give you a ticket? Simply because it was in their town?
So you could commit a crime in town A, leave the town, go home, eat a sandwich, go to bed, get up, go to work the next morning, and then get arrested in town Q for the crime you committed the previous day/week whatever.
The statute of limitations (the amount of time the government has to prosecute you for a crime) is measured in months or years in most cases.
Following you for some period of time before stopping you is not going to make any difference at all, legally speaking.
Pre-trial diversion programs are meant for offenders like you. Hire an attorney to help you get that plea bargain, and if you serve the probation term without getting in trouble, the conviction will never be entered and that will protect your FAFSA renewal eligibility.
I'm not certain that a tag light equipment violation is the kind of thing that counts as a municipal ordinance or statute violation for the purposes of an out-of-jurisdiction pursuit under , or that the warrantless search was valid, but those are technical and fact-dependent questions you'll need a local attorney to answer.
Edit: there was that would have removed tag lamp violations as the sole basis for a traffic stop but it's not in the SC Code so I presume it failed, and those pretext stops are legal. Can't say about the search without more details.
