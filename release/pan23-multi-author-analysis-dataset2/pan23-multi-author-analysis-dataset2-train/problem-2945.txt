CVS tends to have two different ways of classifying pharmacists — salary and hourly- hourly tend to be the floating pharmacists.
Please note that the US Court of Appeals Second Circuit found pharmacists to be exempt from overtime pay — ie time and a half — Anani v CVS RX F 3d 146 2nd CT 2013.
I am confused — are you staying extra and not being paid at all? Have you thought of just working the 40 some hours? And let them bring in a floater.
All is not lost, though. You work in a regulated industry, and public safety is at issue in addition to your wellbeing. Moreover, you’re far from the only pharmacist in Missouri experiencing these conditions. In July, the Missouri Board of Pharmacy launched a task force to investigate hundreds of complaints identical to yours:
It appears that the appellant, in that case, was paid for overtime, but at less than time & a half.
I am tempted to advise the pharmacist to punch in when he arrives & punch out when he leaves until he/she is threatened but instead will advise that only at such time he/she wishes to lose the job. Instead, try contacting HR, not at the store level, go up one level above the "upper management likes to point out that I’m salaried". The manager may be fired if he/she is violating company policy or the law.
