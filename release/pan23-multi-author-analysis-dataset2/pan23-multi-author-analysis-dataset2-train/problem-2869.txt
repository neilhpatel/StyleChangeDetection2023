"Where they talked about" isn't specific enough. Your wife doesn't have to send one penny back to anyone right now but she needs real legal help, she needs someone to go over the will and what it actually says.
All of the checks are made payable to my wife, but there was an aspect of the will that because the kids all inherited different land estates from the grandparents they tried to use the liquid money to "even" the amount that everyone received, but it just seemed weird to us to get a bunch of checks payable to my wife, and then have to send them to someone else to then get the money back. Surely the checks should have just been sent to the estate account to begin with for distribution?
Was she a named beneficiary? If so she doesn't have to return the checks (probably). If these were erroneous distributions, then she probably does. You need to provide a lot more information before anyone can give much more.
But who do they come from, who sent them, what accounts did the funds come from? The family's request might be kosher or might be bogus. There is no way to tell here without knowing who sent the money, from where, and why.
