They all seem to run on a Republican ticket, which is interesting because it showcases the gap between their candidates and their constituents. They have to lie now, blatantly, in order to appear to be like everyone else. The media has been dropping the ball here, in my opinion. A well-informed electorate relies on journalism that does not rely so much on content like "You Won't Believe What MTG Just Said"-style headlines. The Santos thing was exposed by smaller outlets that had a limited reach but larger outlets like the NY Times ignored it until after the election. Why? Page views?
You mean the whole of the house GOP? McCarthy has the power to call vote remove him from Congress. Every house Republican has the power to call for a vote to remove the speaker if he doesn't. Every single house Republican is enabling George Santos.
