The best thing to do at this point may be to let him come, get his stuff without fighting or arguing. It may be worth it for your mom and aunt to go... get a coffee or talk a walk while he's there. Someone should be there to supervise, but I want to emphasize no fighting or arguing. Let him get his things and let him leave.
Yes. She gives him written one month notice to vacate and then if he's not gone by the date she specifies she takes him to court to evict him, and then if he still won't leave, a sheriff with a court order comes to remove him.
Usually, when someone says that they're bringing the cops while they get their stuff, that means they want the police on what's called civil standby just in case something happens while they're trying to retrieve their belongings.
He's pretty manipulative, so his reason for bringing in the cops is definitely for civil standby, but it is also a weird threat/manipulation tactic he often uses to scare my mom, and he would most likely be the one to cause argument or do something, and he knows how afraid she is of the police.
