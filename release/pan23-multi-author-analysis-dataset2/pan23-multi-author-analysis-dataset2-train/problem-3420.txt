First thing is to reach out to the landlord and clarify, potentially reminding them that you're in the middle of a fixed-term lease. It could be a simple mistake on the landlord's part. It could be something else.
You’re under no obligation to agree to any addendums to your lease. The landlord cannot unilaterally change the lease in the middle of it.
Our lease doesn't say anything about the rent increasing. The letter we received says "this notice will act as an addendum to the original lease with that amends the monthly rent amount and shall increase to [X amount of rent here].".
The letter we received says it will "act as an addendum to the original lease". So, that's not possible to just decide to add an addendum like this to our lease? There's nothing in our lease about rent increases or addendums.
If your landlord insists on these changes you can remind them that you have a lease you’re perfectly happy with as is and they can discuss modifications with you that would take effect only once the fixed term concludes.
They cannot add an addendum without your consent, otherwise you could add an addendum lower your rent without their consent. Don't sign anything agreeing to the rent increase and don't pay it. Remind them that you have a legally binding contract that they cannot alter until the lease term ends.
