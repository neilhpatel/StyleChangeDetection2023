It should be noted that these are 2020/2021 numbers and 2022 was a banner year for renewables. I expect the next two years to be even better. Public adoption of renewables is picking up speed, and our infrastructure is finally starting to catch up. It’s way more cost effective to invest in renewables now for regular households, businesses, and governments. You save a hell of a lot of money in the long run, and the government will help fund your switch. Small businesses and ag producers are especially leaning into the change. It’s great for their resiliency and bottom line.
USA here, Central Pennsylvania to be exact. Tommorow is predicted to be 59 degrees (15 celcius) and Wednesday 65 degrees (18 celcius) with possible "heavy thunderstorms." Yep. Completely normal for this time of year. This is where the fun begins.
The US has been fucking wild with weather. I was in Arkansas a week or so back and it was -2 with windchills at -10. Get home to Michigan and the next week all the snow is melted and it’s raining.
