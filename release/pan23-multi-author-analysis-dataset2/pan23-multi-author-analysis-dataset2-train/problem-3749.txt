Pretty hard to shoot someone if you can't see them. If you can see them, they probably aren't going to try and steal the truck when you are standing there with a pistol.
Also robbed implies armed force, which you cannot presume and simply shooting an unarmed person who walks onto your neighbors property without challenge isn't going to fly.
You have to believe your life is in imminent danger in order to use lethal force. Injecting yourself into the middle of a robbery of someone else's property is insufficient defense.
NAL but you really shouldn’t be planning to use this gun to play vigilante and protect other peoples property.
Under Texas’ castle doctrine you should only use deadly force if your life is in danger or you have a legitimate fear deadly force will be used against you, look up TRAN Vs STATE. I remember hearing way back in the day in Texas supposedly you could use deadly force to protect YOUR property, but I’m not sure if that’s the current case and if it was your answer is still a big hard no as you don’t own your neighbors property.
Off topic but please get proper training, mental and physical, for your firearm OP, learn when you “should” use it and how to use it safely for your families sake 🙏.
