Kh-555 are domestically produced [in Russia]. They won't "run out" unless they are planning to actually discontinue production. They will simply slow their rate of fire to be equal to or lower than their rate of production.
They're still a nation state and there's zero chance that they'll actually have to entirely stop production on most of their weaponry. Expecting that day to come is what could force this to become just another "victory will come when they collapse any day now" kind of conflict that lasts for several more years.
Have we collectively forgotten that militaries in WW1 and WW2 were still able to produce weaponry and manpower despite far harsher environments and attrition? I mean yeah, Russia is hindered in it's ability to openly buy advanced western microelectronics, but they'll absolutely be able to produce some on their own and acquire some others on black markets. The world is a big place and while Russia is largely reliant on imports, it doesn't mean they have no internal capacity to generate war material.
