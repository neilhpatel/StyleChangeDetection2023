If it takes two adult women to hold a 4 year old still, that doesn't give one an image of a calm and motionless child, which provides the nurse an adequate defences against negligence. And it's very unlikely that a full dose of a childhood vaccine will cause you any harm. If anything, congrats on getting a free booster shot. If you do experience complications from the injection that results in real damages, you might have a case. A little swelling and soreness won't cut it. But if you do experience soreness and swelling, apply ice and elevate your hand above the level of your heart.
It sounds like an initial consult with an attorney would cost more than the damages youâ€™ve sustained.
You are, of course, welcome to speak to a lawyer about this, and you can sue for just about anything. But there's no guarantee that it will even make it to court.
IANAL. An accidental needle stick due to a wiggling child is not grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. Malpractice is actually quite difficult to prove and requires negligence that results in an injury. A needle stick will not be a sufficient injury. Even if it were, the nurse probably wouldn't be considered negligent. She didn't inoculate you intentionally or with malicious intent.
