Contact an employment lawyer if you think there’s something unique here, but in my experience this is pretty common and she’s going to end up paying it. Most/all of the 9k she owes the contract company was likely paid to a lawyer for the H1B and she’s only billed a few hundred hours since to make up for it. A lot of those staffing businesses are really low margin operations that can’t absorb the legal bills...passing them through to the employee is basically built in to the business model. It likely won’t matter that the contract isn’t notarized, or whether her new company is willing to absorb the cost of her transfer.
Are they actually requiring her to pay money upfront, or are they having her sign a contract with Obligated term of employment with a repayment clause? It’s relatively common for employers who offer certain benefits to require employees to agree to remain with the company for a specified term afterwards, and require repayment of the benefit of those terms are broken. My employer offers tuition repayment for education; but you must agree to remain with them for two years after using it. If not, you’re required to repay the tuition benefit.
Contracts like that do not need to be notarized to be valid; although signing it is usually a requirement under the Statute of Frauds.
