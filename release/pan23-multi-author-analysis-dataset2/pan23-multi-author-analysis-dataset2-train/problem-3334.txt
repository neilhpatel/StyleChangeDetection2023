Probably not much, at least directly. The teachings of the Lollards (Wycliffe and his followers and successors) were denounced as heretical in the 1370s. Wycliffe died saying mass in his pulpit in 1384, but in 1415 he was condemned as a heretic and posthumously excommunicated. His bones were exhumed, burned and scattered into the river. Lollardy went underground. Members of the sect who were found in England were burned. A man was sentenced to death as late as May 1532 for professing Lollard beliefs, though he was killed by a spectator before the fire could kill him. For context, the Submission of the Clergy began in April 1532, the first major step in the English Reformation.
Like all historical events Martin Luther's theses and the Protestant Reformation have a multitude of factors that are due to broader economic and social factors. It's not like Martin Luther appeared out of thin air - reality is that for hundreds of years prior there were movements advocating reform to the Catholic church: Waldensians, Hussites, John Wyclyff and the Lollards, etc. When we these movements together with the social/economic factors (raising middle class, invention of printing press) the change seems less sudden and more inevitable.
Edit: Followup questions about Luther, Huss, Wycliffe, or other religious figures, I should say. The Gunpowder Plot is not my specialty.
