Russia's a level 2, getting curb-stomped by a level 1, because level 60 NATO gave the level 1 a green level 3 sword they were about to vendor. Russia isn't even in the same zone as the level 60 NATO, much less fighting them. Russia's just fighting the level 60's vendor trash, and about to see pvp-death and get teabagged.
For reference that's a platform the US has about 500 of, AND Ukraine weren't even given the longer range missile pods for it.
In short, Ukraine haven't been given NATO's resources, they've been given a comparatively tiny sample of what NATO can field. Oh and lots of Soviet-era inventory from ex-Warsaw Pact NATO members.
Ya if nato joined... well not even nato just any of the top 5 nato members joind and decided to send in everything russia would be pushed back to its borders in weeks. Thats assuming the russian soldiers bullet sponges dident immediately break and route or surrender.
NATO's resources involve clear and overwhelming air superiority. The situation as it is now with artillery duels and slow moving lines on the map only happens when neither participant can establish air control. And once that exists, it's either a complete rout and clean up of fleeing conventional military forces from the sky (see Iraq in the 90s) or a guerilla war where the side without air control has to attack, hide, and repeat (see Iraq in the 2000s).
