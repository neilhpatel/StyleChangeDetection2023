This is what I would do. Even if they decide not to investigate, it's one more knock against him. Your complaint may help others to decide that he is not compatible with their views on healthcare. It's always a good idea to request to view any complaints against a new doctor.
Please keep replies on-topic and focused. Covid/vaccine disinfo will be met with removal and a ban. If you really, really need to let people know how much you've learned in your "research" on youtube there are many fora both on and off reddit for you to talk with other "researchers" who no doubt also have PhD's in dumbasserey.
If you're going to comment here, though, you can limit your replies to those that provide OP with info they can use.
Technically he’s not wrong about not knowing side effects “years down the line”. We only have data back to when the first clinical trials started last year. The probability of issues popping up long term is very small (much much smaller than Covid causing long term issues) but not zero.
Saying masks do nothing and trying to discourage patients from using them is not something he should be doing unless it's a concern they bring up.
That's not true, doctor's aren't entitled to give advice that may harm ones health. There's a difference between this and giving advice against vaccination because of a health concern of it not being safe yet.
