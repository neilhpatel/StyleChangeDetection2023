Your parents should contact their insurance company and report the claim. Their insurer may or may not cover the damages, depending on whether the sister was named on their policy and if not, whether she was a regular user of the car who lived with them or an occasional user of the car who didn't live with them.
Your parents could also be liable on a theory of "negligent entrustment" if they knew your sister was a dangerous driver or knew that she had history of driving drunk.
My sister has had a wet and reckless and a DUI in the past but this was nearly 20 years ago. I don't know if that makes a difference in this case.
Thanks for the response. My sister does not live with them and is not named on their policy. I assume this is bad news if I'm interpreting your comment correctly.
Actually, if she's not named on their policy, the fact that she doesn't live with them and uses the car only occasionally is a good thing. If she lived with them and regularly used the car and wasn't named on the policy, then the insurer would be more likely to deny coverage on the basis that she should have been named.
She's been arrested twice before for DUI and your parents knew that when they let her use their car? Yes, that's relevant to any claim against them and it's a bad fact for them. They can argue that it was so long ago that they didn't think she was a danger.
Understood and agreed. We have a call out to a lawyer but my mom is dealing with extreme anxiety so just trying to see what I can find out in the meantime. I've been doing plenty of Googling but it has been hard to find anything overly specific.
Thanks again, this is very helpful. Spoke to my mom and it was nearly 20 years ago that she got that DUI so I guess it's a matter of hoping that argument is well received.
