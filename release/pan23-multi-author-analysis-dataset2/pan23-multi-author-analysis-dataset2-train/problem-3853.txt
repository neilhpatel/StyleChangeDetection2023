There was a video in the article I posted. Times of Israel despite the name is pretty critical of Israel that’s why I chose that article. Of course yes all news sources are biased. I’m not arguing anything I’m just stating that this is a misleading article posted by OP. It made it seem like a bunch of just random settlers came running to a piece of land and started attacking people and put a flag in it and said mine now while the police helped and beat people up. Then upon further investigation it seems a non for profit group who legally bought an area that doesn’t appear to be in use other than being littered with garbage is a site if some ancient pool. This ancient pool will be excavated and open to the public as a site to visit. I just think it’s important to point out. You can conclude whatever you want from either article. Truth is always some where in the middle.
This has been going through the courts for around 2 years. It's the court ruling that's just come out in favour of the settlers, seizing the land and evicting the palestinians who've been leasing it from the church and living there for 70 years.
