It's a matter of much debate, and historians views have varied greatly over the years. Once, pretty much all historians thought that the migrations in fifth-century Europe were all great movements of people. Now, however, many believe that many of the barbarian groups were primarily military forces. Overall, it varied massively. For instance, the Belgic settlement in late Iron Age southern Britain seems to have only been the movement of the political and cultural elite, but the early migrations of Goths into the Roman Empire definitely included a high proportion of non-combatants (this is attested by written sources and art). Moreover, there also would have been migrations such as the Anglo-Saxon ones, that included a lot of non-combatants even though if was not a case of entire populations on the move. Quite simply, it varied a great deal and there was something of a spectrum; it wasn't just a case of army or nation, sometimes it was a bit of both. The Norman conquest of England might seem like a classic example of just the elite and army migrating, but it led to a lot of traders, craftsmen and even some peasants moving from the continent to Britain.
Bro It depends on the geographical structure and environment of the place they want to take control.
The same case with the Arabs when they conquered spain the bring their families and tribes with them because Spain is a warm country on the other hand when they invade france the bring just generals and armies because france is cold country.
Another example are the British the conquered large parts of the world yet they settled in large numbers only in places which share a similar climate with their own homeland like Canada , the United States and Australia.
