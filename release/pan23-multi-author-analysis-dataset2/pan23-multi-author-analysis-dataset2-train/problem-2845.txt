You can go through your insurance. They may not offer more. ACV is a little wacky right now, but regardless, what someone actually paid isn't material. What's the plan if they call your mom's bluff? (If they even speak to her about it, they may not.) What state are you in and what is its small claims court maximum?
Hiring an attorney over this wouldn't be worth it, and they know that. Aside from having the attorney write a scary letter.
Forgive me for being a obtuse, but I'm new to dealing with this sort of thing. This isn't an order of operations, but 4 choices of what to do, right? And what happens if the other driver can't afford to pay?
Sorry, it's sort of both. If you sue the other driver and win, then their insurance has to pay up to their policy limits. Have you spoken to your insurance about it at all? Also if you go through your insurance, you can sue the other driver for your deductible.
It wasn't a bluff either, we know some people who had to deal with this in the past, also with Progressive, and won, and they're recommending a few different lawyers. Someone else said to just use my insurance company's lawyers. The biggest issue is the 3 1/2 day notice to return the rental car and then being unable to talk to them for 2 days.
Also, I'm not sure if this helps, but I missed 1 1/2 days work and also left earlier one day for chiropractor, the biggest reason is that about 2 days after the wreck my shoulder came out of socket despite me not even doing anything at the time. (It's a chronic issue dating back about 3 years).
