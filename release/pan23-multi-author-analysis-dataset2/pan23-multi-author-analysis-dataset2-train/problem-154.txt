Do you have a formal, written contract stating that you would be "hired on" or given a raise if certain conditions are met? You haven't described anything illegal under federal employment law, though some states have stronger protections, so you'll need to give us your location for the most applicable advice.
My biggest point is that I have a card certifying me as a forklift driver, but I haven't had a pay change to show this since beginning certified in September.
Minnesota is an at-will state, and you're being paid well above the state minimum wage, so absent a contract or union CBA, the employer has no obligation to offer you a permanent position or increase your pay rate. That verbal agreement is not enforceable, unfortunately.
If you're a 'temp employee' through an agency, your compensation isn't necessarily in step with whatever fulltime/perm employees make.
The temp agency is paid through the company, and they may have a standard $13/hr compensation for workers that are provided.
I would concentrate on getting your status changed over from the temp agency to the companies payroll and becoming a 'perm' employee.
At this time, there is absolutely nothing illegal in the compensation disparity between you and the others. You're not an 'employee' of the company, you're an employee of the temp firm, that is placing you for shift work.
At minimum the temp agency is being paid $20/hr for your work provided. You get $12 of it, and likely a benefits package through your temp agency. What the company gets is flexibility.
