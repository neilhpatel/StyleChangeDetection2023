It seems like the Iranian Government is only good at two things. Killing it’s own people and arresting people for absolute heinous crimes like dancing. This is what you get when you give power to religious fanatics.
They are being arrested for filming it and making a public statement against the regime. That’s actually far worse than the official reasons… the regime tortures political prisoners in horrific ways. It’s because they are scared of the people, who mostly hate them.
History has already shown over and over how this gonna end for the tyrants, we don’t need to worry cause their end is already determined. It’s just tragic how many innocent and beautiful souls need to suffer to get to that point.
People always think grass will be greener.... have we stopped to look what we have before changing it... it could get worse.
Yeah like in China when those students and the PLA tossed out their leaders for something better.... or Russia when Stallin took over or in Iran when the students kicked out the pro American leader.... yeah revolts always lead to more peaceful leaders....
Ok you can be pro American or what they have now.... pick one.... Iran had F14 tomcat the top fighter intercepter at the time.... they had freedoms women's rights... after they kicked the USA out they have this....
