Should the provider fail to provide your records to you within 30 days of receipt of your demand, you need to file a HIPAA violation with the Office of the Inspector General. You can find the web form to submit a complaint as well as the information I've given you by googling 'HIPAA right to access'.
You need to submit a request for copies of your records to the provider in writing. At that point, they must be provided to you within 30 days. The provider is allowed to charge a reasonable fee to cover the cost of providing copies or CDs with your records on them. Your provider IS NOT allowed to withhold your records if you owe an outstanding balance for services rendered.
So there could be reason why they can’t share them. One if it was an in clinic Doppler the ultrasound images may not be saved. The record of it should be within the chart of the visit but there would be no images. Two of it was done at a ultrasound clinic they may have the images and not your doctor, however your doctor would have a radiologist report once it is read. Other then that I can’t image why they would not share them if they had a copy of them other then just being busy or not having them.
There may not be an actual record of it saved then. On ultrasound machines you have to record if you want to save it. I don’t record any of my ultrasounds done in clinic, because there just isn’t really a need since you are not having anyone else look at it. That doesn’t mean that there isn’t a record, because it could have been saved. You would just have to ask. But it should be documented in a chart that an ultrasound was done and what the urologist findings were. If they didn’t document it. Then they didn’t bill you for it. And then it becomes a different situation.
