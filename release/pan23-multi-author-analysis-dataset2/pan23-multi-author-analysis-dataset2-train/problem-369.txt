I think the saying that applies is "If you can't afford to buy a new car, you can't afford to fix a used one.".
Well the issue is they offered no warranty. They said I could purchase individual warranties for a certain parts of the vehicle, like the engine etc. But then I have to throw out an extra $1,000 per location. And that part just seems ridiculous. But there is You was no limited warranty even offered. Is that really something they can do?
Now you're saying if the dealer didn't know about these problems then they aren't liable for them. But what if these problems existed? They should be liable for them correct? If I can prove that these problems existed prior to my acquisition of the vehicle, do I have any sort of case there?
They aren't obligated or required to issue a warranty. The mileage is too high. State law requires warranties to be offered in different situations.
Lemon laws don't apply here for a multitude of reasons. In NJ the vehicle has to be 7 model years or newer with less than 100k miles on the odometer.
