Also, unless he has applied to be an authorized representative with CRA on behalf of OP, he's not allowed to file taxes on her behalf or even access her MyCRA profile online, that's totally illegal. to give him permission to file in her behalf, he can get into serious trouble. They're very strict about that kind if thing to avoid the very situation that OP finds herself currently in - someone taking benefits that they're not entitled to that belong to someone else.
Your father isn't even allowed to file your taxes for you or access your MyCRA account unless you have submitted an Authorize a Representative form to CRA for him to do that.
Once you became an adult, he would have needed to re-file an authorized representative form to be able to continue doing your taxes. is expected to have a parent handle tax matters but once you become an adult it's a new set of rules.
He got that when I was little and had level 2 clearance of it until I took him off this year. He's trying to tell me that he never did but my friend and her mom were literally there and saw it.
Edit: sorry, it's late where I am and I thought I read in your comment that they went there. My bad.
Its ok . I called cra to gain access to my online account, got my letter in the mail with the pass code and entered it while at my friends home. Her mother works for the government and wants to help me. She saw that my father had level 2 access to my account and advised me to take him off as soon as I could.
