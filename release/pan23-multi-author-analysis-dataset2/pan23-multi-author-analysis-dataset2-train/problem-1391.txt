edit: to the downvoters, I'm being genuinely curious and just asking for a little more detail. Not doubting /u/RetiredAerospaceVP.
Companies are pretty careful about outgoing money. There needs to an invoice or some contract to pay against. Someone will add up all the invoices and compare to the total of the checks paid out. It needs to match to the penny. Double payment happens from time to time. But there are systems in place to catch it.
If they’re a larger organization then it may take a while for it to catch up to you, but they’re going to figure it out and you will owe them the money back. Their accounting team will track down the payment when their books can’t be reconciled. That could be end of the month, quarter, or year. They will request a return of payment. If you refuse, or if you don’t pay in the timeline they request, they will likely file a small claims case to get the funds back.
Further, they may have already caught it and issued a stop payment order on the duplicate check. If that happens, and you proceed with cashing it anyway, you would be committing fraud.
