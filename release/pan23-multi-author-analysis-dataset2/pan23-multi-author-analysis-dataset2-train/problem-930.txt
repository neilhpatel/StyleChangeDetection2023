Not necessarily. Trademark law will recognize the rights of a party that used the mark before another even if that first party doesn’t have a registered trademark. Having said that, and with the caveat that the prior sentence is a very general, simple summary, it may be worth reaching out to a trademark attorney. An initial consult call should not cost you anything. I would advise against any sort of generic trademark application/registration company you find in a Google search. The scenario you are describing is one where a lawyer’s opinion may be handy.
I would notify them that they are infringing on your brand and trademark. Do this is writing and via certified mail.
If neither entity is using the mark in interstate commerce then this is not a federal trademark dispute.
I would personally recommend against using words like “infringing” if you were to contact the other company directly. The last thing you want to do is appear accusatory and combative as that could make them act the same and escalate the situation when an amicable solution may be available.
