It's more about the wasted resources. Commuting requires an extra vehicle and all associated vehicle costs, expensive office clothes, extra meals eaten out because your short on time to make lunch and dinner, buying coffee because you're running late, dry cleaning, etc etc .
Let’s assume you have a decently long commute of an hour each way and spend 9 hours per day at the office (8 hours work + 1 hour lunch) on a 4 day workweek that is 44 hours of your life. Working from home on a 5 day workweek is 45 hours.
Yes, there’s a lot of multitasking you can do with work from home but if I got an extra 24 hours of unrestricted time I could probably fit those chores in more efficiently, and still have flexibility to focus on family, health, vacation, or hobbies.
Commuting promotes consumption, and that's why the wealthy are so hell bent on keeping the practice going.
You just work 4x10 instead of 5x8 so it's the same hours worked per week. I'd gladly take that deal. Once I'm already at work for a full 8h, 2 more hours isn't a big deal, and I get a third day off? Where do I sign.
