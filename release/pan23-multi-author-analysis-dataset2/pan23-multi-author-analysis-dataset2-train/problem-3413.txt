For municipal court, no chance on challenging the virtual proceedings. Have you ever been to in-person municipal court? Disaster and disorganization every time because almost everyone is self-represented. The NJ Supreme Court has already determined that virtual proceedings (including juries!) are permissible, with very few, serious, specific exceptions.
Try to keep your nose clean, but if you get another ticket, it would definitely be worth the cost of an attorney to keep your license. Meanwhile, if you are able, try to get your phone as hands-free or through the steering wheel as possible. And watch out for phone use at red lights - technically a violation, although idiotic in my opinion. I feel you on the virtual court - you should see the domestic violence calendar in action.
It sounds like your best bet is to stop using your phone while driving. New Jersey's distracted-driving laws might be tough, but also don't leave a lot of room for mis-interpretation. Need to change songs over Bluetooth? Pull over to do so. Otherwise keep your phone in the glove box or something.
