Well for the Governor race the pool was pretty terrible in the GOP primaries. It’s like they (the GOP) didn’t even care about it. They essentially handed Shapiro Harrisburg and funnily enough, I believe Mastriano hurt Oz.
The sudden disappearance of so many Mastriano signs on Wednesday was really satisfying to see lol. And the ones that are left have been blown down by the wind.

Mastriano still has yet to concede and is now stooping down to ranting on Twitter at Shapiro for pushing a “smear campaign” against him.
