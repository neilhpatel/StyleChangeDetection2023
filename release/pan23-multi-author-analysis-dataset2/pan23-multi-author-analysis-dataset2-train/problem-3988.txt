Forgot to mention- you will need to get the Pfizer vaccine, that is the only one approved for 16-17 year olds (the others are 18 and over). In my county (SantaClara), the appointment website says to make the appt at specific sites to make sure they are using Pfizer.
Nevada allows mature minors to receive vaccines without parental consent. Not sure how close you are to the border or if the covid vaccine is covered under the statue.
For another state, it indicated that two nurses had to verify that the parents were actually approving the teen could get the vaccine. Don't know if it is the same in CA.
In my county (Santa Clara County) there is a printable form online for parent to sign consent. I think they also will call the number on the form to confirm. 16-17 year olds can go by themselves with the signed form. Google "(your County) covid vaccine minor".
