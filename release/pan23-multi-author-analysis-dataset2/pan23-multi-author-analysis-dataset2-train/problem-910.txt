I went to Antarctica a few years back summer the Southern Hemisphere summer. Multiple days I was there is was 60 degrees F (15.5 C), literally wore a T shirt in Antarctica. So sad the impacts climate change is havingâ€¦.
Has anyone wondered if everywhere warming-up is a good thing? Because cold is the steady state, hot is the anomaly.
We are not meant to live in temperature extremes, but lower temperatures are even more antithetical to our physical being.
Say that in six months during our yearly heatwaves when crops world wide get destroyed, more forests burn, and we have more "once in a lifetime" fires.
Scientists studying Antarctica's vast Thwaites Glacier - nicknamed the Doomsday Glacier - say warm water is seeping into its weak spots, worsening melting caused by rising temperatures, two papers published in Nature journal showed.
Thwaites, which is roughly the size of Florida, represents more than half a meter of global sea level rise potential, and could destabilize neighboring glaciers that have the potential to cause a further three-meter rise.
