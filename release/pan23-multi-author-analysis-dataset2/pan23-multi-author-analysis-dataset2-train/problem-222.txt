In many states moving your plates from one car to the other before they've been properly registered is a surprisingly serious offense.
Between the insurance issue (you do have valid insurance for the car?) and the potential risk of being charged with an offense on the plates, I guess I'd talk to a lawyer here.
While I to some extent agree with what I think your point is - that this conduct was pretty obviously problematic, I'm not sure I would have guessed jail time.
And I agree with /u/Vodkasodasandwich that this offense, as apparently committed doesn't seem jail-worthy. I'd be awfully surprised to see this defendant sentenced to jail. Though we'd be remiss not to note the possibility.
It just seems like so many people think a license plate is just required to cover a certain part on the rear of your car and have no concept as to what it actually represents.
My new vehicle is registered and on my insurance plan. The dealer put my old plates on my new car to use until my new ones arrived.
In Colorado it is absolutely not appropriate to move plates from car to car until they've been properly registered. Your dealer should have issued you a temporary permit.
Not sure if this makes a difference, but theyâ€™re Iowa plates (I just moved here 5 months ago). The dealer put my old plates on my new car and told me to change them out when I got my new plates.
