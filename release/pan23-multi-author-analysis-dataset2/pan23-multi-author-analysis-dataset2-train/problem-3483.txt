I didn't say your question was "a status." I said you created a strong inference by asking the question.
If your doctor had given your boss your vaccination status, it would be a legal issue. Your doctor didn't, you did, of your own accord, by asking "is it mandatory," created a strong inference that you were not vaccinated. Essentially, you volunteered that you were either not vaccinated or were refusing to share your vaccination status.
In any event, the only information your boss used came from you, not a medical provider. Therefore, no legal issue. Even if it was a violation of some statute, you have suffered no damages. But if you want to call some lawyers, feel free.
You have now confirmed that with corporate. No medical provider has illegally provided information, and you don't have a legal issue here.
Regardless, it's not at all illegal for your employer to discuss your vaccination status with his corporate higher ups. He can infer that status if you refuse to answer yes or no, and that is what he did. Again, no laws were broken whatsoever.
