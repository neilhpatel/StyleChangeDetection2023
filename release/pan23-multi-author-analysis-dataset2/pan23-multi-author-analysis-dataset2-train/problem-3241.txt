I know that it states I pay to reserve their spots if I am choosing not to bring them in for whatever reason and for their holiday closures, but I just don't understand if it would require separate statement more specific to an emergency closure. I'll read over it more carefully tomorrow, thank you.
Also important to consider: How long's the contract for? Under what circumstances can they terminate? How hard/expensive/etc would it be to find another daycare?
Contract is month to month with two week notice required to leave, otherwise I owe two weeks tuition. I live in Washinon. I'm not sure about their right to edit/terminate. It will be difficult to find another daycare. However, I don't know that continuing in a situation where I will more than likely experience this again due to Covid is the best option either because paying for a sitter and daycare whenever someone gets sick is not affordable for two kids. Other daycares around here cover the expense (know other people with kids who's daycare shut down).
You'll find that most day cares operate under this "you're paying us whether we're open or not policy.".
