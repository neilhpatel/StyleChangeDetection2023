Though there is legislation against exclusive agreements with ISPs, this is one law with a true loophole: the landlord can simply not allow other providers permission to come onto the property to install competing internet service equipment.
Note that it’s just about explicit exclusivity agreements (meaning the landlord was dumb enough to, say, put it in writing), and doesn’t really prohibit a landlord from simply denying other competing services permission to come onto the property to install the requisite equipment.
If your landlord has an explicit exclusivity agreement, then yes (or rather, file a complaint with the FCC).
I did some more digging, apparently the internet provider is owned and operated by the Michigan division of the same company that owns this apartment complex.
If service provider 3 needs to use one of the above methods but they don't own the mainline or offer service in the building it would be very costly to do and would require permission. Because the company wouldn't install internet for just 1 apartment.
The other issue could be, that they don't have wiring. In apartments all the wires go to a central location. Could be a punch block or a lock box. From those locations go to the main line. E.g. if it's an older building it may not have coax connections. If it's newer it may not have phone connections (new build houses/apartments in some areas have strayed away from phone).
