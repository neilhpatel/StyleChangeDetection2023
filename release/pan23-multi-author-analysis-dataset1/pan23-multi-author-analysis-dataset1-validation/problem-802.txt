Fortunately not true. I’m from NJ with a GA Id and when I went back up to visit I bought legally with no issue. I was up for a while and did stay in state.
Lol, I feel like if someone posts: "my roof is leaking, help", I could just farm karma by replying with an irrelevant screed against Christianity (or, even better, one against Islam with vaguely racist undertones) and still rake in dozens of upvotes. Reddit is so predictable.
Shockingly and sadly, the cause of Delaware’s legalization failures has been our unpopular democratic governor vetoing every attempt, and the pharmaceutical lobby that he has a lot of ties to.
That’s what I did. Dumbass cops. This is why I smoke joints. Easy enough to flick out window. Thank god it’s becoming legal across more and more states. I have not had any encounters with law enforcement since I moved to a legal state & that was almost a decade ago.
I should also add that I’ve done this and the city settled rather than to take it to courts. They’ll stop doing this shit if enough people had the testicular fortitude to hit these fuckers in the pocketbook.
