You can try to get a doctor to see him and listen to your stories of what he has done, and see if they would support something involuntary, but it's kind of a long shot especially if he doesn't cooperate and he can control himself in the doctor's presence. (This could include a "guardianship" where someone else would be empowered to make legal decisions for him, and could thus "voluntarily" admit him to a hospital. That's a legal process you would also need a lawyer's help with - but the doctor is a necessary part of this. You could start with a lawyer who might know doctors who will help with this kind of situation.).
I agree completely about getting her out of the situation I’m hopeful to have some sort of hospitalization as a solution by the end of the day but it’s extremely difficult with Tennessee’s laws to get involuntary hospitalization. He lies to the psychiatrist and his statements directly contradict what he has previously stated in court, but it doesn’t seem as though they’re taking any action based on this.
