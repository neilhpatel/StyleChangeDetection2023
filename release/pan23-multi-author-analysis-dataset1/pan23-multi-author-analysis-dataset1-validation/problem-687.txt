Singapore’s leaders thus took a number of steps to try and put Malaya’s Malay leaders at ease, such as designating Malay the national language of Singapore, selecting a Malay anthem when Singapore achieved self-government in 1959, and, presumably, recognising the Malays as the “indigenous people of Singapore”.
The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.
Thanks for this interesting answer, and sorry for a stale response. But can you please say more about the connection between Malay royal culture and Alexander the Great? How did this come about? They are so distant geographically, and it seems like the closest possible cultural transmission would be via India, but to my knowledge the memory of Alexander was lost in India within a few hundred years of his visit. How did his memory influence a culture so much further east?
