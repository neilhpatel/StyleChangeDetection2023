I gotta laugh at Orban he was warned about this months ago but the Vatnik loving gobshite wanted exemptions and deals to get cheap Russian oil and gas, now he has no choice but to find new sources because Russia fucked itself by blowing up Nordstream and supplies through Ukraine cannot be guaranteed thanks to the war.
But why is this important? Well, in the last year, while Russia was getting beaten, the Turkic countries (Turkey + old Russian sphere) were at full speed on integration. Using the Organization of Turkic States, Turkey and Kazakhstan for example, turned their export turnover from 2B to 5B and now they are aiming 10B, which would almost make Turkey Kazakhstanâ€™s largest trading partner (while Russia's trade is downhill), same for the other Turkic nations.
Agreed. And at the initial confusion European countries were looking to Germany to see if they boycott Russia or not. Once they did, after realizing which way the wind was blowing, it opened the floodgates for further sanctions.
Isnt Russia partially occupying Georgia? Whats stopping them from pushing deeper if they're already in? Also Hungary isnt exactly a great ally and will likely use this connection against the EU in any future disagreements.
