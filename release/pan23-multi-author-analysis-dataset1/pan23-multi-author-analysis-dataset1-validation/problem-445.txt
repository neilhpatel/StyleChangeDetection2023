There is unanimous agreement that the political entity of the Western Roman Empire declined in the 5th century, because it wasn't there at the end of it. However, the eastern half was fine. What did transform was the culture, and although culture changes and develops, to say that it "declined" would be imposing our opinion according to largely arbitrary criteria that are also just our opinions. A monk from the 12th century would take one look the average 21st century music video and think our culture's gone to shit, because there's no religious iconography, half the lyrics repeat rather than being original, and it's probably about sex. Hell, some singers are openly homosexual and work that into their lyrics. To us, this is a liberated culture. To our medieval monk, it would be primitive barbarity.
Excellent answer. You even make me laugh because I imagined a medieval monk watching and reacting to Lil Nas X's last song video. Anyway, could you please tell me where those beautiful statues that you linked are (I think a cathedral, but I don't know which) as a reference when next time someone says "medieval people were stoopid and ancient art could be imitated only from 1400 onwards when people became atheists again after reading Greek literature" or something along these lines.
Thanks a lot for the answer! It truly helped me understand the usefulness of the concept. It doesn't deny the fall of the WRE... But it helps put the rest of the processes in perspective.
