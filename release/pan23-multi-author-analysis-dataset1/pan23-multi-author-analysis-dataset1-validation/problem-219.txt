...they are still inching closer to capturing Bahkmut after suffering horrendous casualties, mostly among their Wagner Mercenaries whom they don't give a shit about.
Where did u get this info from? That means Russia lost almost a 100k in the last three months alone.. pretty exaggerated claims seems to me and if it's true then Russia wouldn't have been able to hold a front across 4 different provinces. Ofc they are losing many soldiers but nothing close to the numbers you claim. The first casualty of war is the truth and I don't expect both Russia or Ukraine to tell the truth about casualties. Usually they exaggerate the causalities of the enemy and down play their own for obvious morale reasons.. so I will always take such exaggerated claims with a huge grain of salt.
The point is Both sides make falese claims for morale and propaganda reasons, but these claims need to be taken with a massive grain of salt because there's political and propaganda motives behind it. Don't believe everything both sides say.
