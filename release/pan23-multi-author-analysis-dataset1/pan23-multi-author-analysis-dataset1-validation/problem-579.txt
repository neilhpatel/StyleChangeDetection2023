But the balance of power didn't shift to Europe in the sixteenth century. The Ottomans nearly held Austria and Bohemia by the time of Suleiman's death in 1566 and the Habsburgs came to a peace agreement where they had to pay tribute to the Ottomans. Istanbul was a massive trading center during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that brings in merchants from all over Europe, and latecomers to overseas colonization like England wanted, and had, an active trading company to access not just Istanbul but other Middle Eastern cities the Ottomans controlled like Damascus.
Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we're letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as 'Why didn't X do Y' relatively often don't get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, 'why didn't X do Y' questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It's worth remembering that people in the past couldn't see into the future, and they generally didn't have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn't necessarily look that way at the time.
