The founders were quite aware of their hypocrisy: it bothered some quite a lot- Franklin was bothered enough to free his slaves and agitate for the general abolition of slavery. Jefferson fully admitted slavery was an evil , but it was convenient to his lifestyle. Washinon had little qualms about using slaves until later in his life, when he expressed doubts, and his will freed a good number. Of all the Founder slaveowners, Monroe was perhaps more typical of the general attitude: slavery is bad but useful. One day we'll figure out a way to get rid of it, but not now. Monroe was in favor of abolition in theory- but he would not free any of his slaves, and he had his secretary at his elbow, begging him to do just that. I think "hypocrisy" fits well enough.
All of that said, a fair number of the themes supported by the Commission's report including the sentiment that America is special and unique, that Indigenous Americans are not part of American history, that the founders were akin to gods among men, may sound familiar to many Americans as they're already incorporated into history education through a mechanism described as Americana. In this older answer on why American schoolchildren say , I provide more context on the construct and how it fits into American education history and the history of history education.
Is that true? How common has slavery been in human history? And how common was it in the world in 1776?
To say the President's speech exhorted his rallying supporters to be peaceful and that it was only "splinter groups" of them storming the Capitol ( and to deploy that passive voiced "mayhem followed" instead of , say, "they smashed their way past the police and people died") shows a much keener devotion to his political faction than to factual information. And the same can be said for the 1776 Commission.
It was not a bad thing to keep the passage out in 1776. At the time of Jefferson writing it, the Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, had offered freedom to any slaves who escaped their rebellious masters and went over to the British . This had the effect of alienating the southern slaveholding elite, which had previously often been Loyalist. That turned out to be pretty important later, when the British strategy shifted from the north to trying to put down the revolt in what was thought to be a more sympathetic south. Dunmore's proclamation was an important reason why that strategy failed. (Interestingly , Jefferson's 1776 draft of the Virginia Constitution would also complain of Dunmore setting slaves in rebellion- at the same time it was calling for slavery to end, by 1800....Jefferson was complicated.).
Its a series of articles written by the New York Times that reevaluates history to show how African Americans have been suppressed, ignored, or disadvantaged throughout America's existence. From what I can tell, the orginal purpose of the project was to make us more mindful of how race could play into different parts of our society, for better or for worse, but it was not exactly meant to be used as a teaching tool. Because of this the implication that were brought up in the project, while not exactly flat out wrong, were a bit exaggerated, or at the very least debatable. Again, it was a series of persuasive articles more meant to make us recognize how race could play a bigger role in society then we think it does, then be a reteaching of American history as a whole.
However, the project was starting to be taught at high schools and even middle schools when talking about racial discrimation in U.S. history. This angered a lot of conservatives to which provoked Trump to bring together a team, largely made up by Republican political scientists and lawyers, to write their own document to not just counter act the idea of how race plays into society brought up by the 1619 Project, but also work as its own reference for teaching in schools, which is the 1776 Commission.
