Further action against the apartment complex would be for their security attacking me, to me that seems negligent on their part and plays a part in my pain and suffering. The department would also be about the same reasons but also for an increased sense of threat/danger as this individual has access to my home address and other information not as easily accessible to a normal civilian.
Honestly this doesn't pass the smell test. I'm not accusing you of lying but it is very hard to believe that a security guard, unprovoked, approached and assaulted you. Keep that in mind going forward.
It gets a little more complicated with law enforcement since some are empowered (or even compelled) to take actions off duty and are protected off duty under their agency (for example if someone was robbing a gas station and an off duty police officer was there they could use their service revolver to shoot the suspect if that was appropriate- and can use their agency handcuffs to detain a suspect).
Thank you. What led to the altercation is undetermined other than an unprovoked attack. He approached me, he pushed me to the ground as I was trying to leave and then punched me multiple times when I got up again. I never threw a punch or attempted to fight back as it happened so quickly.
