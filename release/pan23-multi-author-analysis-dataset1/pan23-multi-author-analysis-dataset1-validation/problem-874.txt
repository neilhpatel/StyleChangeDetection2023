There is a heavy, heavy western European bias, especially without the competition of Soviet scholars to make Russian a big player. For Assyriology, there is a lot of good scholarship being done in Iraq (especially archaeology, both because of the obvious locational benefits and impressive institutions), but much is published in Arabic and makes a lot less impact, or a lot slower impact, than it should. For scholars wanting to work outside of European languages (or Arabic, maybe), there is limited opportunity. This makes developing a community of scholarship in that language much harder, reinforcing the lack of 'need' for Western researchers to engage with that language/community. The Finnish scholar Simo Parpola is foundational in Neo-Assyrian studies, and has taught a number of prominent Finnish students, but all publish almost entirely in English (not exclusively; German is also notable).
That’s so cool. I did modern history for my undergraduate, I started as a double in modern history and Russian language but after two years of Russian classes tanking my overall grade average I’m semi ashamed to say I dropped it, and went and wrote my undergraduate theses (I did two) on Kaiser Wilhelm (luckily lots of English sources, he spoke English) and military technology of the 30 years war (mostly English sources again, with the exception of a d e n s e book on French artillery written in the 19th century). I have such huge respect for you guys actually sticking it through and learning the languages, but I don’t think I ever really had the tenacity for it, and I had one of my Professors tell me i would learn more Russian going and spending a month in Estonia then in Scotland….
