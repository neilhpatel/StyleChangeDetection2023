There's also cases like the fully independent "Grand Duchy" of Lithuania which was a fully independent polity during much of the medieval period. I believe there's evidence to suggest the "Dukes" of Lithuania very much did think of themselves as kings and translated their titles as being that of kings. But I don't think i understand the matter fully enough to delve too deeply into that.
But yes, the rule wherein the Imperial electors, though they sometimes are really, really big, are still dukedoms is a consequence of the 1356 Constitution, which stated that there is only one King within the Empire (which is Bohemia, and the Habsburgs of Austria never even dared to proclaim Austria as a Royal entity, only up until the rather obfuscating level of "Archduchy").
Now in terms of the second question. As I hope i've demonstrated what exactly the powers of the nobility were varied between places and time periods. In some places while a noble might manage their land in the property sense royal institutions still played an important part in administering it, judges were appointed on royal authority and the law of the land was relatively uniform. In other places a monarch would have almost no involvement in the laws and administration of the lands of a noble.
