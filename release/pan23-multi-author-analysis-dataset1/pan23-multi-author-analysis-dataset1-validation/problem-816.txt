Romans often used reduced (partially evaporated) must that is essentially fresh grape juice to turn it into thicker and relatively sweeter and more aromatic natural syrup, resembling honey and called sapal defrutum or simply sapa. It was very popular, not unlike refined sugar today and Pliny the Elder in his Historia Naturalis bemoaned the fact that it is hard to find a wine that was not additionally sweetened. But what the grape syrup had in common with lead? It seems that the lead utensils were preferred in the process of defrutum production, as the best evaporation is provided by materials made of good heat conductors and thus metal pans were preferable to ceramic ones. Given that two most popular metals for everyday use were lead and copper (stainless and acid-resistant steel was not known yet and iron is much harder to work with) and the latter was considered inferior in that particular case, because acidic must reacted with copper, getting infused with copper acetates that are characterized by strong metallic taste and rather unpleasant odour. Of course, lead reacted in similar way, but the lead acetate (II) thus produced were sweet and largely oduorless and thus virtually undetectable in a very sweet product. This is why Romans were using either lead pans or bronze ones covered with a thin layer of lead, as evidenced by the aforementioned work by Pliny, Columella's De rei rusticae or Marcus Portius Cato's De agri cultura.
1. I've seen a bunch of threads talking baout how lead poisoning have a big effect on the empire is a myth, that wasn't what I was asking, just to clarify.
