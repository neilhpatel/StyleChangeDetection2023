Note that if the university loses accreditation for its online program, you may have trouble with transferring credits to a different institution and accredited degrees are worth significantly more than degrees from unaccredited institutions.
Not A lawyer, I do work at a university. I would try and contact the Dean of Students and or Dean of the school/program then the Provost. If these options don't pan out try and set up a meeting with the president of the university or their board of directors/ overseers.
Also a university employee. Departments usually have pretty wide latitude to set up adhoc "courses" for students to fill in gaps when a required course is not available for a period of time. The chair of your department should be able to help. These are extremely common even during normal circumstances.
Admittedly navigating colleges / universities can involve knowing a bit about organizational structure, policies/procedure/protocol, but also the politics within the organization and who the best student advocates are administratively.
That maybe all you can do, unfortunately! I know in the program I work in we had a professor pass in November and he was the only one that could teach specific classes and they have no plans to get some until the fall. This had completely destroyed several students overall class timelines so that have waved a 1 or 2 classes for their graduation completion. This program is only undergrad so I am not sure how that works in higher degrees.
