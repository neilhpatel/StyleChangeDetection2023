Most probably not voluntarily, that would be an admission of responsibility and/or guilt. Once you let his office know your request, they would most likely inform him and he would call his insurance provided attorney. I am an attorney and I most certainly advise him to absolutely not take a risk of liability. If you decide you need or want to sue him you will be required to prove he intentionally or unintentionally caused her problem(s). That will require a attorney that practices in medical malpractice, which will require a colleague to give convincing testimony said doctor was intentionally or unintentionally negligent, thatâ€™s a long and hard road. I am not providing legal advice, just a personal opinion of what to expect you will be facing in the future. Good luck, your mileage may vary.
As noted above, complications aren't necessarily malpractice. I imagine/hope she signed a lenhy informed consent form prior to this procedure. And I would guess that all of the complications were plainly spelled out.
