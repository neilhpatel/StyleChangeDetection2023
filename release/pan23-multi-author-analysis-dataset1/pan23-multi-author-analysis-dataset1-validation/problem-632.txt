Yeah, tribalism, specifically needing to be accepted by those who you call your peers out of fear of being shunned for breaking ranks, mixed with the fact that voting R and hating libs is preferable to researching and becoming informed about policy (or anything for that matter), especially when a large percentage of the GOP base are blue collar guys who work all week and would rather go fishing, hunting, catch up on chores, drink and party, or basically "check out" in their free time.
His father left Trump x 5 two buildings with hundreds of apts . Amazing source of income. What does he do?
When the election comes, checking R down the ballot makes them feel as if they are doing their part and their peers confirm their biases, because neither think critically about the situation, they just do what they are told will make their lives better, not ever noticing that their lives don't change much, if at all, and when it does, it's actually for the worse. Look at Texas and their energy grid or the price of insulin (which has been mostly fixed by Dems now), or social security.
