The other driver's insurance knows (or thinks they know) what happened. They have the accident report. They don't need any additional information from you, and anything that you say to them that give the appearance that you were negligent can be used to undermine your case. You have an attorney, let them handle the communications. Would you go to a deposition without an attorney? Why then would you take a phone call from the other driver's insurance and make a statement to them without counsel present?
You want to have any damage to your vehicle covered by the other driver's insurance. Their company will almost always low-ball you if your vehicle has to be replaced or has extensive damage, unless you represent an economic threat to their company and have the ability to extract resources from them in court. Insurance companies spend a lot of time and money analyzing accidents, the location, the type and cause of accident, the extent of the injuries, make, model, and year of the car, and they use that data to determine what a proper payout will be. It's almost always lower than that you want.
