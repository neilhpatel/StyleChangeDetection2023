Also, here, and sounds like in NC too from the response, you get to decide if you're filing the report to an extent (police aren't filing a case if they don't know about it) but once the state goes forward with charges, it is on them if they want to drop the case or not. The alleged victim can write an affidavit of nonprosecution but the prosecutor doesn't have to give a shit. Alleged victims write them all the time here and then look around all confused when they submit it and the prosecutor is like you know what? Nah, we're going forward.
The rule 11 is not referencing the damages, the clever thing here is the attorney using OP's misunderstanding of what 'dropping' the charges mean for a criminal case to imply that the offer included ending criminal proceedings and was extortionate. What's unprofessional is that he knows OP cannot 'drop' the charges, so he knows it's not extortion. He implies that ending the criminal charges are part of the offer and uses the contacting the DA and references statutes to imply that a civil trial and the recovery of actual civil damages would be barred.
Thank you. From the last line of the lawyer's email, it sounds like he's threatening me for "filing frivolous suits" if I file a small claims case now?
