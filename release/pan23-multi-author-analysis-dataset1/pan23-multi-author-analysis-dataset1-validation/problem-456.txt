Can't wait for this to be reflected in the cost of gas to homes in a good 6 months time. Annoying to see how increases apply to customers immediately but reductions take months.
No it isnt. Maybe im wording it wrong. Exact date to date its yes the same. Compare it with January 2022 u could say yes. Most people here have somewhere in the year renewal of contract. That means a part of 2021 can be i calculated too. Its still a LOT higher than then. It isn't something to be bright about cause the end user doesn't see a dent in his bill going down here including me who pays now more than double still compared to last year for gas and electricity (and im one of lucky ones to only have it double and not triple or quadruple like i know some). This situation sucks here in Europe and take my word for it for Americans its easy to support this war but for Europeans they will be fed up soon enough. Today the news here announced another 150 000 belgians need a installment plans to pay of their energy bills but hey the wholesale price is back to januar 2022 so we can all cheer right.
