I'm actually not exactly sure what you were trying to say , because you seemed to criticize a book called "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" for over-romantizing the era, and dislike mass media productions for over-glorifying.
You talk of genocide. Not unknown, Duan Jiong's campaigns against the Qiang in the late 160s have been called that, but it isn't a term used about the three kingdoms, even involving some of the most brutal accusations (Cao Cao in Xu, Sima Yi after conquering the Gongsun clan) I haven't seen professional historians use the term. Nor does anything compare to the Holocaust that I can think of.
"昔日桓、灵之世，汉统陵替，宦官酿祸；国乱岁凶，四方扰攘。黄巾之后，董卓、傕、汜等接踵而起，迁劫汉帝，残暴生灵。因庙堂之上，朽木为官，殿陛之间，禽兽食禄；狼心狗行之辈，滚滚当道，奴颜婢膝之徒，纷纷秉政。以致社稷丘墟，苍生涂炭".
A tremendous population drop but there are a few problems with taking this at face value. 140 is over four decades away from the civil war and from 168 onwards, the land was plagued by wave after wave of epidemics starting from the Antionne Plague. Another, if you notice the wording, is Jin didn't provide a full census but a taxation list, this was not a headcount but as Rafe De Crespigny puts it in The Three Kingdoms and Western Jin: A History of China in the Third Century A.D. "They may indeed be best understood as a series of quotas, indicating the assessed value and obligation of each unit, with no more than incidental relationship to the true population in each area.".
And this trend continued, in the 17th century Chen Zuoming wrote in a similar vein that Cao Cao has written many pieces, while they were imitating of the old odes, these came from his heart, he wrote about the concern of poverty, about the sorrow for the chaos, he talks about choices he has to make, and his desire to break free from this trend but failing. And that is probably the most important part, the literati of the time saw the amount of chaos and deaths and destruction in the time, and they talk about it and wrote about it, and everything seems so out of their control. The fatalistic writings of the time really show, almost as if it is someone looking for the morning star hoping for even a glimmer of light, but fear that even that tiny hope and desire would fail and disappoint them, again.
