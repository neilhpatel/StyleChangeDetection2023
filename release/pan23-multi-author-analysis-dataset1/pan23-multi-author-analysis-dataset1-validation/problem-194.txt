Do you have any kind of documentation from the hotel? If they charged your card, there's a record of the transaction somewhere (almost certainly on a specific reservation in their system, but there is a chance it's in an unrelated account depending on the hotel chain's software). You're well within your rights to demand a receipt for the transaction, why haven't you been sent one? If you have, what information is on it? Is it your name, your SIL's name, a combination of both; are they spelled correctly?
I sent the longer version of all this to the CC to dispute, the hotels reply referred to me by the wrong name 3 times, she claims to have called me twice with the confirmation number, and that there was a reservation in their system, also send some fuzzy screenshots that don't really show anything pertinent to the actual reservation. My phone records indicate they never called or texted me, and I've searched all thru my email for a response, nothing.
So far, the best "proof" I have is my phone log showing I didn't' receive the calls the manager claims she made.
