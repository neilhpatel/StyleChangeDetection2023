Also - make a “report” - it’s not going to be investigated, and you already know that, but make a report of emotional abuse due to isolating the children from their mom. It is a custody issue, not a CPS issue, so there won’t be an investigation, but it will put your name and contact info in the system, connected to your children’s names, so if an actual report is made, you can be contacted.
1. If he is not following court orders that needs to be addressed immediately. Now for little things (like say he drops off ten minutes late) you just document and wait until you've established a pattern or decide that it is just an occasional thing you are going to let go. BUT if you don't see your kids when you are supposed to even one day that is a super big deal. Without contact with your children for months is extremely concerning. I don't think the judge is going to be happy with either of you. (Him for not following the order and you for not taking action earlier.).
