For the early dating of Beowulf, check out Neidorf et al. 2014. +The+dating+of+Beowulf:+A+reassessment&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjY0taW6b_nAhXyV98KHSvmB7QQ6AEwAHoECAAQAgv=onepage&q=Leonard%20Neidorf%2C%20(ed.)%20The%20dating%20of%20Beowulf%3A%20A%20reassessment&f=false).
I can also mention a few more below, but they are clearly only for the starting points for your project. It should also be noted that Hadley's book rather focus on the 9th and early 10th century, so if you are mainly interested in the Vikings' activity around 1000 (i.e. the so-called 'Second Viking Age'), some additional books especially on the Late Anglo-Saxon England in general will also be useful for the project.
I compiled for the Vikings in England, though originally primarily for not so academic readers. As for your study project, I'd strongly recommend to begin with D. Hadley's The Vikings in England: Settlement, Society and Culture, Manchester: Manchester UP, 2006 that offers an academic overview of the topic. It is also good to search some other essay collection edited by her (Hadley).
