They have a contract with the landlord to have access to the cars on site. They have a contract with me after towing my car. Yes I was charged a fee. I am not currently seeking to get it returned. If it was in fact proven no notification was sent, I would seek this fee back, yes. As far as proving no notification was sent, as seen in my post thisnis information i do not have and am seeking advice on how to proceed with that. I have to establish that first though. Additionally as stated by the company itself, they are legally required to notify the DMV (again, admittedly not sure where but I assume NY) of tows within 30 minutes of completion. There's my interest in bringing this to court. They are legally required to complete an action, and I am interested in pursuing if this legally required action was taken. The only "fix" I would seek from this step is the admission that notification wasn't sent to the DMV. Court paperwork does not require financial compensation is sought. It also leaves room for unfulfilled legal responsibilities.
6. You do not know if they sent the letter to the CO DMV, the NY DMV, or not at all. If they did send to one of the DMVs, you do not know what might've happened to the letter, or if either DMV acted upon the information in the letter.
