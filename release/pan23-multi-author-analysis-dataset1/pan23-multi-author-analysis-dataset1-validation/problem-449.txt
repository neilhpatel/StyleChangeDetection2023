Many historians of Georgia that aren't Georgian accept the idea that the Georgian Bagrationi's came from a branch of the Armenian Bagratids. One of the most important scholars of this era, Cyril Toumanoff, was a major proponent of it, and wrote extensively on the topic. Ronald Grigor Suny, probably the most prominent scholar of the South Caucasus today, also backs up Toumanoff's ideas. This has been disputed by Georgian historians, with the most prominent being Nikoloz Berdzenishvili, who espoused a Georgian-origin for the Bagrationis. While there is no conclusive evidence either way, most mainstream historians accept Toumanoff's theory, which posits that the family came from an individual named Adarnase, who appears sometime in the 780s, and acquired land in Tao-Klarjeti (now part of eastern Turkey/western Georgia), and saw his descendants gain more land and power until they unified the country under David IV, known as David the Builder.
who knows. changing surname suffix is very rare for Georgians. if they do so, it means they don't see themselves as Georgians anymore (for example, Stalin), meanwhile its normal behavior for Armenians. but again, who knows.
It is a topic of debate, and has been heavily influenced by nationalist sentiments in both Armenia and Georgia, who have an ambivalent relationship historically.
But yes, there is strong trend of nationalism in looking at the histories of the peoples in the Caucasus, both on the Armenian and Georgian side (and others, of course). And with the large Armenian diaspora spread around the world they do have a large presence in a lot of places, especially in the US and France, so a lot of people are exposed to their views. But the goal is to try and look past the super nationalist points and try and see things from a more neutral view, which can be difficult at times when dealing with topics like inter-ethnic relations in the Caucasus.
Like a lot of topics on the region, there is a lot of national bickering and historical revisionism, so it can be hard to get accurate details. And while this era is a lot further back than I usually look at, I would suggest looking at Toumanoff's works, as he is still the most authoritative source on the matter, even if he was published 50-60 years ago. For a more accessible history of Georgia, I'd suggest Ronald Grigor Suny's The Making of the Georgian Nation; the first couple chapters cover the topic at hand. You may also want to look at Donald Rayfield's Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia, but I honestly found the book to just be a series of names and dates until about 1800, and thus quite hard to follow.
