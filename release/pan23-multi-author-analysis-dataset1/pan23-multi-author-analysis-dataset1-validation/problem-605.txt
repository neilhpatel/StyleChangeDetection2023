In conjunction with this, the scale of the cosmos got revised upward over time. Anaximander, back in the 500s BCE (and a flat-earther), had come up with a cosmos 27 times wider than the disc of the earth, with the earth suspended in the centre (later thinkers like Anaximenes and Anaxagoras inferred that it must be suspended by air pressure).
That had to change a bit with the switch to the round earth model around 400 BCE, but Anaximander's basic idea was carried over to Plato's and Aristotle's cosmologies: in Plato, with the earth suspended in the centre of the cosmos by sheer isotropy; in Aristotle, by buoyancy/gravity drawing all dense materials towards the centre of the cosmos and expelling light materials towards the edges.
Thanks for your reply. Since you seem to have decent grasp on the subject, perhaps you'd know when was the first times humans started to think that the objects in the sky are actually other planets and stars (or did the concept of star even exist back then?).
> if the earth is round and in the middle of the heavens, it needs neither the air nor any other similar force to keep it from falling, but its own equipoise and the homogeneous nature of the heavens on all sides suffice to hold it in place; for a body which is in equipoise and is placed in the center of something which is homogeneous cannot change its inclination in any direction, but will remain always in the same position.
Thanks, this is really fascinating. I did some cursory googling of isotropy, but only encountered modern physics definitions. I really enjoy hearing about past physical arguments. They're so ingenious, with so little to go on.
And subsequent estimates consistently revised the figure downwards. Archimedes put it at 300,000 stadia (55,500 km); Eratosthenes famously combined a bit of geometry with a bit of geography to come up with the figure of either 250,000 or 252,000 stadia (46,250 or 46,620 km); a geographer around the 1st century CE, possibly Poseidonius but also possibly not, put it at 180,000 stadia (33,300 km), finally coming up with an underestimate. This was all mainstream stuff, especially Aristotle and Eratosthenes.
