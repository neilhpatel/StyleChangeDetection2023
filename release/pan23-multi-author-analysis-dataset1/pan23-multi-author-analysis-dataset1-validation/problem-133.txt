Edit: or how about this one? "Russia plays dangerous game of Czech with 90 year old tanks against US-Dutch lead Furby coalition".
Different doctrinal needs. USSR were preparing for a mad dash across western Europe (7 days to the Rhine) . Fast, smaller tanks that were harder to hit fits into that. NATO planned for preventing said mad dash. So they built large, well armoured tanks that could sit hull down in prepared defensive positions where their size didn't matter all that much, because they would only be exposing the turret front to the approaching enemy.
1.	What do you think will happen to the US economy if China feels empowered enough to strangle or invade Taiwan and all high-end factories will cease to export chips to the US? Further development of advanced economies relies on advanced chips. The strenh of the US response in Ukraine impacts Chinaâ€™s calculus.
From a strategic perspective, everything what is happening is good for the US and bad for China and Russia. Why would you interrupt this?
Edit: With the advent of modern fire control systems, the size of the tank isn't that big of a factor in hitting it, which is probably why the first tank that Russia designed that isn't just an upgrade of Soviet era designs, is a chonk in comparison to Soviet era designs (over 3 ft taller).
2.	Given that China is the real strategic threat to the US, why would the US not do everything they can to weaken Russia and to strenhen the US allies in Europe? This is exactly what is happening: Russia is wrecking their own economy, they will not be paid premium prices for their oil by India and China and have structurally lost European gas customers and tens of billions of USD in revenues per year and Europeans are finally spending more on defense. It means Europe can start taking care of the determent of Russia on their own and the US can fully focus on China. Why do you think Australia and Japan are also significantly contributing in UA?
