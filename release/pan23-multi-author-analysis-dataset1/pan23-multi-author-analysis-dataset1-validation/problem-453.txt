Due to the very nature of imperial expansion, the British could never use a single formula/template for introducing imperial rule across the world. Depending on the territory and its sociopolitical, economic, and even environmental characteristics, the British had to be flexible and adaptive in their approach to implementing colonial policies. Consider for example, the case of South Africa, which I went further into . Due to the fact that the British had strong rivals in the form of the Boer groups and native tribes like the Xhosa, they could not simply impose sweeping laws on the entirety of the region without getting into some form of conflict. Consider also the "jewel in the crown" of the Empire, the British Raj. Here the British East India Company represented the British Empire, and despite attempts in the late 1700s and early 1800s to bring the Company's territory on the Indian subcontinent under London's control, it took until 1857 with the outbreak of the Sepoy Mutiny for the British to firmly gain control of the region (more on that with a great overview by u/conqueror_of_destiny) . Finally, consider the case of the 'white-settler' territories (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and until 1776 the 13 Colonies in America). Here the British gave far more autonomy to the political assemblies, allowing all of them (excluding America once it gained independence) to have some form of Home Rule (that is, a parliamentary system similar in function to Westminster but technically independent of British control).
Hello there! Thank you once again for the splendid reply to yet another question on the British Empire, British Raj and governance in the Empire.
In theory, the British were the political masters of India. In practice, however, they couldn't care less. As long as the taxes were paid.
Following the disaster suffered by the British East India Company after the Sepoy Mutiny, the British government formally took control of their holdings across the subcontinent and reorganised the company's various presidencies and sub-agencies to institute a firmer hand on Indian affairs. Henceforth after the mutiny had been put down violently, the British bureaucracy became the main tool of rule in Empire. To illustrate this rule, let us turn to a source from 1900, when such a system was still in place:
