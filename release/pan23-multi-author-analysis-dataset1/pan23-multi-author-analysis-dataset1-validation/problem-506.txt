Your boyfriend should contact whoever subpoenaed him (probably the prosecutor?) and tell them he is too sick to testify. They should make arrangements for him.
Criminal courts give out Crim subpoenas as in Pennsylvania Code Title 234 - RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE (Rule 100 to Rule 1101) Chapter 1 - SCOPE OF RULES, CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS, LOCAL RULES (Rule 100 to Rule 151) PART A - Business of the Courts (Rule 103 to Rule 119) Rule 107 - Contents of Subpoena.
Thank you! Just wanted to know if this was okay or not. 24 hours just does seem insane though. What would have happened had he not been here? I was going to take him to the hospital a few days ago because his breathing has gotten way worse again. I can’t believe 24 hours is acceptable notice. That’s just crazy to me. That seems extremely unreasonable. But I do thank you for posting and clarifying this for me . I upvoted you. But wow, 24 hours is okay ... that’s just ... like what do people do if they’re out of town or in the hospital? Just get remanded on a bench warrant when they come back?
