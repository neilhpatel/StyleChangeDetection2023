“Ok Dad. You remember those late night infomercials for commemorative plates that come with an “individually numbered certificate of authenticity”? An NFT is buying the certificate. No, you don’t get the plate. But you get a link to a website showing a picture of “your” plate. Yes other people can see your picture. Sure, they could download it. I don’t know why people buy these either. No, I don’t think these pictures make Trump look presidential. Ok. Love you, we’ll see you and Mom at Christmas”.

You just know he has his fingers all over this making terrible design choices and making it look super shitty.
