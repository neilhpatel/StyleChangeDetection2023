Not true, Shell just got sued in the UK by their own shareholders due to not complying with the paris agreement. Money talks, there is still a bit of hope.
I don't really see much hope in this case because it will most likely end up in either Shell telling the court that they are already doing as much as they can, to which the case will be closed with no results, or Shell will receive a small, pity fine they'll pay off within seconds and the money will go absolutely nowhere beneficial, just so the other side can claim they won, and everything returns back to business as usual.
Yep. Just like tobacco companies, “We’ve put warning labels on the product letting the customer know it is their responsibility not to get addicted to our highly addictive drug.”.
Can we? I'm sorry to be Negative Nancy, but considering we are in the late stage of capitalism, I have serious doubts certain people and/or companies can be reached, let alone bothered, with the normal rules anymore. How do you think they got so far in the first place? Hard, honest, clean and moral work? They perfected loopholes. They perfected paying everything and everyone off, one way or another, so they can look the other way or hell: get a slice of the cake themselves. They perfected creating, shaping and manipulating any and all systems in their favor, including the people within and behind them: banks, laws, politics, workers, governments. And not only for a few days. This is the result of decades of preparation and planning. If you or anyone else thinks the normal people have even the slightest chance to harm these entities anymore, you are either naive, dilussional or refuse to accept the reality of the situation.
