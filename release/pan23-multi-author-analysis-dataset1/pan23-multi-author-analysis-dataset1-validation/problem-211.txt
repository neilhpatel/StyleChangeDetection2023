This will be the pivot. Watch conservative shock jocks start to shift support to a quote-unquote winnable candidate in DeSantis. However, what would be really entertaining was a party fracture over this. The Republican party has dogwhistled to the Trumpopulists for too long for this to go over smoothly. The party will want to push with all of their media power to get support for a more run of the mill Republican. Trump's ego will not be able to take this and much of his support base will not accept the pivot. Imagine if Trump runs as an independent/third party candidate, splitting the vote significantly across the entire country delivering the Democrats a strong win in 2024.
Stop upvoting anti-American propagandists. A nice headline doesn't mean they've turned a corner. They still are out to destroy democracy.
