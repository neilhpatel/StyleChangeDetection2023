There are more Joe's and Kirsten's in the party than those who align with the squad. If Dems go down bad tomorrow, the party will place the blame on progressives so they can flush out that rhetoric leading up to the moderate candidate they run in 2024. Their only choice is to reset the party. You are not getting any independents voting for Democratic Socialists. Hate to burst anybody's bubble.
We know that early voters so far are, in terms of demographics: more white, more male, more old, and more rural than in 2018 and 2020, which youâ€™d think would be a good sign for Republicans except for the whole part where Democrats are leading by 4 million even with those demographic changes.
We know that Democrats have a more than 4 million vote lead so far in early voting, which is significantly greater than the percentages at this time in both 2018 and 2020.
We know that the Kansas abortion vote and the five special House races in the last half a year showed Democrats outperforming expectations by 10-20 points each time.
