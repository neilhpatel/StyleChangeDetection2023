I thought about trying to write up my thoughts on Trotsky's and other Marxist definitions of fascism, but was forced to confront the fact that u/commiespaceinvader is . I broadly share their view that Marxist analyses of fascism are important - not least because they actually tried to come to grips with fascism as a theoretical concept in the 1920s and 1930s, decades before anyone else really tried all that hard. However, it's important to note that a class-based analysis has limitations here as well - it explains the reactionary elements of fascism well, but perhaps less the revolutionary elements. I don't think I'm contradicting the linked answer there - I would say that u/commispaceinvader is writing a defence of the usefulness of Marxist scholarship, rather than an assertion of its ability to completely explain all facets of Nazism, but they are welcome to set me straight if I'm wrong there.
So be it. The “nation” as a bourgeois myth may not have appeared to those masses any more distant than “socialism” did – more so after the actual institutions of present day socialism (those cooperatives, associations, unions, etc.) had been thoroughly destroyed – and the instruments of persuasion suggested by Trotsky appear woefully ineffective.
The place where I might be able to help more is with the 'extra credit' (how does that work? should I see you after class?) element of your question. I've written before on the , and the to learn from these issues after 1933, though there's perhaps more to be said about the substantive differences between the Comintern's 'Popular Front' policy and Trotsky's proposed 'United Front'. I'll even throw in this other about what 'worked' in terms of confronting interwar fascism.
For many of those socialist organizations, cooperatives, administrations, the ability to provide a modicum of material satisfaction to the needs of their social base relied on the maintenance of a delicate balance with the government, the liberal establishment, the agrarian and industrial owners, the public authority – once this balance was compromised, ideological factors aside, the socialist movement was just as inept to provide those guarantees as any other.
I would disagree? While you can undoubtedly reconcile some aspects of totalitarian approaches to fascism with Marxist approaches, the fundamental purpose of each analysis is very different. Arendt and other scholars of totalitarianism take fascist ideology as their primary focus, whereas Marxist scholars argue that the ideas of fascism were primarily a facade for their true purpose of maintaining class systems by force. Just as I would argue that Marxist understandings of fascism wilfully neglect its revolutionary aspects, so too does totalitarianism neglect fascism's reactionary conservatism. The underlying political purposes (conflating fascism with Stalinism, or conflating fascism with capitalism) are also quite different, and the enduring popularity of each school of thought owes more than a little to their 'usefulness' in a Cold War context.
Yet, I feel I may have something to say about this one. At least in so far as the points which relate to Italian Fascism in particular – which is to say, those I feel I can address more properly – and, accounting for the fact that the value and significance of Marxist historiography for the interpretation of Fascism (points that I have no intention to dispute) has already been covered, I suppose I can spend a few words on the specific contributions you linked.
I will, of course, attempt to substantiate this argument with a brief (well...) examination of both texts – according to chronological order – where I try to highlight the main issues I have with them, and especially with their characterization of Italian Fascism.
But in both Trotzsky and Zetkin any concrete analysis of the Italian situation, of the very character, feelings, ideas and even material condition of the Italian proletariat – of the Italian masses – which is a necessary precondition to an examination of their role in the affirmation of Fascism, is absent. Impossible, one may say, given the very limited information available to them (a fact which didn't prevent them both from discussing it at will). Even the “nation” only appears in its most “orthodox” and superficial character, as a great “other”, the incarnation of the dominant class. As Zetkin wrote in her conclusions:
Trotsky's analysis was that this was foolish, calling for a 'United Front' of working class parties against fascism, criticising both socialists and communists for failing to see that this was where their mutual interests lay - even if socialists had enabled fascism by constraining proletarian revolution after the First World War, they had to now see that their interests aligned with the revolutionary left, given the choice between revolution or fascism. Equally, communists needed to turn towards building this alliance, rather than hastening the downfall of bourgeois democracy in the expectation that this would provide them with their opening.
