Of course, the investors had to pay the merchandise, the losses, insurance etc. but to quote the linked text:
That is absolutely remarkable. The profits were enormous. Were there large fleets owned by a single owner or company? They would have gotten very wealthy.
In the same appendix tables, we can see that even in outgoing voyages, when ships didn't carry spices but normal merchandise and money like silver, the value of the cargo was the same or at least near the value of the equipping of the ship, so even the normal value would be roughly equal in worth with cargo.
But just to showcase the great disparity in values when spices were involved, according to one , when English in 1592 captured the Portuguese carrack Madre Deus returning laden with spices, they estimated the value of the cargo brought back in port at £150,000 at the time, and that's after large part of the cargo had been looted before arrival (estimated initial value was around £500,000).
Sorry for the slew of questions. My mind is racing with possibilities. A young and interested man with a few moderately wealthy friends seems like he could have become immensely rich with a few of these voyages, as long as the weather held and they made it home.
