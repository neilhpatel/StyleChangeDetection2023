You bought this in good faith and without claims from the treasury, insurance company or original owner at time of purchase. The insurance company would have to settle the claim with the state treasury, if they were to pursue anything. Without knowing what the document says you won't get much specific help, and a short consultation with an attorney may be in your best interest if you want a definitive and expert answer.
Yes. That section of the code says what it says. You receive title to the property, free of all claims "of the owner." And, "owner" is defined in 447.503(9) as including "any person having a legal or equitable interest in property subject to \[the Uniform Distribution of Unclaimed Property Act\]" The insurance company might have had an interest in the property, BUT the sale by the state to you extinguished that interest.
If this was anything else, I would agree. Rolex also keeps the S/N's indexed and will not repair or sell parts for a watch if it is reported stolen. It's probably in OPs best interest to get this resolved so the watch is nolonger blacklisted if it ever needs maintenance.
