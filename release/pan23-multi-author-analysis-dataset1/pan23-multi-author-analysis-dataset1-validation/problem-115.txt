A light? What does having a light on do? Is the place run on power source that is that expensive or limited? The power to the cameras probably comes from the same source. I'm trying to understand.
She's hysterically paranoid. She checked the camera when she left to go to Tennessee and it was on and she knew 100% that she didn't leave it on, so she said she would call an officer over to check out the house. I went to my cameras and showed her the footage of her leaving it on....
While I sympathize greatly with landlords in a lot of situations, you have to take the responsibility here of educating yourself on the regulations to understand what you can and can’t do; what’s reasonable/unreasonable; and your legal remedies if something goes wrong. Chalk this up to a learning experience. I’m not sure about this light argument, but if you are worried about a few dollars in utilities then you’re really in the wrong game. You should invest in programmable switches if you’re set on this and/or have the next tenant chip in on utilities. Regardless of who started it, something that insignificant should never become an argument between two people.
Tennessee... It was a nice place and had some friendly people I worked with, but I had bad allergies there. I'm not sure what an officer could do about a light being left on and camera footage showing she did it unless the video feed had signs it was altered. I doubt a police officer would need to enter a house to figure out if video was altered.
