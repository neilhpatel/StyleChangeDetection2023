A lot of parents of new teen drivers fail to report that junior picked up a license to their insurance company, because their premiums will more than double.
If kids aren’t listed on the policy; most insurance companies will still pay the claim for the accident. They may go back and charge the parents the avoided premium payments, raise up the rates in response, or refuse to renew the policy, but it’s rare that they will outright deny coverage. However, They can also accuse a policyholder of fraud or misrepresentation and breach of the policy requirements and refuse to pay, which is more likely after bigger accidents.
IANAL. The mom should have uninsured on her insurance or have the daughter listed as a driver on the insurance. I'd definitely go for the insurance on mom's side but definitely be prepared to go to small claims court on the daughter and hopefully your insurance can go after the mother. If you received any injuries, get any ambulance bills, hospital bills, any doctor notes, lost days of work, etc.
