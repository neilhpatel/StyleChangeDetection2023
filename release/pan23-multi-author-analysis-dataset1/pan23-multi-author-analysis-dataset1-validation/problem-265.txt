Also the almost symbiotic relationship between the New England colonies and the English West Indies. The Caribbean colonies allowed the stimulus and output for developing industries such as shipping, distilling and shipbuilding where New England came to compete with the mothercountry due to its vast timber resources. All these further promoted economic growth and therefore population increase.
This allowed exponential growth when combined with a constant supply of immigrants. The population of Europe was rapidly growing due to the Columbian exchange which allowed many previous infertile or impractical areas to be farmed. The population of Ireland for example grew massively due to the introduction of the potato, but was then vulnerable when faced with a widespread blight of the crop (this was often seen in pre-Columbian native American populations where populations would collapse due successive crop failures).
Thanks for the answer! As another side question, how significant was the impact caused to population growth by immigration from places other than the British Isles?
