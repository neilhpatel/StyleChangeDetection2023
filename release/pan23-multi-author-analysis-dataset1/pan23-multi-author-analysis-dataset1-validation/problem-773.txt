Definitely a bunch of negative responses from people who didn't read the article. They are projecting that electricity production from renewables will go from 29% to 35%, and therefore surpass coal, if you combine all renewables together.
Worse. They have lignite coal energy in their solar reports. Any time they switch over it takes 24 hours to shut the coal down, but they count the entire day as green. Scandalous Hollywood style accounting.
You don't get there over night. The work being done now is progress, it's how you get to the point you're discussing. You can't get to that point without the current work, which means the current work is progress toward that goal. Babies make seemingly sporadic and futile progress on crawling until one day they just crawl - but that's not the day they learned to crawl, they worked on it for months.
Ecologically "renewables" are a fucking disaster. The waste stream for PV for example is seventeen times larger than nuclear. And it only works during the day, when it's sunny. Oh, and the toxic waste products, many of them remain toxic forever. Unlike nuclear waste which eventually becomes non hazardous. Yes, the time scales are stupid long, but at least they end eventually. Solar and wind have not been successful in pushing coal out of the electricity market. See Germany. Nuclear has. Yet the "green" advocates have a fit when it's suggested.
