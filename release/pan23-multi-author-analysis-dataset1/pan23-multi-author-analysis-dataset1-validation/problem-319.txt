Third (possible) syncretism: One of my favorite minor test cases of Roman syncretism on this question concerns an issue which you'll see all over the place: Did Christians get Christmas from Sol Invictus or the other way around? Recent scholarship has directly problematized both sides of the debate on whether Sol Invictus or Christmas had the first claim to December 25. Aurelian may have been responding to the rising popularity of Christianity, or Christians may have responded to Aurelian's institution of the feast, or maybe an interest in the winter solstice as a symbol was just in the air around then, and both sides developed it from a common interest at the time.
Could please provide more of your sources? I just stumbled upon your answer which I noticed was written with a lot of care for the subject and I'm currently writing my paper myself (about the religious tolerance of the Romans), so it'd help me a lot in finding good sources in English since my native language seems to lack rather detailed ones. Thanks in advance.
TL;DR: The short version of this is that syncretism usually worked locally, only after military conquest of a new people in a single place; that through the early centuries, Romans did not see Christians as a people to be reckoned with but a troublesome sliver of a minority which acted seditiously; and that while there are examples of syncretism, they existed according to their mental framework about what they thought Christians even were. However, more important than syncretism would be the difficulty of reconciling Christian claims into the Roman mindset. Among these were the former Christian Celsus' attempt at a philosophical refutation of Christianity and what became called, by the Great Church tradition, heresies. By the time Christians were a large enough population to care about, they were largely not considered disruptive to social order.
