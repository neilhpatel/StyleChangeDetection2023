Finally, Operation Zapata (1961) was originally begun under President Dwight D. Eisenhower and then fell largely into Kennedy's lap as a fait accompli which he then tweaked. He could have gone back on it, but doing so would have made him seem weak on Communism, so in order to avoid the domestic political cost of calling it off, he tweaked it multiple times in his first months in office, including insisting that the US military would not be spearheading the invasion invasion itself, that it had to be by Cuban exiles. What happened and why, what the different players in this mess assumed would happen, etc., is still debated, but Piero Gleijeses makes a strong argument in his article Ships in the Night: The CIA, the White House and the Bay of Pigs for the read that in addition to assuming Kennedy would buckle, nobody really thought through what was supposed to happen after the initial invasion. The shift of invasion site from Northern Cuba near a major town to the middle of the Zapata Swamp, for example, made the invasion way easier, but the backup plan for the force to flee to the Escambray mountains (where there was still armed peasant resistance to the government) now no longer made sense because it would have involved a long trek East across choke points the Cuban government could easily take ahead of time. Another issue was that the initial air raid that was supposed to take out the whole Cuban air force, giving the invasion the air superiority it desperately needed, failed to get all of it, and failed to come back in time to clean up what had survived the initial bombing run. In short, a bunch of unforced errors.
One thing I'm curious about: Is there a plausible case that some of these "tweaks" may have been a case of the operation being deliberately "set up for failure," sabotaged or undermined from within because it would have been politically inexpedient to directly oppose it -- whether by Kennedy himself or someone within the administration? I realize this sounds a bit conspiratorial, but we're already in murky waters to begin with, and I wanted to know if that possibility is taken seriously.
How can you say this? That’s basically unknowable no? If the US ended its occupation of Guantanamo Bay, the blockade and campaigns to overthrow the government, why couldn’t Cuba have been moderately successful as a state?
