A week? I live in Chicago but work in the burbs so I always gas up by work to avoid Chicago tax. It went from $2.99 to $3.59 overnight in the burbs. It went from $3.59 in the city to over $4.
Disgraceful. After nut-cases like Trump, Bobo, MTG, Gaetz, Lake & Santos I will never, ever vote for a single Republican again. I used to vote Republican, almost straight ticket. But never again. If I don't like the Dem I've been voting third party. The GOP has turned into a circus of reality tv scripted clowns, attention-seeking whiners, nutty white Christian Nationalists & outright Nazis, whack-jobs repeating conspiracy theories, and a mainstay of corrupt & corporate-owned amoral degenerates regurgitating childish talking points and voting for whatever they are paid to do. (The Dems have a large portion of this last group too). Republicans have lost me for life, and I know I'm not the only one. Never again!
To my understanding, our strategic reserves are there for several obvious reasons, national emergencies, disaster to another provider/source, war time, and any other threat to our security. Selling oil for profit isn't one. The president could order the release of the supply to the nation, sustaining the nation for 2 yrs and the military for approx 6 years if rationed to select units. It's not there to ease prices. That (prices) is controlled by private companies and buyers and sellers of petroleum stocks. Corporate profits (greed) during a pandemic are at an all-time high. Has jack shit to do with who's president. Supply actually outweighed demand during the pandemic because much fewer gallons of petrol were consumed privately and publicly. MGT was doomed to fail because basically... she's a treasonous Dumbass. Embarrassing, she is on the Homeland Security Committee. Hope she can protect us from the Israeli space lazers.
