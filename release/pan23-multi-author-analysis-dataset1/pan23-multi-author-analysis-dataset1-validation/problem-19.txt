...Right as he is massively embroiled in new corruption scandals yet again with Zahawi and Sharp, but now his usual routine of running to Ukraine for a headline won't work after Zelenskyy said following the last time that he doesn't support him and wouldn't even want him as an ambassador.
But he was massively in their pockets before. Even he wouldn't be stupid enough to side with Russia going into the war. He just enjoyed the donations up to that point. Slimeballs all of them.
There's no official record of it being said from what was released at the time by either side, despite Russia casually threatening nukes and attacks on everyone and anyone over the last year, including the UK.
Yep, and? That doesn't negate what I said, just adds that they are claiming both that it's a lie and might not be a lie.
