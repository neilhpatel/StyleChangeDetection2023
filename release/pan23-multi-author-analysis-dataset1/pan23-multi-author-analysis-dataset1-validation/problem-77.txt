This will almost absolutely 100% not go the way you plan. You MOST LIKELY will end up sitting in a jail cell at the mercy of the DA and the court. This is absolutely last resort territory.
Would he be able to get a pfj? Is that still a thing in NC (was a guest of Davidson Co NC many years ago. My Uncle (the Sheriff at the time) took me into custodyðŸ˜³ I was able to get a PFJ after having not gotten into further trouble after a year. (Driving on Revoked).
In any case, you WILL need a lawyer and I would highly recommend reaching out to the Legal Aid Society or Googling other non-profit legal help avenues, including in-state legal resources, especially those tied to law schools since they can offer student law help that can help you do some legwork yourself if you don't have money to offer for a full legal resource.
Oh, baby. Sweet baby. The way the system is backed up, they might sit on hou for several YEARS before the DA gets around to dealing with your 15 year old cold case. It's not likely going to be anyone's priority except your own.
