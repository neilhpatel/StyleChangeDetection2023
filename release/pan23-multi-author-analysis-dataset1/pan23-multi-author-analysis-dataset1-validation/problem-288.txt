Leo Gross graduated from the University of Vienna to study international law, political science, and economics at the London School of Economics, Columbia University, and Harvard University where he earned his doctorate in 1931. He then returned to Europe and studied in Germany, but was forced to leave after the National Socialists took power due to his Jewish ancestry. He moved to Paris in 1935 to work at an arm of the League of Nations and as the manager of the Department of International Relations until 1940, when he fled to the US due to World War II. He then worked as a professor and taught internationally, becoming an adviser to the U.S. State Department and the United Nations. Leo Gross is a huge name in International Relations, and this post is not to discredit his numerous contributions to IR, but rather to show the dangers of presenting history without understanding the nuances, factors, and struggles involved.
Ok. So what I think I’m understanding is that guys like Osiander and Gross, writing from a just post world war 2 perspective, cast Westphalia as resulting in absolutist states with bellicose foreign policies obsessing with natural borders. Basically trying to draw a straight line from the international system they think Westphalia created to World War 1, and thus, the disaster they just lived through. This totally skips some very important stuff—say, you know, the French Revolution.
Osiander, Andreas. “Sovereignty, International Relations, and the Westphalian Myth.” International Organization 55, no. 2 (2001): 251–87.
Edit: this also imagines Denmark, Sweden, France, and potentially the Palatinate as banding together as internationalist defenders of a sort of “balance of power” dynamic, trying to hold back the Hapsburg hegemon, which...I see how you get there, but that’s anachronistic and ignores the other, more important motivations at play.
Just Leo Gross. Andreas Osiander argues against Westphalia creating absolutist states and sovereignty. Instead, he takes a far more historical approach to point out the numerous nuances in the conflict of the Thirty Years' War that render conclusive statements (rise of Absolutism, sovereignty, and balance of power) about the Peace of Westphalia gross misunderstandings of the final documents.
Great! Thanks for taking the time to engage, I feel like I’ve got a much better rough understanding of the historiography here now. And good call on not cavalierly throwing religion itself as a cause of the 30YW, I should exercise some discipline there.
