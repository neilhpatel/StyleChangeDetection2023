Putin joined the KGB in 1975, and in 1985 he was posted to their office in Dresden, East Germany, where he stayed until 1990 when East Germany ceased to exist. He returned to Leningrad (his hometown; now Saint Petersburg) and started working with Anatoli Sobchuk, who was the mayor of the city. Working as an international advisor, Putin took a leading role in ensuring the city stayed stocked with basic foodstuffs and other materials, in a time when the USSR was facing massive shortages. There are rumours that Putin took illegal measures at this time to both ensure delivery and keep himself well-off, and he was investigated by a branch of the city, but nothing has ever been confirmed (a recurring theme in the life of Putin).
Very interesting. I was imagining it happened in a more spy movie way, in truth it seems like the rise of any politician luckier than average. It's incredible how fast he rose! Of course, it can't be just luck, but you get what I mean.
Lastly, I'll note Putin himself released an autobiography shortly after becoming President in 2000: in English it is called First Person: An Astonishingly Frank Self-Portrait by Russia's President Vladimir Putin. Obviously it is not an impartial look at Putin, but it does look at his rise, and gives his own perspective.
The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin by Steven Lee Myers (2015, 2016) is probably the best one out there. He looks at Putin, but also a broader look at 1990s Russia, and is fairly impartial in his analysis.
