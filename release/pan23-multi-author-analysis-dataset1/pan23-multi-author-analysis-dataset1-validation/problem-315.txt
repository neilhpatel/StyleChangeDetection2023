You have her personal emotional advice. There are other subs for that and your amateur advice to mothers of abuse victims.
If someone knew my child was being abused and did not tell me? Usurped my responsibility to protect my own child and left them in danger?
The parents have legal rights AND OBLIGATIONS in these cases. You’ve not referenced HIPPA (you are indeed ignoring it to be a judge), you’ve skipped mandatory reporting and parents rights repeatedly, ignored clinical advice and caution, and you have run rough shod over the near certainty that a 14-year old girl will not be able to handle this on her own - let me introduce you to the people the know the victim, that care about the victim, and are legally obligated to provide assistance to the MANDATORY REPORT of child sexual abuse: the parents.
Honestly I don’t agree in the slightest. I think it sounds like mom is engaging all the correct people- a therapist, CPS, the police. The doctor is the one who is failing the daughter as a mandated reporter. There is absolutely nothing controlling about wanting there to be consequences for your child being abused. I agree there are HIPPA issues but there is not control issues for calling the police on your underaged child’s abuser.
