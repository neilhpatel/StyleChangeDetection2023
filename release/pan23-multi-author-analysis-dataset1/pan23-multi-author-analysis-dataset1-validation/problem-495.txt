The Russian dead reached about 1000 per day recently. That means 4000-5000 per day casualties (or maybe only 3000 if you trust Ukraine about how bad Russian medicine is). This is before Russia begins any big attack which would open them to casualties much much bigger than the Ukrainian ones, so it means that we may reach 10k per day within weeks or months. Even if Russia goes for a maximal 10million mobilization, that puts them at 30% total casualty rate of their young men within a year and within two would basically end the Russian nation.
Absolutely. That decision is up to the Ukrainians and right now they seem rather busy defending their country from an invading genocidal army.
Insist on verification. Inspections by Ukraine and international peace keepers would probably be wise.
Otherwise. Total war is preferable. Stopping before those conditions are met is a guarantee of future Russian aggression.
Their entire history has been dealing with Russian occupation. I know damn well that most of them given the choice, would continue to fight no matter what.
