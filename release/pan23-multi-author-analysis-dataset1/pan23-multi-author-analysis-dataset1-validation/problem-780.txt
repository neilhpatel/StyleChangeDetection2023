I live in PA, and although it’s not the same situation, I had a foster sister that would have been way worse off with her biological father (our social worker and child advocate acknowledged this) but they do everything in their power to keep the child united with its parent. My sister almost had to go stay with her mother in jail after living with us from birth to two years old. Although a grandparent is still a relative, I do not see it taking precedence over an actual parent, especially one that has cared for the child for years. Also we were always reminded decisions were made in the best interest of the child and I don’t think it would be the best interest to completely uproot your daughter away from the father that’s been raising her for years. This is not totally legal advice, but just some reassurance that the grandmother would probably need extremely good lawyers to gain full custody. It’d be best if you got a lawyer as well because they would know the ins and outs and will absolutely make the process easier.
Additionally, don't panic. It is very, very difficult for a non-parent to get custody from a parent as they would have to prove that your child is being abused or neglected and it doesn't sound like that's the case at all. Even in the absence of a parenting plan or other court order. They can try, but it's going to take a lot of effort and convincing evidence for them to convince the court to take a child from their natural parent.
