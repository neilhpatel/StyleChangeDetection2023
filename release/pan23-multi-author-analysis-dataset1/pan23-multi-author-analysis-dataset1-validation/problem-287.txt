I'm an addict in recovery, so I speak from a place of personal experience when I discuss the power the disease of addiction has over those still suffering. When in long-term, active addiction, you completely lose any ability to consider the possibility of consequences, and with the understanding of this, it is innappropiate to charge anyone for their actions when inebriated, and doing so is very much so cruel.
The system at present doesn't care about the mother. The system right now is 100% about the child and the child's rights, as the completely innocent party. The best interest of the child will always be the system's priority. No system is perfect but that's a perfect philosophy. I truly hope your sister gets help.
The current system has no benefit to even her daughter (which they claim that children's welfare is their motivation behind their sadism towards those they victimize), because if they allowed for my sister, or anyone in a similar situation to find recovery, and get custody of her child back, that would be in the best interest of her well being, for the simple reason that children are better off in their mother's care, and this is true for any custody situation involving drug addiction.
Edit: It looks like your recovery is slipping. You may want to seek help. And stay out of the reddit drug use groups. That is likely not helpful to your recovery. Good luck.
There's literally no point in discussing this with you because of how narrow minded you are, you are so interested in simplifying a complex situation that you want to leave drug use out of discussion "forget drugs...", when drug use is literally the entirety of the situation. I could go on and refute everything you're saying with logical thinking and the ability to comprehend complex situations, but there's no point if you genuinely believe that the system has any sort of philosophy guiding the actions of the bureaucrats, and that it involves protecting anyone at that.
She wasnt just caught with drugs. She was trafficking's drugs. So this isnt a simple drug addict taken into custody.
