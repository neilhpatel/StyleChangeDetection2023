This is because we've allowed the plutocrats to shift the tax burden away from their businesses (after all they're "job creators, aren't they?) And themselves and onto the American middle class.
I'm what's left of the American middle class. I pay my taxes, and in some cases, more than presidents, CEOs, and, most politicians. The American middle class dies with my generation, and yet, more people seem concerned with what pronouns other people prefer, than what happens when an economy built on consumption no longer has consumers who can afford to consume.
That is confirmed. $5.4M. But tax payments and tax refunds are irrelevant. The refund is due to a large estimated tax payment in a previous year. What matters us your tax liability due each year.
Because the tax returns state how much estimated taxes he paid. Lying about estimated tax payments would absolutely not be part of any tax fraud you linked.
