In addition to the thread already linked by u/kdfsjljklgjfg, I would also like to highlight my older answer , which explains why some modern scholars (including the world's most prominent authority on Sparta) believe that Sparta wasn't really all that militarised to begin with. When we look at Sparta, we're not looking at a society that minmaxed on militarism but didn't get the expected result. We're actually looking at a fairly ordinary Greek society that was the subject of much myth-making by outsiders because of a few notable achievements (mainly internal political stability). I cannot speak for all of history, but my baseline assumption is that something similar will apply to other societies that have traditionally been pigeonholed as "military cultures". Did such cultures ever really exist?
regional power into a formidable military machine and the eventual unifier of All-under-Heaven. From the Warring States-period texts, we may discern immense hatred of post-reform Qin, but also considerable appreciation of its successes, as even expressed by critics like Xunzi.
I would echo the other flares. It's highly doubtful a large society which banned most/all "cultural" pursuits in favour of "martial" ones ever even existed.
