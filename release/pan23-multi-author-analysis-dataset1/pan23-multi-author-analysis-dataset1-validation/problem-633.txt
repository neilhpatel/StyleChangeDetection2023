Thank you. This headline is needlessly antagonistic about a problem we realistically can’t solve outside of regime change, which, you know, literally never goes down successfully.
Right? The Iranian government didn't say, "quick, execute the protestors now while it's Christmas time!" Sure, the "official" executions only just started, but their government has been unofficially executing protestors (read: just fucking murdering them in the streets) since September. What the fuck am I supposed to be doing about it??
Beyond it not being the West’s fuckin job, we all know the moment we did try to that their leadership will tell all the Iranian’s “they’re trying to destroy Islam” and they’d turn on us bc so many of them are as fucking stupid as conservative Trump lovers who were brainwashed into thinking their fundamentals are under attack when they’re not, at all.
Distracted? TF we supposed to do? We already get memed for the wars on terrorism. Not our problem, so don't expect a response. They live with 14th century rules, their people should take up arms and fix it themselves.
