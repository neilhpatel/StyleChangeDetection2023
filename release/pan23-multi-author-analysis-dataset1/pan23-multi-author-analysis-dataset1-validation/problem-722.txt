Your very simple question has quite a long and comolicated 2 part answer. First lets cover what france actually did during ww2 then how it was tought in the US and France.
When talking about the French contributions it is important to remember there are two phases to the french peoples actions during ww2.
(Again glossing over the post war french period. It actually took around a decade for the french to get this sentiment across while reorganizing their political system. The french finaly succeded in reforming into the fifth french republic in 1958 under Charles de Gaulle in which he was able to finally minimize the contribution of the french resistance especially its communist elements. He was also able to culturally blend the free french and french resistance to such a point that some schools make no distictions between the two. Meanwhile in the US the second world war had been turned into a story in which the US single handedly saved the world with little to no allied powers mentioned in US classes or history books.).
I wanted to add that Charles De Gaulle was a very proud man, and the reason why he was seen by the allies as ungrateful was because he was trying to be seen by France as a leader of and for a free France and not as a puppet of the UK and the US, that is how/why he got his attitude.
