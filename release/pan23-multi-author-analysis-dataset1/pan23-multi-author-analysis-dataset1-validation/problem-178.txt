And manufactures and retailers were just about to press the “inflation increase” button on their products until they learned this important fact. But they went ahead and did it anyway because why not.
Egypt started an 8b usd project in 2014 to widen the Suez Canal in places, and as of August 2015 twenty two miles of it can have ships passing in opposite directions with the option for two counter sailing ships to stop at the edges and allow a third to overtake them both through the middle.
Ahh. Yeah, I defiantly wouldn't have gotten that reference. I was more referring to the large container ship that blocked the canal for a long time and caused international chaos. I am sure you know what I'm referring too. I've only watched the movie but have never read the book series. Is it a good read?
The Suez Cannal Authority are about as corrupt as you get while fulfilling the obligations of maintaining and operationing globally critical infrastructure. Maritime shipping in general is a black hole of corruption but Egypt knows it's got shipping by the balls for the region. They'll happily try and wring as much cash or goods out of you as they can get away with.
