They probably issued you a CP-2000 which means you did not report all of your income. You can file an amended return or a return if you have not filed at all. Make sure to include that income and all of the expenses on a Schedule C. The IRS is really backed up now so communication is very important. Go see tax pro and do as i laid out and make sure you cover the same with the state you were in at the time. Let the IRS know that you are working on fixing it and give them a deadline and have them out a collection hold on the account. Also be very nice to the agent, they are over worked and will help you out and maybe offer good ideas if you are nice, be a jerk with them and they may not be as helpful. Do not let this go unanswered.
There are instructions on the website on how to file a document with the IRS (typically one of their tax return documents, of varying complexity depending on your circumstance) describing what income you received during the year and how much tax you estimate that you owe. Most single people in the US making income over $12K are actually required to file one anually.
