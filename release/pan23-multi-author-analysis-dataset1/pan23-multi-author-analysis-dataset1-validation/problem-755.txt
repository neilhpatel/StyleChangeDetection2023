Workplaces aren't places for dialog, generally speaking. They are not a friend group. They are not a family. They are places to work. And you're also discovering that this world is far more diverse in opinion that you might have realized. Actually not opinion exactly, but perspective and interpretation. Your logical process is not shared by most, nor is mine, nor is anyone's. I own firearms, I have read the manifesto, and I would never discuss either at work, any more than I'd discuss my personal taxes or medical conditions. Whatever you say at work is broadcast to an incredibly diverse audience. In some workplaces if you'd said "I love vaccines Biden is great" you'd have gotten fired. The biggest rule for working is "respect everyone and respectfully ignore everyone's opinion; do not engage.".
The fact that they couched your termination in terms of not fitting into the company's core values or that they said that one or more employees may have been made uncomfortable by you is irrelevant. Unlike a court of law you don't have a right to face your accusers or to demand that there be a preponderance of evidence against you or for your employer to prove that you are a clear and present danger or anything like that. You weren't discriminated against in any legally relevant way.
