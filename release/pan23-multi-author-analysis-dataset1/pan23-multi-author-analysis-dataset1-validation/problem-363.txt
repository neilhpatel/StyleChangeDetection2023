Midwives, for example, were mostly still women in the Middle Ages. Of course, healers' specialties were overlapping, so it's not like a barber would never serve as a midwife, and there's one awesome case where a woman noted in tax records as a midwife is the sort of 'official' medical practitioner at a men's monastery. (So either she had a broader skillset, or there were some very unmonastic things up in that monastery.).
There are specific situations where sacraments are illicit but still valid, mostly relating to defrocked or excommunicated priests, but there is no general rule that non-priests can perform sacraments otherwise reserved to the priesthood. See for example Canon 900 ยง1:
Although her focus is a bit narrower, Caroline Walker Bynum's magnum opus Christian Materiality points out what I think is the core underlying orientation of medieval Christianity that points it away from modern, sanitized/spiritualized/textualized interpretations. Medieval Christians believed in a MUCH closer relationship between the natural and supernatural worlds than we do today, specifically, the ability of physical matter to be moved by God and to move God. In a sense, this could be seen as a truer interpretation of Christianity, a religion that turns on the belief that the physical suffering and death of Jesus on the cross leading, ultimately, to his return to physical life had the metaphysical or spiritual effect of saving people's immaterial souls.
Ok, that may be a bit flippant. But there's a Benedictine monastery in easy driving reach of me, and I've been known to join the Office once or twice.
Obviously, these are all generalized and prescriptive situations. In practice, women were individuals and, if they had the ability, could and did change things up as they wanted. Queen Eleanor [not of Aquitaine] and King Henry III of England insisted that he be able to stay in France with her until she had given birth. Matilda of Saxony, on the other hand, insisted on traveling to the current residence of her father, King Henry II (the famous one), when she was nearing time to give birth to two of her children. Women who had the chance to decide what would help keep them comfortable, did so.
