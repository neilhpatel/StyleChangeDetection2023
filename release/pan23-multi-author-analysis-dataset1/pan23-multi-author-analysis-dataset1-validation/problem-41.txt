Thank you! That helps a lot, they probably are not discussing it until it becomes more of an issue and since it is a few years away. It is also a small company so I am not sure if they get any protections from having a certain amount of employees. Illinois is the state by the way.
Salary has no inherent changes, it's all about federal and state exemptions (learned professional, executive, administrative, computer employee, etc). Most of those do require you be paid on a salary basis, but not all of them. The majority of the valid exemptions cover both overtime and minimum wage, but there are some niche ones that are just one or the other. But yeah, your effective hourly rate as an exempt employee could indeed be less than the minimum wage.
That said, you don't make enough given that annual income to be exempt for the main federal exemptions ($684/week), assuming you work at least 43 weeks a year. Your state probably has a different one as well. Your employer would be liable for the difference, and for any overtime in that case.
