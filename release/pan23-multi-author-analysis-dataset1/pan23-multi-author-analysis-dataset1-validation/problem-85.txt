If the car is a total loss and you scrap it, you can end the insurance and won't owe monthly premiums anymore. Talk to your folks and your insurance agent about the increase in insurance costs, and whether you should have a non-owner policy if you give up driving for a while in order to show continuous insurance, or to cover you when renting cars.
Alright, thank you. And yeah we’ve already made the claim and it’ll all be sorted out next week hopefully obviously not over the weekend, I’ll just pay whatever I’m fined and anything insurance requires me to pay, other than that they should have everything under wraps.
Take a deep breath and calm down. It's just an accident. You're gonna be ok. The family can't press charges. You aren't going to jail. Accidents happen thousands of times a day. If your insurance company deems you at fault, they will pay out the other party's damages up to your policy limits. If you carry collison on your policy they compensate you for the value of your car minus your deductible. If you're going to replace your car relatively quickly, don't cancel your insurance or you'll be paying higher rates due to a lapse in coverage.
