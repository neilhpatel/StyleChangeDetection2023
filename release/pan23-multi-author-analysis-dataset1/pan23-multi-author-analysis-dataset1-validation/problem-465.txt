Lol not to sound rude, but it's difficult to see that happen. 1. Taiwan has like universal healthcare for "EVERYONE", I don't think the GOP would want that. 2. Taiwan has 25 million people, if they join the US, would entirely shift the balance of power. 3. If US not only support Taiwan independence, but also absorb it into the union. It kinda force the CCP to declare war lol. Don't get me wrong, I support Taiwan democracy 100%, but Taiwan as a state is further than having the Philippine as the 51st state which is further than having Puerto Rico as the 51st state which is further than having DC statehood.
You think Biden has a clue? Please, you’re a doctor. I know you have friends who you think are dumb as shit and have plenty of influence/power or whatever you’d like to call it. Biden used his charisma, influence and connections to get where he is. Just like most politicians. Doesn’t mean he makes good decisions. Honestly I don’t know how you could be associated with either party as a higher ranking person and make good decisions. Too much influence from the money.
Taiwan is strategically located. It can either act as a thorn on China's side or the doorway into the Pacific for China.
