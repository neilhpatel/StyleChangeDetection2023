Remember the good ol days when the most hated Republicans were the ones screaming the loudest about balancing the budget and fiscal responsibility? I miss those days.
Furthermore, some of those Republicans who play the long game may be welcoming of giving up Republican power before a presidential election. If Republicans actually control one House, then if things go poorly in the next few years, Dems can muddy the waters about who deserves the blame. If things go poorly while Dems control the House, Senate and presidency, then Republicans can squarely place the blame on them. If things go well while Republicans only control the House, then Dems will get all the credit. If things go well while Dems control all 3 Houses then you'd think Dems would get all the credit then too. But, if Dems control the House because of the 5 Republican defection, then Republicans can take some credit for things being good.
