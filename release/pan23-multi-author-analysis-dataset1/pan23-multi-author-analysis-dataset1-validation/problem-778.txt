If the morality police men have a problem looking at women without a stupid religious hat, they should wear a blindfold so that they remain "pure." But I guess that would inconvenience them.
Some tribes (religions, nations, even friend cliques) collectively try to build upon/reinforce another value stack off/within the individuals, while creating identity elements from the ingroup/outgroup divide. Overcoming this tribalism requires deliberate mental practice.
Can there ever be more? I think at best we can push the boundary for what is an ultimate "value" and what is just instrumental, letting us derive the instrumental stuff from a more "pure" idea of values. But in the end there will always be a subjective basis.
I can evaluate a "stack" based on my own subjective opinion. In a community, we can do that together and create an aggregated evaluation in the form of laws and norms. Do we need more?
1. giving up on morals/judgements/values imposed to you from your environment (parents/religion/society/...).
Kind of getting into N's Last Man (men?) morals VS values. (Did N in the end say modernity will kill values, and nothing will matter?).
You CAN kill regime leaders and do intervention wars to save people from acute suffering - but this WILL backfire, since there always are collateral damages in warfare, and people will forget you helped them and power-hungry populists will only point at the innocent victims to increase hate over time.
Without the common set (morals?) how do you compare and measure the value stacks? Maybe yours isn't the right one. Is there a right one? Who are you to judge others stacks?
