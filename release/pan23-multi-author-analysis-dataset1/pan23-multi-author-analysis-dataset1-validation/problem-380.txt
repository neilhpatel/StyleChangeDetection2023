PR,,, and he could be hog food and the Russian spinning the entire spiel. He's possibly a puppet, staging the attempts and choreographed persecution to install a next puppet everyone will think is deserving of running the country. Too many underworld families behind the scenes living large. Find the families that were spared going to the front line with cushy jobs,,, you'll scrape up the blood line of the "elite" family's. Most of them are living in western countries lying low,,, probably in low level security govt jobs. Getting free education.
Seriously. I think the American system is probably slightly better than Russia - but I couldn’t see someone in a high security prison seeing their lawyer very often or even write if the guards don’t want them to.
What do you mean? They didn't try it again? They don't need to try because they know they can do it whenever they want. There's no rush. And they can move him into solitary and cut off total contact to his lawyer whenever they want. Because of course there is no rule of law there.
