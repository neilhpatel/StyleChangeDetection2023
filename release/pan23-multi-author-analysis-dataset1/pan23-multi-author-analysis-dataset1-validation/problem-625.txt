>“We have so very few of these taonga and treasures left in our possession,” he said. “When something like this comes up where we’re both excited, but also that sorrowful that we lost so much.”.
Intergenerational takeback-sies probably isn't going to happen. Not the best example to focus on if they want people to support their case.
That's actually totally wrong. A stolen item will generally need to be returned as the purchaser purchased from a party that didn't have title. I've seen it in the automotive world and the art world primarily.
Try also to keep in mind that practices around the connection to buried objects / cemeteries in Polynesian cultures are so strong and so well known that the first European to land in New Zealand (Captain Cook) was killed in Hawaii in 1779 after an escalating situation that initiated when he ordered his crew to steal wood surrounding the indigenous cemetary where cheiftains were buried (Morai).
A verbal condition that may not have in fact existed. Let's be honest. If there isn't any contemporaneous documentation supporting that condition, it didn't happen for all practical purposes.
Lol no, what planet are you writing from. What you've written is the exact opposite of any legal system I can find, either generally (eg 'possession of stolen goods' on wikipedia) or specifically regarding stolen goods in the UK. I have not been able to find any examples of purported 'new' owners retaining stolen goods without consent/agreement by original owner, especially as regards non-commodities / non-fungible items espec of sentimental value, which clearly applies to Taonga.
