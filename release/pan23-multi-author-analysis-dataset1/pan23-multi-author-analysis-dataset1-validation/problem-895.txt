Although the principle aim of the order, as detailed in the other clauses, was to place pressure on officers and commanders to hold the line, the policy of never surrender nevertheless came to be applied to the personnel of all ranks. Later decrees simply solidified this position further mandating penal servitude and even public hanging for “traitors and betrayers”.
Thanks. I guess that's all I needed to hear, that you consider it more or less synonymous with real convictions. I do not ask about other categories because I realize how fluid the situation could be for people who already got any kind of отчуждение прав. Though as I understand mostly they were just shoved away to the outskirts to work menial jobs (a fate much preferable to that of the German POWs on permanent work details, isn't it?).
Although Soviet soldiers did, at times, defect, the numbers were far smaller than the numbers treated as such, but even into the 1990s Russo/Soviet historical memory which considered defection and captivity to be near synonyms only really began to crack in the Perestroika era, and it wouldn’t be until 1995 that former POWs were allowed to be considered actual ‘war participants’. It is interesting that more recent Russian historical works have gone in the other direction now, downplaying defection and collaboration as much as possible and instead highlighting the forms of resistance and defiance that Soviet POWs evidenced during their ordeal.
Thank you for the write-up! Can I possibly ask you to give some approximate proportions of cleared vs. forced restoration labor vs. convicted, if you have it on hand (you probably do)?
Then, regarding that third group, are these all presumed to be convicted to serve time (or the "ultimate measure")? Is it just standard "you get a ten, and you get a ten, oh you actually did something shady, get a fifteen"? Or is there exists maybe yet another breakdown that reflects further processing?
