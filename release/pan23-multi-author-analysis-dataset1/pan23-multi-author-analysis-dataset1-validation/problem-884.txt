EU blocked RT as well. Entire civilized world should also block RT channels, in one of their tv shows they called for drowning of ukrainian children ..
Unfortunately yes. Russian propaganda operates differently in Ukraine. It used to be typical to blame the Ukrainian army of being corrupt and unprepared for the attack. A common one was that the forces were relocated away from Kherson and told not to engage the Russian advances. That certain roads were de-mined. Another one is that Ukrainians are under equiped and that supplies are being sold by military leadership (this one is also common in the West). The most recent one is a conspiracy theory that Ukraine is actually selling energy and that's the reason for the blackouts. Some of the wildest one's are that air defense is deliberately not shooting down some missiles to have an excuse for why there's no power when it's being exported. So yeah Ukrainians won't believe the obviously pro Russian crap, but will fall for these dumb conspiracies.
