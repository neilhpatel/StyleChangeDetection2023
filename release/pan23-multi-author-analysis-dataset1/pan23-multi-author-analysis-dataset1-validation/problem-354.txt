He was originally tutored in military matters by Carl Magnus Stuart, who had briefly served in England, worked extensively on fortification design and observed the Austrian army in its war against the Ottomans 1685. He also toured Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands to study the lastest military developments. Later the young Prince and then King would also be tutored by Carl Gustaf Rehnskiöld, one of the most brilliant Swedish generals and perhaps one of the best of his time.
Rehnskiöld and Stuart, together with King Karl XI would be the fathers of the Swedish "gå på" tactical school that they developed, based on earlier Swedish tactics and the offensive French tactics as experienced by Rehnskiöld. The young prince often accompanied his father, Stuart and Rehnskiöld as they tried out various tactical solutions, using the Life Guards regiment in Stockholm in mock battles using blank ammunition, building various fortifications and terrain features at the royal grazing meadow Ladugårdsgärdet (today a public park in Stockholm). He also accompanied his father on several inspection trips, where they would travel simply and at very high paces with very few followers to catch officials and officers off guard and reveal corruption and neglection of duty. He also partook in generalmönstring, a system in which the indelta (alotted) Swedish semi-professional army held larger musters - entering new soldiers into the lists, retiring older ones, inspecting equipment, supplying new or replacement equipment but also held larger exercises - both in drill and mock battles including several regiments.
He inherited a tactical system developed by his father and the same generals that tutored him, from a combination of French and Swedish experience and only modified it slightly, updating the infantry's tactical manuals of 1696 and 1701 in 1708, changing the distance of salvos fired from 70 and 30 paces to 20 and 10.
Changed it from 20 and 10 paces? That's extremely close? I can't imagine you would even have time to reload and fire again in ten paces. And it seems like even if the fire isn't as effective at range, getting more salvos in from a longer range, before they get close, would be more effective.
