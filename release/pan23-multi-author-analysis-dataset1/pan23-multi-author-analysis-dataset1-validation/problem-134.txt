Honestly your first course of action should have been to politely talk to the neighbor. Usually the fastest route to solving these types of problems. Explain nicely and without attitude that the smell bothers you and ask if they can open a window, and put a fan in it to exhaust the smoke. Once you start reporting them it turns into a whole other battle where they view you as the asshole neighbor who's trying to keep them from relaxing at the end of a long day instead of a friendly neighbor just asking a favor. It's similar to dealing with noise complaints. Usually if you approach a neighbor and ask them to keep it down a little bit and explain why, usually they'll at least try to bring the noise down(obviously some people are just assholes), but if you jump right to calling the cops you now become the bad guy and they could give a fuck less about keeping the noise down. As far as legal options, you can go after the landlord for it, but not the tennant, and if keeping the apartment is high on your priority list, going after the landlord probably isn't a good idea. It's definitely a situation that would be easier to resolve between you and the neighbor directly but if you've already burned that bridge or are uncomfortable doing it, consistently reporting the issue is really your only option.
Right. A cease and desist is just a letter. Exhaust all normal methods first. Run out of all other options with management. Just sending a letter doesn't mean you have to sue.
