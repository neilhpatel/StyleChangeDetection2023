In addition to your signs you can post your property with a purple paint on trees trees near the perimeter. Inform the grandparents in writing (registered mail) that their family has been trespassed as you have asked them multiple times to stay off your property. In Iowa folks must be notified to leave before it’s considered trespassing. Let them know you have both signs and painted trees and the boundaries of your property should be very clear. Maybe the kids can’t read or something but purple paint is a well known way of posting your property.
Contact your insurance company. Their lawyers can also send a letter and advise you on what else you can/should do. Your local Extension Agent may be able to give you some more information on liability for woodlands or contact to who may help.
Hahahahahaha! Was my first response. Second response was that's the consequences of trespassing and may have done more than you asking them to stop. Not illegal to have a natural space unless there are local ordinances against it.
