CDU/CSU, Ã–VP, basically ANY European conservative party. I am sorry, but the Democrats are merely right, in parts center right from a European perspective.
No education. No sense of community. Over reliance on religion and a religious basis of "obey the authority/leader".

State-enforced religious taxes are so fundamentally unAmerican its literally in our Constitution that they can't happen. The fact that you think its normal because its "above board" shows how far off the map Europe and America are. I'm sure the far, far right wing of the country would love it if they could do it, but even they know its a bad idea to even pretend to talk about it. And yeah, Republicans love wearing their religion on their sleeves. But they don't literally put their religion into the name of their party, cause they'd run into some major problems really fast, unlike say Germany with is Christian Democrats.
