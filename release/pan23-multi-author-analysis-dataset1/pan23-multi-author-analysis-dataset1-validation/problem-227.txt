People don't like to see their precious luxury goods taken away. They better get used to it, because the only solution to the environmental catastrophe unleashed by the industrial revolution is less consumption.
Hmm kind of hard to say. The Italians can grow hazelnuts all by themselves obviously. But even though Nutella is marketed as 'chocolate and hazelnut' spread, apparently it's mostly sugar and palm oil. Which has it's own problems. There's a lot more awareness about deforestation as a result palm oil in the mainstream, especially in the last 10 years.
Malaysia and Indonesia also have deforestation issues as well, specially surrounding palm oil. So look out for reduces in those types of products.
As a South American I'm not even sure what the right way to solve the Amazon thing would be, I often hear people going on about how the problem is specifically meat or what have you, but knowing the people doing all the exploiting I can't help but think they'll just turn to another grift and then another just to keep burning the land to make a profit. Especially because the region is in some places very rich for mining and that just poisons the environment way too much.
