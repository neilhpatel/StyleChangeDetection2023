I went on a cruise ship for the first time a couple months ago. I had originally booked for May 2020, but that was obviously postponed. The cruise was a transatlantic crossing, and the reason I booked was because I wanted to be completely detached from the world (and work). My original desire for isolation however changed after 2 years of Covid isolation. I also caught Covid for the first time after taking that cruise!
While unlucky, I also realized catching Covid was a big risk of taking a cruise. I mitigated that risk by getting a booster shot a couple weeks prior, which may have helped lessen the severity. I had an intense fever, but I was completely free of symptoms after only 36hrs.
It’s an interesting theory but I actually think humanity would be extremely difficult to completely eradicate. A pandemic would have to have some very very specific and unusual traits to even come close, and even then, people in isolated areas would probably survive just by chance. Climate change, nuclear war, same problems it’s hard to imagine there wouldn’t be at least a few refuges that shelter enough people to start again.
