Strictly speaking the manner in which most scriptures define caste, the caste system or its development and evolution, has little to do with how castes and caste hierarchies actually developed in the real world. For example, texts such as the Purusha Shukta may describe how the "cosmic being was divided into 4 parts and out of each part namely the head, the arms, the torso and the legs, each of the varnas were formed namely the Brahmins, the Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas and the Shudras respectively". However this implies two things, 1) That the caste an individual was born into dictated the occupations he was allowed to choose in life and that throughout history these were the only occupations said individuals chose.
can you link the verse in rig veda. also it must be noted that in purushas creation he was lying down. Furthermore, the caste system as we see it today was first expanded upon in the manu smriti which is a political and not a religious text, Krishna in the bhagavad gita said all people regardless of varna or gender could attain moksha.
No. The caste system was merely the name that the British assigned to the system of social organisation that they observed in India. To say that it was somehow shaped or manufactured by the British would be to ignore the previous 3000 years of history which shaped the caste system which the British came into contact with in the 17th and 18th centuries.
Yeah . the 40% number was still confusing but the post you linked explains it perfectly. Thanks. I thought peshwas were a special case of brahmin warriors in modern era.
Btw, I asked a tangentially related question few days ago, regarding how normal it was for a brahmin to be warrior.
