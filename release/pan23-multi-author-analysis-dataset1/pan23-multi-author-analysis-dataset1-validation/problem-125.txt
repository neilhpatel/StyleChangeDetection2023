Well I'm not sure you can say "the groups actually did what they were accused of doing" at all â€” though it is the case that people, of course, have all sorts of senses of self-identity that come through mutual experiences, education, ethnicity, etc., and the Soviets were essentially dedicated to trying to make sure all of that was secondary to a sense of "Sovietness.".
I know some groups were targeted particularly by the Soviet state, but how accurate was it that those groups were ideologically pro-capitalist as opposed to being Anti-Soviet (or just unlucky)? Would people at a dinner party say something like "There goes Georgy espousing the powers of the free market - that's what happens when you hang around with too many engineers.".
There were certainly other professions that were targeted, and certainly classes of people (like the Kulaks in Ukraine), as harboring anti-Soviet sympathies as a group, or being particularly ideologically suspicious (e.g., scientists whose theories were too influenced by ideas developed in Western nations, unless very careful, could fall under ideological scrutiny, and entire areas of study, like economics, history, and sociology, needed to be entirely conformed with Soviet ideology, or risk great peril).
