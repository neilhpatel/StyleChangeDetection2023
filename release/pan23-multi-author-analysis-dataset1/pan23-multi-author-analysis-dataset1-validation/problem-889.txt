The map lists states with laws protecting reproductive healthcare. There are additional states where state supreme courts have recognized an implied state constitutional right to reproductive healthcare (i.e., a "state-level" Roe v. Wade decision).
The states that have passed laws protecting reproductive healthcare are probably "safer bets" than those that only have state-level Roe protections, because some of the (which includes Florida, Kansas, Montana and South Carolina) have legislatures and/or governors that are very anti-choice. For example, the Iowa Supreme Court - which previously held that the Iowa Constitution protects choice - (just before SCOTUS reversed Roe) after the state's Republican governors successfully politicized the court.
I saw it in my hometown I grew up in. Lots of local leaders, very vocal that covid was just a cold.
The Democratic (DFL)-controlled Minnesota legislature will be considering additional legislation to further bolster access to reproductive healthcare in the state next month.
Of course not. Problem is we’re divided on what means ‘healthcare’. Those morally opposed to abortion truly believe they are fighting for a righteous cause. What we lack is a common foundation for understanding because some of us use science and the rest use nonsense.
