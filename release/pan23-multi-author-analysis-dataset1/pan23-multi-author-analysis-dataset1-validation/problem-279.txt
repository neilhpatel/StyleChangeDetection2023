Sadly, daily life is one of the most difficult aspects of history to trace. Think about it: if you are writing a diary about your life, are you going to talk about how you ate your meal or did your job? No, because it's a given!
The most important thing I find is to read on a variety of topics, a variety of aspects of a topic, and different authors with somewhat varied opinions and use a little bit of your judgement in taking an approach. Particularly for creative historical work; since we can never really say for sure what was true and some details are undocumented or unexplored, there is a lot of room for creative liberty, even including the possibility that some credible seeming sources or good theories are wrong, since you don't have to proof it for fiction as long as it's possible.
Hope that works as a start. If you have any more specific questions about how things worked, please let me know! I can steer you in the right direction.
“From Civilitas to Civility: Codes of Manners in Medieval and Early Modern England” by John Gillingham (2002) and “Tudor Humanism and the Roman Past: A Background to Shakespeare” by Paul Dean (1988) might be relevant for the higher class characters:
There's also “Literacy and the Social Order: Reading and Writing in Tudor and Stuart England” by David Cressy (1980):
You could also try “Libels, Popular Literacy and Public Opinion in Early Modern England” by Pauline Croft (1995).
Another book overview, although slightly earlier focus, is “The Elizabethan World” by Susan Doran and Norman Jones (2011):
“How to be a Tudor: A Dawn-to-Dusk Guide to Everyday Life” by Ruth Goodman (2015) is a good look at focused though varied domestic aspects although also slightly earlier focus than your reference point;.
“If Walls Could Talk-The History of the Home” by Lucy Worsley covers domestic details which is relevant, although her account of Tudor/Stuart hygiene is in my opinion slightly over-critical. (for some reason someone put vines at the end of this playlist, you can definitely ignore those).
