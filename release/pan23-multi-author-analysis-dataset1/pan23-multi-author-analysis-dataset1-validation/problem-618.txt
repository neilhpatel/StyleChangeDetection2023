Firstly, there is important distinction to be made between roughly two broad categories of cities, (1) those with relatively stable ( Roman ) continuity and others communal cities, to those from (2) high to late Middle Ages, usually established as imperial cities or by other territorial lords, although this differentiation can be somewhat problematic if generalized too much.
But the tradition of other communal cities, which would by the roughly 13th century come either under other City republics, like Venice, or others, like Trieste under Habsburgs, would go through slight modifications, namely, there was usually an apointee, the Venetians called them Potestas et Capetaneus, Habsburgs Hauptmann, but their role was largely limited to millitary function, and civil matters were left to the cities themselves, although between them, Venetain were definitely more intrusive due to the the geographical positions.
Others were less lucky, e.g. when Quedlinburg tried to evict their abbess forcefully her noble family came to her rescue, conquered the town and ended all ambition - Quedlinburg had to leave the Hanse and end all similar alliances.
