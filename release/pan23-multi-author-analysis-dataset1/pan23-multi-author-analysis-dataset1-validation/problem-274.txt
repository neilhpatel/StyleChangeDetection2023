I would argue that the modern theories are much more nuanced and united, and that there is not much controversy left in the question of what caused World War 1: a little bit of everything. You'll find imperialism, nationalism, cultural and diplomatic militarism, the naval race, the alliance systems and the crises in Morocco and the Balkans in most books that pertain to these topics, and you'll find few mainstream voices that dispute the overall importance of either of these.
Thank you for the awesome answer. When you mentioned writing on the historiography of German WWI & WWII, was that on askhistorians? I couldn't find it when I searched and would love to read it.
You ask almost on the side whether or not there is a document that proves that Germany wanted the war or not - and in fact, there are a few juicy snippets in Fischer's book that might be of interest that lay blame at the feet of specifically the German Kaiser Wilhelm II, who, according to Fischer, did not in fact want to prevent a war, but wanted to start a regional war between Austria and Serbia and then stop it from spreading out of the regional frame through other powers' involvement.
