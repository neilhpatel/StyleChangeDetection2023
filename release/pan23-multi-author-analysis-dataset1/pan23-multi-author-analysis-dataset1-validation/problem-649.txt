Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you're asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don't know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in-depth or highly plot-reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.
A million eons ago (translation: about 20 years ago) I did a lot of research into how compulsory sterilization worked in California, the most-sterilizing of the states, and what I found was that because of the way the California sterilization law was constructed, and because of the way in which the California mental health system was set up prior to the 1950s, the medical superintendents at the various California institutions that could order sterilizations had almost total autonomy in the decision of whether to sterilize and why to sterilize. As a result, when you look closely at the institutions that either did a lot of sterilization or no sterilization, you find that there were people there who ran the institutions for a long time and had strong opinions on the matter. Interestingly even the ones who sterilized did not necessarily embrace eugenics as their main motivation â€” in one hospital, for example, the medical superintendent subscribed to a crackpot theory about how sterilization would provide therapeutic value to patients. But in the sterilization-permissive atmosphere of the system, that was regarded as just fine. In one hospital there was a superintendent who did not believe mental illness had a surgical or hereditary component, and instead only subscribed to somatic therapies (like psychoanalysis or hydrotherapy). And at some places they had such institutional turnover in terms of medical superintendents that no straightforward policy ever was set.
