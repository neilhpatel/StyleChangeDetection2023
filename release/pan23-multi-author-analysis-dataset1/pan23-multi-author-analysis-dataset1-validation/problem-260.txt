As an American the anti-world cup sentiment has been pretty prevalent amongst my various social circles. Granted the talking points and reasoning aren't consistent across everyone, but in general the people I've spoken to about it want nothing to do with this event and will not be supporting it. Part of it may just be that culturally soccer isn't that important here, and I'd expect in countries where it's the predominant sport that viewership will still well exceed 10% despite the deplorable actions of the Qatari government.
