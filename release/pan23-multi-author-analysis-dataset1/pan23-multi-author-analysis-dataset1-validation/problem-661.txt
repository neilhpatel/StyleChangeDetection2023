Do you know what was presented as reasoning at Hearing? Have there been previous Incidents? Bites, roaming, menacing, etc. Has he ,nipped' anyone in the past? Yourself included?
2. I was asked by the investigator to make a statement by using my own means of recording and submit to her email address. It was never taken officially by her asking questions and officially recording my statement. She said to record myself on a phone app and email it to her.. It was at formality at best because she never gave me the opportunity to defend myself against my neighbors accusations in real time. Only a self prepared self recorded statement that was sent to her email. I also submitted timestamped photos of the pattern left by the riding mower all the way to the middle of my yard with a clearly cut path entering and exiting my property from his. Also included in the picture was the lead the dog was attached to anchored to a 5 pound corkscrew into the ground. About 2 months later I was at ACS and ran into the Asst. Director and I brought it to his attention what I just stated along with photos which I had stored on my phone and he responded with a reaction of disbelief and said that he never was made aware of these facts even though the investigator, who had no where near the training of an officer of the law who is taught to conduct a fair and impartial investigation to reach a determination that will prove beyond a reasonable doubt if the accusation has merit and if so who bears the burden of liability and was it justifiable by any current law. In summary I can logically express my right of opportunity to defend myself against an official accusation that would be addressed in a court of law was not provided to me causing my right to due process, which is guaranteed to me by the 14th amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, to be withheld causing me a huge disadvantage in my quest for vindication.
Much of this sounds unbelievable. I appreciate you answering some of my questions although there is lot of rambling stuff and it's tough with no paragraph breaks to parse.(BTW you gotta double carriage return/enter to make line breaks, I know it's especially aggravating formatting on Reddit on Mobile though it better than it used to be!).
Two days later my wife and I woke up to pounding on my front door to a dog catcher telling me to go get my dog he taking him in for a 10 day observation and I said no he tried to intimidate me with consequences but I wasn't having it as being a 53 year old man I knew my rights and told him to get off my porch my dog had his shots and tags so I could observe him myself with a series of video clips as data. He said he'll be back and left. Next day he's back yelling my name like an idiot so I go outside and tell him to leave as I had already verified my rights to observe by our veterinarian. He said he wasn't leaving without the dog and I told him to get a warrant. He says I don't need one I'll just call a cop to assist and when the cop got there I told him my position and he turned to the dog catcher and said "You got about as much right to take this man's dog as the mailman which means you don't get the dog so you need to settle down and leave the property".
The fact is drugs alter Perception and Memory. Whether it's pain control for cancer or illegal meth. There's a lot of hard to believe in you scenario, but even in what you have shared there's still a lot making this dog appear dangerous. Creditability of statements and who is giving the statements can matter a lot in hearings. That may not be the purest ideal of justice but it is taken into account.
