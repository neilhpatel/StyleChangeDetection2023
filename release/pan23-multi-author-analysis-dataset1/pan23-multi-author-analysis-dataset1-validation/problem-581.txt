First of all, you should see if you can her a lawyer, perhaps through a domestic violence assistance agency. Or call one in the area you came from. You don’t have to be in the area to use a lawyer there.
Protective orders in family/domestic violence are usually quasi-criminal, meaning it’s a civil order relating to a criminal offense.
Thank you. I will get assistance with a lawyer if and only it reaches the point of writing a brief. Prior to this process I’m on my own.
On the domestic violence, unless there is a conviction related to domestic violence, the military generally won’t do anything. The threat to military career would be from violating the protective order. They would also make sure that the spouse and child are receiving required support payments, either as required by military regulation or a written court order that supersedes the regulation.
The OP would be best served by hiring an attorney and hammering out an agreement that protects her and her children and ends any further legal obligations she retains through marriage. Divorce attorneys are usually pretty good at letting both sides know what a court will likely decide and work unemotionally to hammer out an agreement. That would include an honest examination of domestic violence issues and how the unique circumstances of the OPs case are likely to be handled in the process.
