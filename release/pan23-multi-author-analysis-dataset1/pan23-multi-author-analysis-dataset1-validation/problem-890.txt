Standard language in real estate transactions holds that you keep the property in the home. The only time issues really arise is when there is something that was clearly lost/hidden and the seller didn't know it (think an estate sells a home without knowledge that the eccentric dead person put paint cans of cash in the walls - they may successfully sue for a return of the money in certain instances).
Thank you. This was my line of thought as well, I was just worried about the furniture left behind not being specifically stated in the contract (have to check) but I don’t think it should make a difference either way.
Yeah and that makes so much sense, I just get nervous because I can’t remember if it says in our contract that we got the house and specifically the stuff in it as well. But idk if that really matters. The person who sold us the house wants to take us to court over this. I can’t explain much more without giving away too many details, but if they go through with it I feel like there’s no way we could lose?
