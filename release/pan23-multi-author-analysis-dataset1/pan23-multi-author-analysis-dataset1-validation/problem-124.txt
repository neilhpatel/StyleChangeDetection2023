If this is indeed true why can't these candidates be named, and perhaps questioned? They ran for office for god sakes so it's not private. Or are these just random allegations thrown at people hoping they stick?
the Canada US trade relationship has been the world's biggest for decades especially since the first Free Trade Act 1988, then NAFTA, then USMCA, Canada has lost a lot of auto factories that used to enjoy their own special trade laws under the Auto Pact, all the US trade unions had big membership in Canada at US owned factories; although those days are gone the trade value is still biggest between Can-US, for e.g. something we have today we didn't have then are oil pipelines sending crude directly to US refineries and the oil co's have shut down and torn down almost every refinery in Canada so we rely on US refineries for our supply which is nuts when Canada could have energy independence but we don't own or control our own oil in the ground because that would be contrary to the global oil corp's plans.
But it is not easy. Both North American countries have realized as they took stock of matters that they were heavily intertwined with China - I suspect in fact this threesome was the world's largest trading block. And Canada has a couple of additional considerations that are not factors in America: a prior federal govt under Stephen Harper signed an incredibly lopsided foreign investment agreement with China in its favor that penalizes Canada for almost any negative action it takes in respect of Chinese companies investing in Canada.
I did once. That damn wizard had no sense of right nor wrong. Shanked me and took off with my dignity. Literally my dignity. Fucking God damned wizards!
Given how its hands are tied legally by the investment trade agreement as well as legal and domestic politics the CAD govt has embarked on a rather clever strategy: on certain matters they block the transaction using "security reviews" and then park the issue there as who can say how long such security reviews take to decide? And on security matters Canada traditionally has actually been quite tight lipped. From this govt rarely a peep.
also treat Canada as the source for raw materials rather than finished goods or parts, hasn't historically encouraged skilled jobs except in the east which had the infrastructure (energy, transportation, etc.) and ready access to cross border markets, and which had already attracted major US industry to set up 'branch plants' in Canada, like steel and autos since late 19th c., and which today has become rust belt.
