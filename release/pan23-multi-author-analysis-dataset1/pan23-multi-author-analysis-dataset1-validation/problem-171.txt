Sanchez revealed that the arrival of Leopard tanks in Ukraine would correspond with the return of trained soldiers.
"As Ukraine's forces prepare for major deliveries of armored combat vehicles, troops are training on Leopard tanks in Spain.
According to Ukrinform, Spain is training troops to use Leopard 2 A4 tanks while it readies six tanks to Ukraine by late March or early April, according to Defense Minister Margarita Robles, as reported by Reuters.
"We are aiming to synchronize the delivery of the Leopards with the finalization of the training of Ukrainian soldiers," Sanchez said, adding that Spain could send more Leopard tanks later if needed.
