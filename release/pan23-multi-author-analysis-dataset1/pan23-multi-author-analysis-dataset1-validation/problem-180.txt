Also, if we do assume that nations are old, then what happened in XIX century? Because I still see different groups of people going from "We are both Italian, but we're going to kill each other because you're from Venice and I'm from Piedmont and our shared culture doesn't matter"(massively simplifying here, obviously) to "We are all Italians no matter which region of Italy we represent", all in a rather short timespan.
The first is the rise of universal suffrage. As people increasingly believed that common people deserved a voice in politics, nationalism emerged as a force that could unite the interests of common people and elites. I would argue that it is not a coincidence that many early nationalist movements were also strongly pro-democracy. The liberal ideal of the mid-19th century was often to advocate for democratic nation-states, most clearly shown in the revolutions of 1848. It is only with the emergence of fascism, an political philosophy that it is extremely nationalistic and anti-democratic that the link begins to sever (which was reinforced by the backlash against fascism, producing a brand of European liberalism that was pro-democratic and anti-nationalistic).
Is there any further reading on this debate among historians? It would be interesting to see what different points of view exist.
