I'm quite critical of the media in my country but it's nothing compared to theirs. We have alternatives (even within the mainstream), independent agencies and individuals, plus our internet isn't locked down. I can read news from Africa, the middle East (Al Jazeera for e.g.), South America, India, even China if I wanted to I reckon (and could read Chinese!).
I’m the biggest Putin opponent you can find having left Russia right after the war broke out, but it’s pretty obvious, if you follow his logic - it doesn’t matter how flawed it is, he still thinks this way - then nuclear strike in Ukraine would also do the same thing (i.e. end war and thus prevent loss of lives from both sides). Now the difference is that US would have won the war anyways with additional casualties, while Russia is on path to lose the war, so this is not the same situation.
Hold the phone. Did Turkey actually change its name to Turkiye solely because they were offended that their name was synonymous with a bird in a foreign language? That’s hilarious, and reeks of low self-esteem.
