Yes. You don't get to count willy nilly. There are laws behind it. We have Biden literally saying he put together the largest voter fraud organization in history. When we gonna do something about that?

Trump is now a Poison pill for any campaign but Desantis remains popular among republicans and is one of the few republican candidates that won handedly not only despite of a blue wave, but also because of high popularity among latinos. Thats a big deal for republican strategists. So while it pains me to say it, agree with you on the Trump but Desantis has a real shot if he runs in 2024.
