“I hope I am wrong,” Minihan, who heads the Air Force’s Air Mobility Command, wrote in a memo, which circulated on social media, to the leadership of its 110,000 members. Chinese President Xi Jinping, he explains, “secured his third term and set his war council in October 2022. Taiwan’s presidential elections are in 2024 and will offer Xi a reason. United States’ presidential elections are in 2024 and will offer Xi a distracted America. Xi’s team, reason, and opportunity are all aligned for 2025.”.
Extra bonus points if the majority of the American public supports the war and then 20 years later claim that it was unpopular and that it was only supported because the government lied to them and that they couldn't have known better while ignoring the fact that plenty of people protested but those voices were ignored as those protestors were vilified and called un-American for doing so (see any US war).
Nope. I said that the logic applied to that statement is mirroring the one used in case of a very similar dictatorship and proved to be completely false.
Could be US+Europe+UK+India+South Korea+Japan+Israel versus China+Russia+North Korea+Pakistan+Turkey.
Right. And what exactly was it that everyone was saying about the possibility of Russia invading? Even right up to when they were massing troops on the border? And when the US intelligence agencies were openly warning there was going to be an invasion?
