Thank you for doing this AMA! I'm sure you'll have enough questions about berserkers so I'll leave that for someone else.
Christians continued to tell these stories for centuries after they stopped being "sacred" in any meaningful way Snorri is writing in the 1220s, and the oldest manuscript of the Poetic Edda dates to the 1270s or 1280s The stories were clearly resonant in some way even when the audience didn't straightforwardly believe in them, and it's possible, especially with the prose myths, they morph over time to better reflect Christian values, and therefore retain relevance and meaning in a Christian cultural space.
It’s Ubisoft. And I’m not talking about woolen tunics, I’m talking about badass armour like gambesons, chainmail shirts, hauberks, spectacle helmets and nasal helmets with aventails, all of those things are something eivor would use since he’s a rich clan leader. But thanks for your reply.
The use of Scandinavian folkloric themes allowed this developing scene to engage in what Trafford and Plukowski call "the broad semiotic system favored by many black and death metal bands, not least of all the exultation of violence and hyper-masculinity expressed through weapons and battlefields" while also embracing the uniqueness of their own perceived heritage and idiomatic folk music traditions while avoiding the Judeo-Christian themed Satanism which defined contemporary American and European black metal. As Bathory's Quorthon wrote:
I'm interested how Christianity and Norse paganism intersected. In a lot of popular media, Norse pagans treat the Christian God as just another deity/member of the pantheon - do we know how Norse pagans actually viewed the concept of God?
The Bj. 581 burial is still very complicated and far from being well understood. But the short version of that 2017 article and 2019 followup is: since the burial was first excavated in the 1800s, it has always been interpreted as a high-status warrior burial. The grave goods and position in the graveyard fit essentially every criteria earlier archaeologist used to decide what was a warrior burial. Then, in 2015, while doing a broad osteological study of Birka's bone samples, the researchers noticed that Bj. 581 came back as a female skeleton. That was weird, so they did more detailed testing and confirmed it - the skeleton that used to inhabit that grave is genetically and osteologically female. There is no room in the grave for a second inhabitant, the bones were not mislabelled, none of that - Bj. 581 was Assigned Female at Birth. Those are the parts that are known with certainty.
Æthelflæd of Mercia, Procuratrix Merciorum and daughter of Alfred of Wessex rules Mercia independently and leads military expeditions against the Welsh and Danes, but there's no record of her actually engaging directly in the fighting as there are with her father or nephews.
I agree. The farthest we have literally any evidence of Norse travel to or from is Central Asia, and reaching even that far requires taking Yngvars saga víðförla, a saga in which the heroes meet a giant, a dragon named Jakulus (a name borrowed from Isidore of Seville's Etymologies) and actual Satan, as being more fact than fiction.
Mercia was a very different kettle of fish. Ceolwulf's son might have been important, but he wasn't an ætheling. This is because Mercia was a tribal hegemony that functioned as, essentially, a tribal federation. In essence, this meant a small number of noble clans rotating power between them, so while most Mercian rulers were in some way related to at least some of their predecessors, they were unlikely to have passed the throne father to son. Indeed, only Offa passed the throne via direct succession and that ended badly, his son being deposed after just a few months.
