IANAL, but I am a hospital administrator (I know, boo, hiss). Thereâ€™s a lot of confusion in the comments about using PAPRs and CAPRs- my hospital exclusively used CAPRs in our COVID units for most of the pandemic. They are appropriate and preferred. The hospital is likely refusing the request because their clinical engineering and infection prevention teams would not be able to verify the quality and efficacy of equipment you brought from home. These machines need fairly regular servicing from a qualified professional.
NAL. I remember early in the Pandemic some Sikh doctors very publicly shaved their beards to fit PPE. But that was March 2020 and as you rightly point out OP we have more knowledge and availability of alternatives.
yes, absolutely. That was my first thought as well when I was mulling over the suggestion. But I came to the conclusion that, from a legal perspective (which is the primary concern on this sub), freedom of religion would likely trump such concerns. The defense would likely have to prove the harm, quantify it, prove that it can't be ameliorated, quantify that, and successfully argue that it is sufficient to warrant infringing on freedom of religion. While not impossible (and with some potential handicapping based on the particular judge or court), that would be a very high bar to clear.
