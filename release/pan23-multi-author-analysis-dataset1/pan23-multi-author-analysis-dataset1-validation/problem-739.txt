No one ever said "kill Palestinians" outright, but I've heard everything from "lower than street dogs" to "They're just animals & bring their demise upon themselves- they are worthless & even other Arab countries don't want them as refugees." You're telling me you've never heard variations of that? I don't lie, never, gave it up about 8-10 yrs ago. I won't even lie & say a baby is beautiful if it's not!
>Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, another settler and ultranationalist politician who has previously been convicted of racism and supporting a terrorist organisation, will be national security minister, responsible for the police.
What are you even talking about? If by "US Israelites", you mean American Jews, then no lol, American Jews cannot cast votes in Israeli elections based on our ethnicity. We're American citizens, we vote in American elections.
Are they now American citizens? If so, then yes, they vote in American elections, just like every other immigrant who has ever come to the US and achieved citizenship. If they are not American citizens, then no, they do not vote in American elections. I have worked as a poll worker before, non-citizens are not able to cast votes; if they try for whatever reason, their votes are discarded. Happy to elaborate on how the vote verification process works, if you want.
