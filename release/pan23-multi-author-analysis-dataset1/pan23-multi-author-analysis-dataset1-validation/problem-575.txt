The mounted archer “samurai” was most predominant in the Heian period, (790-1190, give or take 5 years.) During this time, samurai were indeed mostly archers who rode into battle on horseback in flashy armor, though the horses and armor were mostly there to flaunt wealth. Samurai occupied a role one step below that of the Daimyo, or local liege lord. (Daimyo were in turn one step below the Emperor, then later the Shogun, though especially during this time period their agency within their lands was far greater.) Thus, samurai were mostly either court bodyguards or mid-low level nobles (or both), who only occasionally had to march out and disperse peasant revolts or small invasions. During these revolts, they were for the most part greatly outnumbered and up against men with spears and little training or morale. The Katana just isn’t useful during these engagement, so setting up 100 men on a hill and pelting the crowd with arrows (all while looking impressive and rich) usually did the trick. When it came to disputes over territory or what have you between local lords, usually champion samurai were sent out to fight it out, one on one.
Wonderful answer! Since you seem knowledgeable I’ll ask, was seppuku as big a part of Japanese culture as we think?
Much appreciated! Benesch definitely sounds like something I need to track down. I deal with honor culture in a European context and expanding that to understand some of the cross-cultural comparisons is on my one day checklist. Sounds like it would be quite useful for that.
1910s: nationalist party dominates. They co-opt some of the traditionalist rhetoric to hijack momentum from the left, using the very appeal of their past enemies, and boom, Japanese empire born.
