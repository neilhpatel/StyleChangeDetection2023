Why does it have to be attributed to malice? Using the United States as my point of reference, I wouldn't expect people to be all that familiar with the details of our rather checkered history. Most people probably don't know much about what we've done in Iraq and Afghanistan let alone the specifics of older conflicts. Older folks would remember the Gulf War but Millenials/GenZ probably know next to nothing about it; I'd expect our young people to vaguely know that Vietnam was "bad" because it was a deeply unpopular major war, but I wouldn't expect them to know much in the way of specifics. Asking random people on the street why Latin America has deep-seated resentment towards the United States is probably going to get most people either making up and saying nonsense or asking "Latin America doesn't like us?".
I don't know if the "both sides" thing applies here when Japan literally committed genocide at a larger scale than the Nazis and still continue to remove mention of it from history books and try to retract apologies or visit shrines to war criminals?
Good. Like, I totally get it. The atrocities of WW2 and a standoffish attitude about them aren't things you just kind of "get over." But there are worse things than that in the area right now.
