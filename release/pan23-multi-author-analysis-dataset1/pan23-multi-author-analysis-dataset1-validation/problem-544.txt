In a perverse and twisted way it kind of is though. There will be ultra nationalistic Russians who believe the propaganda and/or want Putin to restore the Soviet Union to make their lives better who sadly agree with this action.
How? With what leader? What weapons? Would the coup be internationally recognized? It's bit as simple as throwing up your hands and walking out in the street.
It's extremely difficult to escape a violent relationship, I'd imagine the whole country would go through a physical emotional collapse if when they realise the violent oppressive relationship between them, Putin and leadership is finally confronted.
Why? Liberal Democrats kick conservatives off social media, get them fired from their jobs, attack absolutely anyone who disagrees with them. There's no difference.
Those people could potentially cause Putin a headache should they gain enough numbers and a loud enough voice as they brand anyone who so much as hints at withdrawing from the war without total victory as a coward, a weak and unpatriotic person in league with Nazis and the West.
