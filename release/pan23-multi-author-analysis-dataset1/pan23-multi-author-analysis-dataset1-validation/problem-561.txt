They want you to know it was them, and the bodies are probably tortured/broken before being tossed out the window. They want everyone to know what will happen when they get on Putin's bad side. But the defenestration and false autopsy gives them just enough wiggle room to deny it while laughing in everyone's face, while we all know it wasn't an accident and Putin knows everyone knows too.
People watch too much tv. It's very easy to cover your tracks in real life. A murder from my grandmother's block in Philly went unsolved for 15 years because the guy wore a bald cap. He was on recording breaking in, touching everything, and leaving with blood on him. Only reason he was caught was he pawned a piece of jewelry years later that was a limited run tiffany that was in the report. Cops even arrested this guy in connection to it a few days after it happenedbut let him go in under 30 minutes without printing him because he wasn't bald.
