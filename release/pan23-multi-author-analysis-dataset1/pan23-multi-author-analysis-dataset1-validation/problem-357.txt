It is a common trope on popular TV shows that mighty lords have to deal with endless strings of people coming to them to ask for justice. Those scenes often display a very young lord who's quite unaware on how to proceed. A faithful or treacherous advisers reaches his ear and whispers something. The young lord, as a character, is being tested. What will he do? How will he solve the problem? How will he deal with the emotions thrown at him? As far as character development goes, this is an interesting scene. As far as history goes, this is rather clich√©.
In John Falstaff (I know he is a fictional character) has a very friendly relationship with Henry V before he becomes king (He takes him to a tavern where they dance and get drunk etc) but after Henry becomes king, everything is very formal and he has to cut his relationship with him and when they eventually reunite, John treats him as a younger brother rather than his king. Is there any truth to this?
When he recovered the duchy of Burgundy and snatched it from the Hapsburg, in order to assuage the population who'd been relying on rulers opposed to the French king for several generation, Louis XI granted Burgundians their own parliament. The same thing was later one granted to Britons. Everytime a king tried to secure a region within his demesne during the Early Modern Era, he created a new parliament so that people didn't have to walk all the way to Paris to appeal to him.
Yes, thank you! So it was primarily about political opposition rather than potential embarrassment. Did Louis XIV only frequent the Parisian parliament or did he travel the land to visit all of his "courts", (sort of like a HRE emperor in the middle ages would)?
Addendum. As for thrones, let's simply say that they were overrated. People prefered kings who walked among them and mingled. Richard II of England was quickly despised and hated for his obsession of sitting above and away from everybody else. He was met with a quick end. Sitting on a throne is more of a modern than a medieval thing. Same with harsh sentencing. Cutting hands and legs wasn't the go-to option for judges in the Middle Ages. The Tudors, however, were quite fond of it.
