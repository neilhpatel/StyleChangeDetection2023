Look, like I said, I hate Abbott. The world would be a better place if another tree fell on him and took him out of our lives permanently. I’m from Austin. I still have family and friends living there. I’m wicked mad that people I love are freezing right now. But this isn’t the one to be mad at Abbott about. This lies squarely and specifically on the City of Austin and Austin Energy.
But, hey, regulation isn't a correct political act, since everything is self-regulating. That's the point I was trying to make.
The failure in Austin is a hyper-local failure wherein the municipal power company, in one specific city, neglected to properly maintain their easements around their overhead power lines.
Yes. Blaming Abbott for the limbs falling is like blaming Biden for high gas prices. I wouldn't flinch if another tree fell on Abbott, but these outages are very localized and implicate poor municipal upkeep. FYI local TX gov is extremely corrupt and wasteful.
