I think the point about fascist economy to be particularly important to inform people about, as you do. It's not that fascism was against capitalism, on the contrary. Fascism just wanted to cement the positions and would have counsel with the largest companies. So the ties to how they could control the economy would be informal and situational, but mostly the companies lead themselves rather.
Fascism is a far-right, ultranationalist political ideology created by far-right conservatives disillusioned with liberal democracy after World War I. The two most memorable fascist rulers were indeed Benito Mussolini in Italy, and Adolf Hitler in Germany, who's "National Socialism" is really just considered the German interpretation of fascism. The majority of scholarship also considers Francisco Franco's "National Conservatism" of Spain to be the Spanish interpretation of fascism as well. As you can already see, what makes a government "fascist" is not what they call themselves, but how they act. There will always be debate among historians when it comes to the application of labels, especially labels for political ideologies, to governments. But I do not plan to mention any government that is not, by a great majority of scholarship, considered fascist.
