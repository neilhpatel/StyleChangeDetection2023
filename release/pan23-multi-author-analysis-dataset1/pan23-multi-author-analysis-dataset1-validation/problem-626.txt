Trust me I know the whole story is absurd. It doesn't make sense because I didn't go into full detail of everything that happened. I also thought she was involved with it. After months of questioning people, including those involved and others that knew them, we found out the entire way it went down. Their stories were too conflicting, kept changing, etc. so we both did a lot of digging.
If I've misunderstood and the issue isn't about her facing charges but the prosecutor/cops refusing to take the case seriously, your recourse is to sue the people who committed the crime. If there's enough evidence that you think the perpetrators could be convicted of the crime, that would usually mean there's more than enough to win a civil suit.
That said, if you think the prosecutor will file charges against the actual wrongdoers, letting the State pay the price of proving who did what makes it easier to recover damages. That's a decision you would make, possibly with a personal injury or civil litigation attorney.
