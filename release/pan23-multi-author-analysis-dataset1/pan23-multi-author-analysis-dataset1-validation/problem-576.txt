If the right thing makes life slightly better for a few in exchange for making life worse across the board for everyone a short time later, maybe it's not the right thing after all. The politics matter. Sometimes the likely voter reactions are too aligned against something for any representative government to enact it, no matter if it is fair or just.
I dont give a single fuck. I am tired of people saying the Dems are better than the Rs when they cant even get control of their own goddamn caucus and are actively hurting people with their garbage excuses. They dont ACTUALLY give a shit/have principles, because if they did they would nit be interfering in union contract negotiations at all. Or alternatively, if they REALLY think that railroads are that vital to our infrastructure they would have proposed a bill to nationalize the railroads. Either way, the workers get to strike, and quite frankly I also dont give a fuck if Consumerist Christmas is ruined in the name of treating workers like people instead of cattle.
