The flipside of this is that in my view a lot of the power and purpose of AskHistorians comes from its location. Academic historians do a lot more outreach than they used to, but a lot of it is about addressing the same audiences - the people who turn up to public lectures, museum exhibits, listen to specialist history programmes on the radio and so on. For historians without an existing public profile in particular, it's really hard to reach audiences who may like history, but aren't engaged through these very traditional channels of communication. Particularly given Reddit's... reputation, by being here we not only have a large audience of history buffs, but we've put ourselves front and centre in a space where history gets frequently misused. While we do get tired of questions about Hitler, it is important that solid, reliable information about subjects like the Holocaust, slavery, empire and similar is readily available on this platform.
I tried that once. The person asking was the organizer for invitations (small niche event of 90 odd attendees) I still cringe at how red I got being caught.
