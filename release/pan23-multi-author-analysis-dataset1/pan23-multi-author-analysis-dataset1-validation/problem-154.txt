This seems like WWIII now. Many wars and significant conflicts between the major countries. What the that said, The US and it's allies need to cut off the supply route and the top 100 facility players from succeeding. Needs to obviously be done militarily from the air. We shouldn't be giving Ukraine any more $ or weapons as they will very likely fall anyway. Russia is preparing a major assault by 1/2 million soldiers. They are going to attack innocent civilians as well. Need to focus on building up the Polish border, and taking out Iran. Go after the Ayatollah's regime and his military/ terrorist groups like the Revolutionary Guard. That'll get rid of that supplier and less weapons for Russia. Really need to build up NATO forces in Poland as this is about to look like the SK/NK border. Then China Taiwan problem. Then the China -America problem. In the net year, I'm saying Ukraine and Iran fall. Not the innocent people, but the Iranian regime and Zelensky. Hope I'm wrong...but it appears that's the most likely destination for all of this. After those 2 things, then who knows. If China invaded Taiwan when these situations are happening, then WWIII could escalate to the point of no return. Again, I hope I'm wrong. We need intelligent people to help come together and figure this all out. But we all know how that goes. I pray everyone gets a grip .
China is a completely other situation. I understand their frustration but too be honest if we keep saying we believe in the one china policy then when and how will China get Taiwan. This is the frustration of Xi and forcing them to work closer with Russia.
