I've mentioned these issues when they first made the policy and mentioned it again when it happened today, but was brushed aside and never heard a response. I've considered talking to HR, but to be honest I'm scared to go to my company's HR team and say "Hey you're doing an illegal thing and it affects me.".
Employers generally pay when you are asked to undergo expenses beyond the normal course of business, like flight tickets, paying for mileage for work-related driving, etc. Having normal broadband is normal but being expected to pump up your own mobile data bill would be like if your office flooded and they asked you to drive 200 miles to the other office with no extra compensation.

Every minute I spend on their issue is a minute they're not getting paid based on this new policy. That's a problem for everyone involved, not just me.
Sometimes companies create policies in good faith without realizing a possible paradoxical situation, which you've discovered. You should inform them of this.
