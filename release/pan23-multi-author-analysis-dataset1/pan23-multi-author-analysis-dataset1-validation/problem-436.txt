I'm almost 50 and when I had my first job I worked with a guy who fought with the British Army in Burma in WWII which was an awful campaign, and to some extent, forgotten. Anyway, he said he shot a superior once, one who the lads thought was incompetent and would get them killed. He said it was not the only time he knew of it happening. This was 1992ish so 50 years on from the event and so many died nothing was 'provable' so I guess he didn't give a fuck about telling me. I was just a kid, maybe I was the only person he told, who knows. I don't think he was lying.
at the beginning of the invasion, i watched hours for weeks such videos because i wanted to stay informed enough about whats happening.. i saw also a lot of bad stuff.. but i saw that it totally fucked me emotionally and i got really depressive from watching all this things.. so i decided to not watch such videos anymore & only inform myself in the news and posts - no videos or images anymore where you see gore.
Agreed. There are always going to be people with differing, and often ignorant, opinions/views - just because one is brought to your attention doesn't mean you have to react.
