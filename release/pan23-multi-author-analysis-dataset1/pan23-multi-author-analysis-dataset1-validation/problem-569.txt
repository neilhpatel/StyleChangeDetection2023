Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.
/u/crrpit is not a bot. Humans moderate this subreddit, and although we have pre-written macros that we can deploy to cover a depressingly large range of questions that we often get (e.g. Holocaust denial, anti-Semitism, American Indian genocide denial), it's quite insulting to refer to us as "bots.".
As has been noted, many of the millions of documents relating to the Holocaust and Nazism are already translated, often freely available online through organisations such as Yad Vashem or the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, or published in collections such as the Third Reich Sourcebook. They have not proved to be the final nail in denialism's coffin, precisely because denialism has never been about the pursuit of truth in good faith. Its narratives do not set out to convince an informed audience, but rather to offer superficially plausible narratives that play to an audience's ingrained skepticism at 'official' narratives (or, worse, their prejudices).
