I'd see if both MNOSHA and the health department could show up together so the manager doesn't have time to corrext anything for either. But, I don't know the practicality of that.
60 degree refrigeration is a major issue I work in a kitchen and to get even your basic food handlers card you have to know that 41 degrees is the maximum temp the walk-in can be... 60 is disgusting I’m positive the food is rotting and festering if that’s what they regularly keep it at and if they’re serving it they don’t care about their customers or making people sick and it definitely seems like their ok with making their employees work until they become ill... I’m not too sure what she can do about them not scheduling her if I was her I would record how hot it is in there at certain points of the day and take pictures of the broken AC and FOR SURE report the walk-in to the health department because that is so gross.
Yes. Heat stroke should always be treated by a doctor. Once someone gets to that level of dehydration, it is very hard to rehydrate orally. There are many other effects heat stroke can have that may last much longer than the actual heat stroke. It can mess with the heart and lungs for example. You are also more likely to have it again when you have had it in the recent past. I would contact the worker’s compensation company/insurance every single time! The restaurant will be more likely to address this issue once it starts hitting them in their back pocket.
