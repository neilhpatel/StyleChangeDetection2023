I think one thing that could be done would be legislation forcing the cable companies to provide “a la carte” packages where you only pay for the channels that you watch. I don’t want to get too in the weeds on the business side of cable news but currently Fox News receives payment from every single person who subscribes to cable or live streaming. This is true of all channels but Fox actually pulls in the second most money of any cable channel other than ESPN. What this means is that Fox doesn’t rely on advertisers to generate revenue. I think “a la carte” packages however would force cable news channels to attempt to appeal to more people or to actually offer real and actual news to people that is worth paying for.
I really think the most effective thing that can be done is passing legislation that would force cable companies to offer channels "a la carte." These channels get so much money from being included in packages that everyone is forced to buy. If you take that away I could see cable news getting back to actually trying to offer the service of "news" instead of nothing but opinion hosts trying to be more and more outrageous to generate eyeballs.
4. What would you say to people who claim that mainstream media is 'Fake News", biased, and that they never know 'who to trust?'.
If a non-American academic approached you and asked you to identify the best non-partisan, independent media outlets in America, what would you recommend?
Hey! Do you know how a big news outlet gets their news first-hand about not-so-central stuff (East Palestine derailment), how fast do they get there?
