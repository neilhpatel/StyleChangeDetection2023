NFT’s have zero value aside from people selling them and trying to not be the last one holding the bag. They rose to popularity based on fraudulent “sales” where people were buying and selling them to themselves to make them look valuable and like there was high demand for monkey pictures. You can’t do anything with an NFT and we have seen their value plummet to earth because enough dumb people bought them that there are not enough dumb people left to pass them on to. These people are referred to as bag holders, they’re the same as when people buy a coin with zero utility at its peak or worse when the people who created it are about to sell everything and crash the market.

Seriously. I went on R/conservative when the ntfs were announced and most of the commenters were annoyed and agreed it was dumb af. I doubt the sales are through his “supporters” and is most likely blatant money laundering.
