Enough has been said about how Guns, Germs and Steel is criticized by many historians in previous posts, but to talk more specifically about the differences of Why Nations Fail and how it considers geography, it does so not as an independent variable like Jared Diamond does (i.e. the idea that rivers and mountain ranges dictate a society) but instead as a means to facilitating or hindering the growth of institutions (which can be completely independent of geographic constraints, or dependent on them).
So do I! This is my favorite case study to cite when I explain the merits of postmodernism for scientific research. Cause it gives the most killer wrap-up:
Intriguing! As I understand it, a similar system occurred after the Act of Union in Scotland, with the Lairds of each clan having to attend in London for a set amount of time each year. While it was more a kind of geographic luck, this also impacted heavily on the Highland clans, both because they were more distant, and also because they had more terrain to cross with fewer good roads. It was eventually revised to convening in Edinburgh, at least as far as I remember from reading The Highland Clearances by TM Devine.
Hahaha! Well, the biology isn’t all that strong either, so maybe, just maybe, it is an overrated book. To be honest, I started reading it because I had heard so much about it I felt I should, but it was so annoying I couldn’t get more than a few chapters in, so please don’t ask me for a detailed critique.
1. There's some fun irony to the popular misconception about what the butterfly effect says. Everybody knows that the butterfly effect tends to be articulated using some variation on the question: "can a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil create a tornado in Texas?". But the general public tends to assume that the answer is yes. Or more commonly, they tend to express the question as a statement of fact: "a butterfly flapping its wings in Tokyo can create a hurricane in New York." Whereas in actuality, the answer is a resounding no. Which is kinda obvious. Let's reframe that question for a moment. Can a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil create a tornado in New York City? Probably not. The world has a lot of butterflies in it, and very few tornados hit New York. So there's definitely something predictable to the dynamics of these systems, and there's definitely a limit to predictability. The question is: where do we search to find the edge between predictability and unpredictability? The genius and beauty to 'the butterfly effect' isn't that it provides a surprising answer to the question of whether chaos is unsolvable. Rather, the genius and beauty lies in how the obvious answer to the question is arrived at. You see, at the edge between predictability and unpredictability there exists a fascinating discovery. Chaos features a very particular type of structure called a strange attractor, which is distinct from other types of attraction in complex systems. It is near impossible to determine how a given system will operate while on a strange attractor, but the dynamics of the strange attractor are highly predictable across all systems. In my opinion, the strange attractor is quite simply one of the most beautiful concepts in mathematics. There's a beautiful paradox at play: chaotic systems are actually highly ordered. Perhaps a system containing the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil will also contain a tornado in Texas. But the predictability of the tornado has nothing to do with the flap of the butterfly's wings, and everything to do with the properties of the strange attractor at play in that system.
