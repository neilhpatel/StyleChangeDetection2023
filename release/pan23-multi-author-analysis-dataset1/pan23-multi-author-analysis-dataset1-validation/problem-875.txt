This was for example the first time in 5 years that the Japanese government used the term 'illegal occupation' when referring to the four islands in official public communication.
Seriously. Russia turned out to be so fucking weak that the Japanese military could easily reclaim it and give them a good fight.
Illegally occupying? Japan lost the war, and thus lost the right to these islands. Russia has been doing a lot to allow Japanese people onto there even if they aren't actually Japanese islands anymore. There is illegal occupation like Crimea or Donetsk, but unlike Ukraine, Hokkaido was not occupied by the Russians. It was lost in actual war, with Japan as the actual bad guys. Hitler and his allies were not good people.
It wouldn't be settling a territorial dispute militarily, they would just be preforming a Special Military Operation on those islands. Totally different.
At some point in time after WWII, Japan and the US decided that some islands in the chain do not belong to the Kurils. The Soviet Union has always rejected this and consequently held on to all of the islands. Russia has inherited this stance.
