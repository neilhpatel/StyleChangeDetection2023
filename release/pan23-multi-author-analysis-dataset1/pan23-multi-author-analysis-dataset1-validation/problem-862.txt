Tenancy in common is the default manner of taking the title â€“ if there is no evidence that the real estate was supposed to be conveyed as a joint tenancy, then title is held as a tenancy in common.
Assuming you got an actual copy of the deed that was recorded putting your father and his girlfriend in title, and assuming that there is no joint tenancy language of any kind whatsoever in it, then I believe it is very probable that the property was held legally as tenants in common because the words tenants in common do not have to be stated on the deed.
As for the home, the mortgage doesn't matter. Do you happen to know whose name(s) are on the deed/title of the home? Do you know how they are listed? There's really no other way to guess what your rights are to the property without seeing that information. If the home was listed for sale it may make sense to shoot an e-mail to the Realtor listing the home to notify them that you don't know if you have a claim to the property and to speak to an estate attorney ASAP.
