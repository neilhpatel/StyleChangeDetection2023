If you have a migraine and you can't come in to work, you can stay home unpaid and your job is protected when you use FMLA.
Your company may also be thinking "If she's too impaired by a migraine to drive to work on these days, why should we pay her to 'work from home' those days? How can she can get anything done working from home on those days if she's having migraines that prevent her from driving?".
Permanently working from home is almost never going to be found to be a reasonable accommodation by the courts, unless the vast majority of your similarly situated coworkers also work from home.
That's not a bad argument. Here's what you need to consider though. A lot of companies want employees to return to the office and a lot of employees don't want to do that. Any companies are going to hold the line on the various demands/requests they are getting from employees begging and pleading to work from home forever.
And some companies might be concerned that if they grant your request to work from home 100% of the time forever due to migraines, this will undermine morale and perhaps lead to future requests from employees claiming migraines and demanding the same accommodation.
And if your migraines are very frequent, leaving you debilitated 2-3 days a week, then a court may find that your request to work from home 2-3 days a week isn't reasonable and would be an undue hardship on the company.
All very good points. Sorry I should have said that I was only requesting the WFH days when I was unable to drive.
