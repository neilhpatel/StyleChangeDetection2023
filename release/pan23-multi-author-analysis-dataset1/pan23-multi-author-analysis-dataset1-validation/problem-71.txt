Mentioning a civil suit is not extortion. It is my right to file if they do not cooperate by providing their insurance information, and to try to reach a compromise with LL. I suspect they are trying to remove the tree before their insurance company can be contacted. I'm ok with that, it needs to go before someone gets killed, but afterward, if USAA cannot attempt to collect from their insurance company, if they wish to do so, my only recourse to get my deductible back would be to sue or work out a compromise.
Do you have this tree report? You also say in your post that your husband did know that the tree was dead before it fell and he still chose to park his car right beside it. By parking there and not somewhere else, the landlord could argue comparative negligence. In premises liability, you are expected to exercise a reasonable degree of judgement and perception. By choosing to park the car where he did despite being put on notice that the giant tree near his car could fall over soon, he could be found to be a partial cause.
