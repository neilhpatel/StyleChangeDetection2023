All i really want to see is no russians allowed to cross the borders from russia and russia to get even harsher sanctions until they openly denounce the war crimes and send the perpetrator's to the hauge or even better to ukriane courts to be punsihed.
This. People tend to forget that in Russia, the rules of pretty much the ex-Soviet Union apply. You speak ill/stand up against the interests of the state, you still get fucked beyond belief, and your family, too.
Psychologically it's supposedly to terrorise Ukraine into surrender. Militarily it's to make them devote more resources to clearing the damage, to force Ukraine to move anti missile batteries away from the front lines and into cities and to make Ukraine use up its missiles on defence as well. What most commentators feel is the primary reason, though, is that the war is going so badly for Russia that nationalist groups in Russia are criticising the government and the military. Destroying civilian targets is a way for Russia to show those nationalists that it's doing something successfully instead of just getting its butt kicked on the front lines.
Unfortunately thats exactly whats happening. Very small amount of russians actually assimilates into new socities. Most of the time they just want to enjoy quality of western life, while still having all the shitty beliefs of the russian culture. I knew a russian woman (she worked together with my mother), that had a great job in USA, she ran away from Russia cause she hated government... and she STILL excused Crimea annexation. Thats how fucked up they are. No matter what horrible things Putin would do, they would still support him just cause "its my country".
