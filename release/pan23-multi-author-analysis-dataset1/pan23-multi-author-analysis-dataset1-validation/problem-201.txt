Well actually they are not, the mourners came for her, the brother wished to put her in the hearse, the mourners said they wished to carry her as a martyr, before the brother got to respond to them the police started attacking the mourners and almost destroyed the casket then a settlement was reached in which her casket was carried over the shoulder then put in the hearse in which they were attacked again due to the presence of palestinian flags.
the money Israel receives from the US is about 0.5% of GDP. Israel does not need it, and has wanted to cancel it in the past. But it is a 2 way agreement. The US gets a lot of jobs as most of it needs to be spent in the US, as well as a foothold for various military uses in Israel itself.
