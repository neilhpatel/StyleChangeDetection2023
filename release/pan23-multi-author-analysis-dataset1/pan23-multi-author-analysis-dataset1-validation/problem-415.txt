> When the film was released an FBI spokesperson acknowledged that Abagnale had given lectures at the Academy "from time to time," but denied that Abagnale had been given commendations by the agency as claimed in the film's marketing.[100] At no point has the FBI made an official statement corroborating Abagnale's biographical claims, nor has the agency confirmed his extraordinary claims that he was sent into a military base as an expert on missiles, and into a secret lab in New Mexico.[46][101] Abagnale has claimed in public lectures that he was discussed in detail in a coffee table book celebrating 100 years of the FBI.[46] However, Abagnale's name does not appear anywhere in the official book celebrating 100 years of the FBI.[102] In his public lectures Abagnale has taken on a pseudo-spokesperson role for the FBI. In discussing recruitments he states, "we take 1 in 10,000 applications."[46] However, there are 11,500 applications per year for 900 positions at the FBI (2018) - which is 1 in 13 applicants, not 1 in 10,000.[103].

The traditional education system of school, colleges and university is slowly being rendered obsolete by the internet, which is why internet has granted SO many careers, that doesn't require even the tiniest bit of institutional tutelage.
Honestly thanks for this. I do pee in the shower often (I live alone, and I clean my shower constantly). Recently i've noticed urges to pee ALL the time i hear water and my bladder control seems really bad because im not using my pelvic floor muscles to hold it. When im out an about I have to find bathrooms way more often. So honestly, thanks for this. Good Doctor. I will stop peeing in the shower.
But yeah, go ahead and preach about an antiquated institution that has only been about dividing class systems, creating an uncontested market and putting smart genius savants such as yourself into debt, you're becoming obsolete just like the factory workers.
