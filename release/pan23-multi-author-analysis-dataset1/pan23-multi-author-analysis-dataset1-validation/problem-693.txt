That, and Canada's refusal to accept the rest of the world's consensus that the NW Passage is in fact, an international strait (still Canadian territorial waters where all resources within it are the rights of Canada, but it means it's a body of water that links to bodies of international water together, and that would allow ships of any nation to be able to sail through it under the right of transit passage). It's akin to if Turkey tried to say "well the Bosphorous Strait is within our territorial bounds, so no one can traverse it at all", which is very much illegal per Article 37 of UNCLOS. That's why the US vetoed the plan for the UK to build Canada nuclear attack submarines in the 1980s. That refusal to accept the NW Passage for what it is, and subsequently fucking the US east coast and Europe with tanker and cargo ship sailing times (going through the Panama Canal vs the NW Passage triples the trip duration), is another huge reason Canada got left out.
Very good points. Australia is a much more strategic partner for where the US is directing its diplomacy. No offense Canada...I personally still love you but the US govt dosent let me make policy.
The thing that gets missed in that conversation, is that the passage is incredibly treacherous, culturally significant, and ecologically sensitive.
Not true. Toronto and Ottawa are closer to me than most US states. Like 90% of Canadians are super close to the US border. I’m not saying you guys are de facto US states but… it sometimes feels like it ngl.
