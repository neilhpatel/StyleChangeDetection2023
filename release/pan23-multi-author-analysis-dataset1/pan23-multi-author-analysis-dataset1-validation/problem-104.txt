The fact that you got an award here is baffling. Why would America be altruistic in it’s foreign affairs? The government’s 1 job is protecting and defending the interests of its citizens. Every western country loves the world order and free trade that our navy and Air Force allows for, our counter-terrorism intelligence, and protection of Allies. While the rest of the west shakes our hand, they also give us the finger as we’re walking away. So fucking annoying and hypocritical. I lived in Europe for years and we catch a ton of flak from your smug asses.

Absolutely. It's pretty much how every nation _should_ behave. I don't think there is anything bad about it, it's just rational. Not criticizing that.
Interesting. Somebody took and posted a video of a load of tanks on a train passing through here in downtown Denver this morning. Wonder if this is related, because that is not a normal occurrence here.
