Third winter now with the rattly HVAC above my room loudly humming and vibrating. And Iâ€™m not sure if the building management will get around to it, the last time they just said it was old but itâ€™s gotten so loud I can barely sleep. As well as the management staff now changing every three months or so. Also got a dish chair last week that collapsed under me this week, so Iâ€™m not in the best of moods.(that one really hurt).
This morning I've got a two-hour session with my personal trainer I have run training which is just over 5KS and then Max reap training for Bench Press at the start of this circuit which was 8 weeks ago the max I could bench was 70KGs so going to be really interested to see how much I've improved.
I got hungry for potato salad. I haven't had it in ages. So I made a huge bowl of simple potato salad to eat with meals this weekend. I did eat a whole bowl of it for lunch. By itself. ðŸ˜‚.
Afternoon plan to play some Halo Infinite with some mates I've got a regular group of 4 to play it with and as long as you play during peak hours it's a lot of fun, too bad the game diddn't launch in the state it's in now it'd be a completely different story.
