They use more or less same discourse for almost every massacre. Their main idea is that Turkey was a newly founded republic and the Kurds were provoked by imperialists - mainly Brits, therefore the state officials ordered fierce attacks for the survival of the young republic.".
"Madrasahs were closed, the Ministry of Religious and Foundations was abolished, and religious schools were connected to the National Education. Some irreligious writers in the newspapers dare to insult religion and insult our Prophet. If I could today, i would personally start fighting and strive for the promotion of religion.".
During the War of Independence, Mustafa Kemal promised the Kurds an autonomous Kurdistan and 1921 Constitution is a clear indicator that the Kurdish autonomy was accepted by the parliament. However, there were some anti-Ankara Kurds rebelled in regions such as Sivas (Koçgiri Rebellion is the most known one). Things got changed after the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. The 1924 Constitution was a U-turn in the Turkish discourse and amendments related to autonomy was ommitted. The Kurds were in fear of facing the same fate of Armenians and rebelled against the Ankara goverment. There were already small rebellions in some Kurdish cities yet in 1925 the biggest one - Sheikh Said Rebellion - erupted mainly in surroundings of Diyarbakır.
Yet, the series of Kurdish rebellions continued and the second one erupted in 1927 - as it is known Ararat Rebellion. I'm not gonna make detailed explanations but Zilan Massacre in 1930 is the most notorious one during those days. The estimated number according to a German newspaper was 4.500 civilians.
