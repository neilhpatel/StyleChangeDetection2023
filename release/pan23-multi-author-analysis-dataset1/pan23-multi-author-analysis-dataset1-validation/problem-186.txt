I am assuming that your grandmother worked for the government? So she had a TSP? That is different than life insurance from a private company. More than a 14 year old would know.
my grandma wasn't good about her finances at all so the life insurance plan was given to me because im the only next of kin that was still alive, the estate and her funeral were paid for by her retirement money and pension i believe. i don't know too much about the life insurance plan all i know is that it's called a thrift savings plan and there was no beneficiary. my mom wasn't a beneficiary since she's not related to my grandma, the only reason she had access to the money is because im a minor and i had to have an adult on my bank account. i saw the document the company mailed to us, and im not sure if this means anything but the check they sent was made out to me and none of it said anything about my mom. most of the time though she wasn't using my money for things that had anything to do with me, she would play her own credit card bills and buy things for herself. but once she took the last 30k away i have no idea what she spent it on because she took my name off it.
