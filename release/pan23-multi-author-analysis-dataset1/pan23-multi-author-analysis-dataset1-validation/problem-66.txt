First and foremost, call your insurance carrier -- if you've been billed, they were probably billed too, and they will be very interested to know that the surgery never took place and will probably be able to provide you with more paperwork that you can use to build up a case.
On your note with Lasik. If the doc was any decent he would have given you a reason to why it's not possible. If a second opinion is still a no, I reccomend getting ICL surgery. They slide contacts right under your eyes skin. In 10 years if your vision changes you can have the contacts removed and redone.
If the consultation mentioned any controlled substances such as valium/diazepam or an opioid painkiller, do a consultation appointment with a lawyer and ask them if it's a good idea to involve law enforcement -- controlled substances are very carefully tracked, and if the surgeon listed the procedure as having been complete he could be concealing a surplus, which is very illegal.
Lawyer here. I am not your lawyer. You should consult a lawyer who knows your local law. Under federal law, there is a unfair trade practices law. In my state, there is a mirrored state law for those actions which don't fall under the federal trade practices purview (which this probably wouldn't). I would seek out a lawyer who specializes or deals with consumer side litigation. If your state has the same law (state legislatures tend to copy other state legislatures actions) you can get attorneys fees if you win, which makes an attorney willing to take a case like this on contingency.
IANAL. That is correct. It's not uncommon for sleazier collection agencies to try and bank on the fact that most people do not know their rights with debt and collections. They will try any tactic they can (even some that are less than legal) to get you to make a payment because once you do that, you are on the hook.
