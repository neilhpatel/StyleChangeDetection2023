In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
True. I was just reading a wapo story about the head of the republican caucus (Jeffries was head of the Democratic caucus). Wapo calls him a moderate yet he refused in an an interview to even say it was wrong for trump to say the Constitution should be terminated. And he would still support him if he's the repub nominee. Because he's afraid of speaking out against the mob.

Cool. Makes pulling down another historic win in 2024 that much easier. GOP should've realized people want a party that's actually interested in governing and not some bullshit dog and pony show after their ass kicking in November, but they didn't and they won't.
