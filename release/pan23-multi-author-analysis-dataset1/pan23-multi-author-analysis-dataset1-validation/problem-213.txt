Unless you’re trying to publish research I wouldn’t worry about it. The best way to get good at this method is to read several works on the same subject, analyze whether there is bias, check for footnotes or endnotes, and just have fun with reading.
hypothesis. Now that you've done some of the leg work, familiarized yourself with the historical grounds, as it were, you're ready to advance your theory. Why did people believe that Stanley Kubrick faked the moon landing? Maybe it's because the US was desperate for a "win" in the Cold War and manufactured a triumphant achievement they could use to reinvigorate nationalistic support for the US during the worst phases of the Vietnam War (this is all fake, btw, please don't take this seriously). Now, armed with a hypothesis, you can go back to more research.
ANy recommendations on books about historiography? Great post, man, it helped me alot. Thanks so, so much.
So, if you want to get the historical rigor/style you seek, read more journal articles (which are the tip of the spear of new history), break apart those journal articles to observe methodology (a dirty secret of grad school is half the time they don't teach you methodology, you're just forced under the gun to have some), and think about what history subject you can devote a specialty to in order to produce your own academic articles.
Yes. History is a process, like science. You can learn and apply the process regardless of your level of training, so long as you understand its components. The formula isn't much different than the scientific method, but it uses research instead of experimentation (although sometimes experimentation can make up an element of the research). The process usually looks like:
I acquired my historiographical and critical theory knowledge however I could, via comic books, podcasts, academic books, youtube videos, but most importantly, engagement here and elsewhere with academics until I could hold my own.
Ask a question. The question doesn't need to be deep or complex, in fact some very simple questions can lead to a total adjustment of the earlier historiography. The question usually starts with "why" but that isn't a hard and fast rule. Be careful of questions that limit your framing. Something like "why did Kubrick fake the moon landing" contains some assumptions that need to be addressed first, and likewise "how did Kubrick fake the moon landing" might lead to a highly technical and unsatisfying answer (if you make it past the obvious hurdle to this question). A better question in this absurd instance might be "why do some people believe that Stanley Kubrick helped fake the moon landing?".
I also emphasize style because this is a known weak point in academia, that in certainly less rigorously peer-reviewed corners of humanities journals, the right style will get you published even if the substance behind that style was fabricated.
let's talk about big scary bias. As said above, your question will lead to making a choice about your framework, your methodology, and will invoke particular theories that will be helpful in answering your question. It will lead to a selection of your evidence, and possibly bring in evidence from fields outside history. All of this is a bias. You're asking a limiting question and using tools that select evidence that best helps answer the question. Knowing your bias and working with its strenhs while understanding the limitations of the bias is a very important part of historical work. It's another thing that separates historians from pop-history producers. The latter can sometimes lean too heavily on what they consider "facts" as if the entire field of history isn't about interpreting those facts using specific tools to answer specific questions. Facts are great and helpful, but it takes interpretation before they can say anything. And it must be said that a great deal of what pop-history people advance as fact is, quite often, a theoretical interpretation of certain facts. Presenting an interpretation as a hardbound "fact" is problematic not only in that it skews the audience's perception of events, but limits the understanding of the mechanical elements of history: namely, that history is at its core interpretation of evidence. Even curation of evidence is interpretation. In other words, if I merely present a parade of facts that are all agreed to be true to the best of our knowledge, even the fact that I have removed them from context and put them in a particular order for a particular presentation is an interpretation, and therefore has a bias and methodology that should be scrutinized.
I think we’ve all been there friend. I have that issue with every paper I write. I’ve had to seek out groups within and external to my university to help me form a research argument, topic, proofread, etc just about every paper I’ve ever written.
