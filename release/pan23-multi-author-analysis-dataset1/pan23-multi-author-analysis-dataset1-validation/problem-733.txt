Moving to why the Prime Meridian was set at Greenwich, a major problem of railway scheduling in the 1850s and onward was that trains were relatively fast -- speaking of America, they could cross the continent in enough time that they would run into one another if there were not conversions for local time and "time zones" like we have today. The result of the International Meridian Conference in 1884 was fairly pre-ordained, with the prime meridian being at Greenwich being accepted by the Anglophiles at the conference, due at least partially to the prominence of the British navy and its influence on navigation on the terraqueous globe. (To be _extremely_ technical about it, the current International Reference Meridian is slightly to the east of Greenwich, due to variances in local gravity; also, to be _less_ technical about it, the Earth is kind of lumpy and doesn't rotate at a steady rate, so leap-seconds are sometimes inserted to keep clocks in time.).
Several nations had their own prime meridian, with the most notable ones being the Meridian of Paris (you can still find brass buttons in the streets of Paris indicating its location) and obviously the one that runs through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich (very close to, but not perfectly in the middle of London). Ships from different nations used to log their positions on the globe using their respective Prime Meridians, until eventually, in October 1884, the Greenwich Meridian was selected to be the common zero of longitude AND the standard of time reckoning all throughout the world.
