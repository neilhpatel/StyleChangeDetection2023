Communism had broad popular support in most of Europe immediately after the war, maybe not a majority in most places but a substantial number of people in post-war elections and power struggles supported the communists.
Very interesting! I did know that Finland throughout the cold war kept fairly close ties to both the west and the east but didn't know about the SKDL or any of those developments.
Yeah, it's...complicated. Immediately after the war, the US and UK governments had consigned Finland as a lost cause, certain to fall to communists and perhaps even be annexed by the USSR. However, when this did not happen, Finland became a cold war battleground where Moscow funded the communist party and its fellow travelers, and Washinon and London the Social Democrats, and to a smaller extent other non-communists. A LOT of post-war political wrangling in Finland's foreign and trade relations were affected by this struggle: both sides dangled lucrative trade agreements or other deals as prizes to be won if the Finns voted for the "right" party. (Of course, never openly - but Finnish politicians could and did tell the voters that "WE are the guarantee that this or that concession will happen/this bad thing does not happen"-) Moscow generally had an upper hand in this game, being in a position not only to do trade deals but also to ease the onerous "war reparations" and to give other important concessions, such as leasing the important Saimaa channel, which connected Finland's largest lake system Saimaa to the sea, but whose southern end in Viipuri had been ceded in the peace treaty. (This is, by the way, the last such lease agreement in the world, after Hong Kong and Macao reverted to China.).
The main reason for this is the political establishment of these countries was pretty thoroughly destroyed among the former axis powers and the countries which had been pro-axis or axis occupied during the war. The political forces which emerged were generally those who had resisted fascism during the war.
