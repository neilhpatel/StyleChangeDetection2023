BRICS is not even an alliance or anything. It’s not as if BRICS would be taking a side, it’d be each individual country. And I don’t know if any of those countries are taking Russia’s side. As far as I know, only North Korea has sent military assistance to Russia.
Hyperbole. Summits are ubiquituous with nations that have even just average relations with one another. Like others said, territirial disputes are better measures. China and India are not allies. Add to that strong measures by India to ban countless Chinese products.
Unsurprisingly, given the retrograde position of Lula's party (and himself) that are very sympathetic to Russia due its history as the core nation of Soviet Union and their world view are painted in the most outmoded anti-Americanism and anti-Western world possible.
Only helping the sea level to rise. I wonder how funny people will find it twenty years from now. There's nearly 400 million living at sea level in India where the level is rising faster along their coastlines than anywhere else in the world... 5 of their most populous cities will be experiencing continuous major flooding as soon as 2030. Couple that with severe drought and food disparity, climate change is going to piss all over Asia from the southern most part of India to the northern most part of China like nowhere else. I wonder where all those displaced people will go and how India will deal with all of that lost tax revenue? I'm sure that one of Indias autocratic BRICS partners will be happy to help them out. LOL!
