The National Defense University Press published an outstanding article called Mercenaries and War: Understanding Private Armies Today (online: PDF: ) that sheds an enormous amount of light on why mercenaries are effective, or at the very least why they have used throughout history:
Ninth, while there is somewhat of a modern stigma surrounding the idea of fighting for pay, mercenaries have always been a fact of war (even appearing in the Bible) and that the historical line between national soldiers and mercenaries is a little bit blurrier than one might think. Military service didn't become linked to nationalism and patriotism the way we think of it today (i.e. "serving your country" by joining up) until the Napoleonic Wars, while money has always been a motive for fighting whether it's loot and ransom on the ancient/medieval battlefield or enlistment bonuses and pensions on the modern one. "People view soldiers like wives and mercenaries as prostitutes, who turn love into a transaction. But every soldier has a little mercenary in him, and vice versa. Troops often reenlist for big bonuses, a transactional practice common in most militaries." On the other side of the coin, mercenaries are not so...mercenary in their acceptance of contracts as you might think: "The author has also seen mercenaries refuse jobs on political grounds. Some American-hired guns will never take money from Russia, China, Iran, or a terrorist group; Americaâ€™s enemies are their enemies.".
As far as what they're doing right now is mostly standing army and police work but also defending on of the borders that has a lot of messed up stuff going on with one of the countries, and I'm basing that border on something I saw on a documentary about an approach to a fort that was littered with irregular ditches, big and small rocks, and a somewhat narrow and winding path up to the fort so things like supply trains could get there - I can't remember which hill fort it was tho!
You're welcome. I love worldbuilding too (I love James Tullos, Hello Future Me, and Terrible Writing Advice, do you know any good ones for me?), and your idea is certainly original for a fantasy world. If you have any worldbuilding tips for me or want more military questions answered I'm happy to reply or DM.
