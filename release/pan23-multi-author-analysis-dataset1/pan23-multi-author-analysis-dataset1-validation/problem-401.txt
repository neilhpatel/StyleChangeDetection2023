Covers helped sell the pulps; while the interiors were cheap paper with black-and-white illustrations or poor photographic prints, the covers were vibrant, full-colored affairs. Artists were churning out luscious princesses, curvaceous demons, and bound damsels in distress every month during the 1920s and 30s; and even the occasional nude figure advertised the adventures of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Cimmerian or C. L. Moore's Jirel of Joiry in Weird Tales. This trend was taken to an extreme in the Spicy pulps, which catered directly to an adult market, though their fiction was not fantastic, and even the science fiction and fantasy pulps like Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror, Amazing Stories, Wonder Stories, and Unknown Worlds had limitations on how far they would suggest sex in their pages.
All of this. The short summary is: The pulp fantasy developed alongside the "high" fantasy, and even predated it. Burroughs and Howard were getting published long before Tolkien.
Frank Frazetta's choice for a less-clothed figure with more impressive, defined musculature really comes out of the artistic depictions of Tarzan - he wasn't alone in pursuing the use of bodybuilder aesthetic at the time, although I'm not sure I have the sources to talk about the wider commercial art trends - comic books, for example, had been pursuing more defined musculature and bare skin with characters like the Incredible Hulk (1962), and the costumes of characters like Superman were directly inspired from those of strong men of the 1930s, whose "Physical Culture" scene is the direct antecedent of modern bodybuilding.
Thanks for the reply! I never knew that there were different schools, much less the difference before them. I also didn't bother to think about "fantasy before Tolkien" even though I knew it existed.
Interesting. Was there any relationship between the rise of muscular men on the covers of fantasy novels/comic books and the gay pulp fiction that began to be published in the late-‘40s and early-‘50s?
