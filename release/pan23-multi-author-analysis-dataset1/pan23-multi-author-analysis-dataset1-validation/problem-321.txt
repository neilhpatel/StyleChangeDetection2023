This would be option a or b. We were told the repair was completed and we refrained from using the bathroom due to the wet carpeting in the hall surrounding the bathroom because maintenace was due back the next day to replace the wet carpeting.
B. If downstairs neighbors dont have renters insurance they will most likely have to sue you in regular court (30k will be way above small claims court) this will require real lawyers and will such cost a considerable amount on the neighbors end and might not be worth their time or money if you have nothing of value yourself.
And I think I did help. But I know of at least one instance where I made a seemingly innocuous mistake that could’ve cost thousands of dollars if OP acted on what I said. I had worked in the field I knew what I was talking about But I made a mistake that went uncorrected. This kind of thing happens every day on this sub. Usually, it’s caught and downvoted to oblivion. Sometimes it’s not. Mine wasn’t.
Additionally, even if some how you were responsible for this, which I highly doubt, you would only be responsible for cost of mitigation, the depreciated value of replacement of what was damaged, and labor. Further, apartment buildings are laid out the way they are with bathrooms over bathrooms and laundry rooms over laundry rooms specifically to minimize the cost of the build and minimize damage from flooding. If they failed to mitigate (call our ServPro, Stanley Steemer, or other water cleanup specialist), their own insurance company would likely even deny them for their own negligence in failing to mitigate damage and you would be even less responsible.
