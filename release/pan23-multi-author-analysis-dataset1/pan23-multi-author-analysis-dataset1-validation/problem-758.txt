Your landlord may not interfere with your and your co-tenants' reasonable enjoyment, and in Ontario that means they can't stop you-collectively from having an off-lease roommate. Your landlord is also not allowed to _unreasonably_ withhold consent to a lease assignment, which would formally substitute someone else for you on the lease. Wanting to meet someone when they did not meet you might be unreasonable, but the bigger issue is that there isn't a lot of case law suggesting that they must consent to assignment of only part of a lease. Saying they'll allow assignment if your roommates are on board, but not otherwise, is not completely unreasonable taken as a whole, and I can't find a Board ruling that would suggest otherwise. (u/londontenant, do you have any insights to add here?).
I am going to be the one to initiate the search for someone to take over my room/lease, but once I get any candidates I plan to make sure itâ€™s completely up to my roommates to decide who they want to live with, so hopefully that alleviates the tension.
I honestly don't know. Joint tenancies are so complicated. I was under the impression that you couldn't sublet or assign a partial tenancy -- i.e. that you could only sublet or assign if everyone on the lease was vacating, but this may not be the case.
