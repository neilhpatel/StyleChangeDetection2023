I picked it out of a box of books someone was getting rid of 20 years ago, and I never actually read it. Part of why I kept it is because I mistakenly thought it was a signed copy of Paul Tibbets' memoir! Anyway apparently Sweeney's book (which was ghostwritten by two other authors) is incredibly controversial and factually disputed, even by Tibbets, so even though part of me kept it for all these years because of some supposed historic value, I'm kind of wondering if I actually just got rid of a monkey's paw/cleaned my karma out a bit.
2,813 [Great Question!] "Traditional" English food is stereotyped as bland and unhealthy. But I've heard the popularity of this style of food is a consequence of rationing in WWI and WWII. What was home English cooking like in the 1890s-1900s? Did WWI/WWII change it?
Two notes, though: 1) it displays [removed] comments, so some of the results you'll find won't be approved by the mods, and 2) because the standards of quality answers changed around 2014 or 2015, approved answers from before weren't always as good, so be weary of the particularly older threads you dig up. (In fact, I tend to filter comments to only include responses from within the last six years.).
The advent of modern wall to wall carpets made of machine produced tufted carpet held to the floor permanently with tack strips dates back only to the 1950s, which is after vacuum cleaners started to become commonly available.
Fitted carpets weren't really a thing for ordinary people until more modern times when electrification and vacuum cleaners were common. Previously carpets were woven pieces of fabric you'd just lay on top of the floor. To clean them you'd move the furniture off them, take them outside, lay them over something and beat them with something to get the dust out. You could also use water and soap potentially, if the carpet was stained, but depending on the size and construction of the carpet this may require special care. Folks who had fitted carpets in the 19th century would have had staff who could do the laborious work of taking up the carpets (which might be very large) and cleaning them regularly.
