I mean it feels like a catch-22. If the US acknowledges and has relations with a government, it’s their fault that government did bad things and why didn’t they stop him. If the US does something to depose a government, it’s a colonizing imperialist who’s undermining political stability and causing strife. On one hand it feels like you’re blaming the US for occupying Haiti, then you’re mad the US didn’t overthrow Haiti’s government. You can’t really have both, though.
We actively supported Papa Doc because he allowed US corporations to prosper, and before that we occupied and opened the market to those corporations which took profits outside the country. I was not saying we should have deposed the Duvaliers, and do not have a problem with peacekeeping forces we had there in the 90s, but we have some of the blame. I was certainly not saying internal corruption or the French played no role. And unrelated to any of those situations, Haiti is also in a geographical situation where earthquakes and hurricanes are common. There is a constellation of factors.
While the US’ and France’s actions didn’t help the young country get off to a good start, even The NY Times article written about its colonial history acknowledges Haiti’s largest budget expenditure for a long time was its military and political instability combined with rife corruption have played a tremendous role in Haiti’s plight. There are a lot of factors at play, even if it’s easy to just go “lol US bad France bad”.
