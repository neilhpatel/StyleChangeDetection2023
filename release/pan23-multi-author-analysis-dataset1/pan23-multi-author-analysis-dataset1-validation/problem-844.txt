Its not relevant. But I used to do drug testing, and I was clarifying the science part cuz I was annoyed that _Bob_A_Feet_ said that employers use mass spectrometry to detect everything. There's way more to it. You need a chromatography system (ie gas chromatograpy, liquid chromatography, etc) attached to the mass spec. And yea, you can detect almost everything, but drug testing labs only look for certain ions that are used to determine the presence of a drug. The point of the mass spec is to filter out the ions you need to determine presence. Without knowing those ions for those drugs, you dont actually know what you have in thr sample you're testing and lose out on efficiency. The method used on the GCMS or LCMSMS also varies from drug to drug; one method could run a sample in 5min to detect cocaine, but take 20min to detect meth.You also need to factor in the extraction method used on the sample. There isnt a universal extraction method used to detect all drugs. So one person's sample could be split into different portions so that they can test for multiple drugs; one extracrion method could destroy the cocaine in the sample, but be used to help pull opiates. Just because a sample is postive in the preliminary test, doesnt mean it will always be postive in the confirmatory test. GCMS/LCMSMS are considered confirmatory methods, but for something to be truly postive, the result has to be above the limit of detection and limit of quantitation and the minimum thresold of what is considered postive for that drug (different drugs have different acceptance criteria).
NAL. However, I'm currently pregnant in WA state and have been having routine bloodwork done. The first panel I had checked my levels and included a drug test for different drugs as well an std test. I was not told by my ob but at my next appointment I asked her. She said it's required by WA state and does not require consent.
