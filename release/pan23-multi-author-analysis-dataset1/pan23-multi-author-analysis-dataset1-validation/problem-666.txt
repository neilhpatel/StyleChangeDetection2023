A little off topic, but you may have insight here as well: The Basque claim their fisherman knew the waters of the New World way before these expeditions took place. Seeing as how eastern, coastal tribes survived European disease relatively better than their Western, inland counterparts, could there have been established contact and trade between the two continents way before officially financed expeditions?
Why did they keep going? In most cases it was the quest for riches. Huguenots weren't seeking wealth as much as freedom from oppression. Spain pushed north to block both France and England, or anyone else, from threatening their precious golden colonies to the south. They (Spainish explorers and conquistadors) also spent a ton of time walking around in North America from 1510 or so until 1560 or so looking for fabled golden cities based on native embellishment (to put it lightly) or previous expeditions massive exaggerations about the embellished stories of natives, who were being threatened or bribed to provide details on gold or silver rich cities. They weren't dumb and played the Spanish for whatever they could get by telling them what they wanted to hear. The French and English saw the ships full of gold and heard the rumors as well. That's part of why Roanoke is a mystery... Raleigh gave up financing colonization to search, literally, for El Dorado further south. It cost him 13 years in the Tower of London and got his head lopped off, too. And it cost Gov White his family. Other settlements formed and sent non-precious metals back, thinking they were all rich, only to be disappointed when word returned that those were just shiny rocks.
