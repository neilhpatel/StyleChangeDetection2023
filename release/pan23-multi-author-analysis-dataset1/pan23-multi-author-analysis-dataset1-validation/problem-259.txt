Unfortunately, there is no single answer to your question. Masters differed in their treatment of slaves both between different time periods and even during the same time period.
It does seem, at least from a general look at the material, that the treatment of slaves became marginally better over time. At least there became a few laws to protect them, and thought leaders of the day seemed to become more predisposed to treating their slaves with a modicum of decency.
I do tend to view this as a shift in the attitudes towards slaves, but again not necessarily because of human rights. The pervading attitude seemed to be that you got better work from slaves with more carrot than stick, so just killing a slave who is no longer well is a big fat stick and doesn't encourage a healthy slave to work well if he knows he'll just be killed if he gets sick.
Scroll down for the reading list. The programme itself always uses academics from the relevant field as guests and is well worth a listen.
Interesting question! My source, The Roman Guide to Slave Management, suggests that this was just the emperor's way of making the government's position on household management known since the issue had gotten a touch murky.
Yes, they do. They're allowed to have side income so long as it does not interfere with work. A common income source would be commissions when they run businesses or collect debt on behalf of their masters. It could be as simple as a baker's slave selling his master's loaves in another part of town away from the main shop.
