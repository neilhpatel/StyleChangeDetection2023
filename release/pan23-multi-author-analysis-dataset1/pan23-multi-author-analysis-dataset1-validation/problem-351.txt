> The Jewish diaspora (Hebrew: תְּפוּצָה, romanized: təfūṣā) or exile (Hebrew: גָּלוּת gālūṯ; Yiddish: golus)[N 1] is the dispersion of Israelites or Jews out of their ancient ancestral homeland (the Land of Israel) and their subsequent settlement in other parts of the globe.[3][4].
Ignore the circumstances that define the life of the average Palestinian, who is not a combatant with the political aims of supporting a militant groups that express actual anti-Semetic values. Ignore the fact that hundreds of villages have been torn down, destroyed, taken, and vacated in the name of expansion for settlers. Ignore the many videos that come out of there every year, much more in the recent 3 alone, that show indiscriminate violence, the build up of a far right movement that is emboldened by a right wing government, and crimes by the state of Israel that get overlooked after a news cycle (like blowing up an international news building and killing a famed journalist before raiding her funeral). Ignore it all if it helps you sleep at night.
Occupied People seldom behave rationally. Tossing propaganda to blame uninvolved parties is ineffective and stupid. Like in Ukraine, the Occupying force must remove themselves to have their claims of desire for peace taken seriously.
