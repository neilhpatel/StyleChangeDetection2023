However the straw that broke the camels back was a policy instated by Caetano regarding the training of troops and conscription rules. In 1973, in order to fill the never ending lack of Officers in the army, Caetano passed a law that allowed NCOs to fully become Commisioned Officers without training and essential become career officers in the army. Obviously, the Commissioned Officers that had been fighting in the war for over 10 years and had gone through proper training to become such, were very displeased about this law. We're talking about war veterans who were exhausted from the war and that were being forced to be part of huge american like operations that were failing one after the other. They protested against the law and the Government gave in, yet it was too late. The straw had already broken the camel's back. The Commissioned Officer circle had already turned against the government. The Movement of the Captains had already started.
I just listened to a lecture on the Bolshevik Revolution where the prof argued that Lenin's greatest strategic innovation/contribution to communism was "revolutionary infiltration" of the Imperial Russian Army and getting them to stage mutinies (which constituted much of the October Revolution). If the Portuguese Communist Party tried to do this to the Portuguese Army, why did the MFA not go all the way with supporting a communist revolution? Why weren't the communists able to take the initiative in consolidating power if they took the initiative in instigating a coup?
