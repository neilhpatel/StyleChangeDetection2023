Telehealh has been integral to allowing me to live a normal life and honestly it is way cheaper to see a doctor online than in person at least for what I go for. I get prescribed buprenorphine for the last 2 years online and they drug test me and everything else that an in person doctor would do. It's actually probably more thorough than in person. Around here it's like $300 every two weeks to see a doctor in person for that medicine. Whereas online it's $100 a month. It's a matter of affordability for me. Telling me to go in person is just going to make me jump through unnecessary financial obstacles for the same end result. Lucky this is just them asking the public for their thoughts for the next 30 days but I really don't think these things need to be shutdown completely.
Dose dependency. Opioids down regulate endorphins. Causing you to seek a higher dose for the same effect. The larger the dose the higher the likelihood it will depress breathing centers resulting in death.
