If you can have joint exercises with Russia, we can have joint exercises with India. Suck it up, China. Fuck the CCP. Whiny cunts.
Well I understand the US defensiveness considering when China was fighting the Korean war (when China insisted on postponing elections after a promised date, insisted on the illegitimate sygnman Rhee government who Sabre-rattled and probed the north), Chinese generals went to the papers asking for permission to nuke the US, and knowingly instigated a counterattack along the US border... oh wait that wasn't china????
Also funny how you call freedom of navigation exercises "increasingly hostile" when what they are doing is telling China it doesn't own the entire south China sea and that they do not get to bully their neighbors to accept their claims the one who is being overly hostile is China.
Honestly I wouldn't care at all. The Mexican military is outgunned by the average texan county and China can't supply any of the forces it stages in Mexico. Let them do that exercise if they want.
Every single reddit take on US-china relations is entirely divorced from any historical context and its incredibly embarrassing.
