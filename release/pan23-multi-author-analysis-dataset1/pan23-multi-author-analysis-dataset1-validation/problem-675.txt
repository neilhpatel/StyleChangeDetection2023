He does have the guts, because he has the grift. He and MTG can run together and collect upwards of $400 million from the half of the GQP that loves him. At the end there will be $175 million left, he splits it 90-10 with MTG. On Nov 10 he announces fraud (again) and collects another $400 million from the rabid base, spends a few hundred thousand on lawyers. Takes the rest (sorry MTG, no split for you) and bounces. Net haul is close to 1/2 a billion.
What amazes me about this report, and everyone commenting on it, is the apparent foregone conclusion - that apparently everyone has alluded to - that he will not only be a viable third party candidate, but also NOT barred from holding office AND not in prison.
100% bluff. He's hoping they'll see him taking half the GOP base with him and making sure they won't win any elections for the next decade. He won't do it, though, because he knows that he'll not only lose every election he and his candidates run for but it'll also come out of his own pocket. There isn't much money in small party.
