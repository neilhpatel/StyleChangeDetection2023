First of all, I would read the , especially the "General Information about Accommodations" section. Also, provide the school a link to which explicitly includes an option for exemption from statewide assessments. Then I would talk to your pediatrician specifically with the guide and statute in hand.
SPED teacher, NAL, different state BUT I can’t imagine there isn’t an alternate assessment available (although really look into this & ask questions because our alternate assessment is much longer and involved than the regular state standardized test taken in 3rd grade and I would honestly rather my students take the regular state test w/accommodations than the alternate assessment if the score/results don’t really end up indicating anything useful either way because, hello, individualized education, anyone?!).
You might want to look into Parent Training Centers ( for a list of them) which help parents of kids with disabilities find resources but are, in my opinion, woefully unknown about, and can likely answer Florida-specific questions. If you need a lawyer, contact your state bar and ask about education lawyers, particularly focused on special education, or go to one of the advocacy groups in your area.
