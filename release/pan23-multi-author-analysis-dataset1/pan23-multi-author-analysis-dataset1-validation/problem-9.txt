Germany and the Ottoman Empire finalized their alliance on August 2, 1914, and the Ottoman Empire (militarily) entered WW1 on October 29, 1914, by bombing Russian targets in the Black Sea.
The closest the German and Ottoman Empire came to declaring a pan-Abrahamic alliance was the Ottoman Empire’s declaration of Jihad against the British, French, and Russian Empires. This document, prepared in the form of 5 legal opinions, signed by 29 religious authorities, and blessed by the Sultan himself was presented to the Ottoman elite on November 11th and then, during a pro-war rally, was read aloud on Saturday, November 15th, 1914 in Istanbul. Post-war scholarships largely focused on Germany’s role in the Ottoman Empire’s declaration of Jihad, but recent scholarship largely credits the Ottomans themselves for the declaration of Jihad, something that is supported the Ottoman’s often enthusiastic declaration of Jihad in other 19th century conflicts that Germany had nothing to do with.
I do see how that would be significant for the time, so I don’t mean to downplay it. Though that does seem distinct from what the question is asking.
German-Ottoman relations existed since the founding of the German Empire (the German Orient Society had regularly hosted Ottoman dignitaries since its founding in 1845), but picked up considerable steam at the onset of the 20th century. Realizing that a colonial conflict with Great Britain was almost inevitable, German Emperor Wilhelm II determined in 1905 that Germany ought not to enter into a war with Britain until it had formalized an alliance with the Ottoman Empire saying "we ought not to proceed until our alliance with Islam is perfected”.
This is all to say: while there’s never been a true unified pan-abrahamic alliance, the German Empire and Ottoman Empire certainly tried to create the perception of one during WW1.
An example: the Leipziger Neuesten Nachrichten, a Germany Daily in Leipzig wrote in late 1916,"There rises up before England's sunken eyes the spectre of the exaltation of all Islam", "a call from the Caliph, and it will be heard as far as Arabia, in Algiers, in Morocco, and the band of shared faith with unite them all.”, a direct reference to the Jihad declared by the Ottoman Empire.
Similarly, a brochure (“Die Wahrheit über den Glaubenskrieg”, The Truth about the War of Belief) authored by Salih ash-Sharif at-Tunisi, a religious scholar of North African origin, provides a religious casus belli for the Great War from both an Ottoman and German perspective. Highlighting WW1 as a war against unrighteous enemies, Salih ash-Sharif at-Tunisi argued that it was the personal duty of all Muslims to enter the fight against the Russian, French, and British colonizers. The German Society for Islamic Studies actively attempted to spread Salih ash-Sharif at-Tunisi’s work widely in both the Ottoman and German Empires.
As the war progressed (and not for the better), German and Ottoman war departments increasingly relied on religious propaganda to boost sagging war morale in their respective countries.
