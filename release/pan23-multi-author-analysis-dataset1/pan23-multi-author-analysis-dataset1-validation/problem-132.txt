Thank you. That is what I was thinking but I wanted confirmation. I am very dedicated, loyal and try to be upfront with everyone. I hate to keep things from people, but I guess I'm going to have to. My official title is "operations manager" but most of my job involves purchasing, logistics, inventory control/management and trend analysis in the pharmaceutical/sanitary/industrial industries. I've been here for over 7 years and I haven't been given any kind of pay increase or incentives. I just feel bad because if I get another position somewhere I am going to leave them in a bad spot because there isn't anyone else that really knows how to do my job. I'm going to give notice, but it will still put them in a pinch. I don't really have any ties to the area so I have been applying to positions all over the country.
That’s totally understandable, especially with the pandemic. Maybe this will be the impetus to find something better for you. The comment about your boss flipping out over someone giving their 2 weeks notice is also indicative of being manipulative. In business, it’s certainly reasonable for a person to try and get the best compensation for themselves. If your company values their employees and doesn’t want high turnover, maybe they should pay you more.
