Not sure. I suppose so. But that isn't what's happening. It would be dysfunctionality of epic proportions for the Republicans to give up the Speaker and/or committee leadership positions in the House. It is so very unlikely.
I think they mean minority Speaker as in a member of the minority party in the House as Speaker ... which technically could happen if a couple of moderate Republicans were fed up or they did the political calculations and decided a Democratic Speaker who can't control a House (as would be the case for a minority Speaker in general) would be better than a Speaker of their own party failing to handle the GOP House civil war.
As for the the rest. IMHO Oregon is a bit strange. It runs the ganbit from far left to far right. Democrats outside of Portland and Eugene really hated Brown, and through her Kotek. If they ran a more moderate for Governor and in the 5th it would have cleaned up and it wouldn't have been close at all. Johnson only ran, and was a spoiler because of the dislike most the state had for Brown. They weren't voting for Kotek no matter what.
