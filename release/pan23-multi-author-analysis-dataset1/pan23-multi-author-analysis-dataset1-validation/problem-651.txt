In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I don't know how we do this. Because a 5lb bag of fentanyl is a god awful amount per dose. So they can stop 99 out of 100 5lb bags and it really doesn't address the issue.

Additionally the pharmacies, especially the large chains completely failed to preform their corresponding responsibility and due any due diligence to ensure that those prescriptions were being dispensed appropriately.
Yup. The amount of people on reddit alone who call me a drug abuser is astounding. No, fuckass, I need the right amount of dopamine to be on a level playing field with people like you!
Ultimately, the efforts to categorize pain as a "vital sign" identified a fake "epidemic of undertreatment of pain", convince regulators of "pseudo-addiction (the idea that people showing signs of addiction are not addicted because the drug is prescribed by a doctor), identifying opioids as suitable for the long term treatment of chronic non-cancer pain and probably a host of additional lies and misstatements about opioids is the ultimate cause of the problem. Yea, it's true the response dealt with one aspect but not the excess demand and paved the way for abuse of illicit opioids including synthetics that include fentanyl, but those were efforts to curb and already out of control problem.
The vast majority of people who were taking prescription opioids were overprescribed and tons of those folks were diverting their prescriptions to others. The problem started with the blatant misrepresentation of the risks and benefits of the prescription drugs by the pharmaceutical industry.
