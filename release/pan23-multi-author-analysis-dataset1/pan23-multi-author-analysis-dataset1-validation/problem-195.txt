The first is that the means to deceiver supplies to the frontline were either inadequate or non-existent. In the context of the First World War, this was usually the case. As an attacking force advanced, usually across No Man’s Land which was pockmarked with shell holes, barbed wire and the detritus of war, it became harder to resupply them as supplies usually had to be carried by men following behind. This was slow and it was dangerous and it required a large number of men to carry enough supplies to keep the attacking force resupplied. This was one of the major obstacles that both sides faced during the war as they attempted to advance. As the war went on, the situation only somewhat improved with the development of narrow gauge light railways which could deliver large numbers of supplies to the rear areas but could not go into the front lines. Motor vehicles couldn’t traverse broken terrain and were restricted to the exisiting and surging road networks. They did experiment with supply tanks which proved to be somewhat successful and they also experimented with dropping ammunition from aircraft to advancing troops. The problem in the First World War was never truly solved though as communication with frontline forces was always an issue making locating a unit and determining what they needed was incredibly difficult.
But I digress. In comparison to that, in WWI you now needed entire trains worth of ammunition to be coming to the front EVERY DAY. In addition to food and other supplies. This was a major reason why breakthroughs were so hard to follow up on. It could take from days to months to stockpile enough surplus ammunition at the front to launch major offensives.
