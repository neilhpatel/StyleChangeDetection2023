In a modern definition of the word, Celtic generally means a speaker of an Indo-European language part of a group including some being still spoken such as Welsh or Irish, some that disappeared such as Celtiberic or Gaulish. How do we know Gaulish was a Celtic language? Essentially from ancient sources : Greek and Romans authors mentions the name of rulers, peoples, towns, etc. they met. These aren't the same ancient source at disposal, tough, as contrary to a common belief, Gauls did wrote their language down and only refrained themselves to use it for preserving "high cultural" productions (such as epics, songs, theology, etc.). Various scripts (Gallo-Etruscan in northern Italy; Gallo-Greek in southern Gaul; Gallo-Latin in Gaul) were used to write down dedications, mark of ownership, advertising, coins, funeral stones, calendars, curses, etc.
Wow thanks for such a detailed reply! Would you say then if Irish are Celts, by extension then all Irish are Gauls?
An unexpected conspiracy of ancient Greeks and early contemporary scholars is to blame for the seemingly irreconcilable contradiction. Ancient Greeks tended to label the corners of the world known to them as inhabited by Barbarians living on almost boundless regions : Keltoi were inhabiting the North-West from Mediterranean Sea to mythical lands the same way Scythians or Ethiopians did, and just as Ligures were supposed to be before the term Keltoi was preferred.When the antiquity of Irish and British history was carried over by the early romanticist, then modernist movements, it's the term "Celt" that was used to label populations that as far as we know, never considered themselves as such.
Thank you for the fantastic answer. Just a couple of adjacent questions if they are allowed. Did the Romans consider the ancient Britons/Celtiberians to be the same as the Celts or Gauls? Did the Ancient Britons/Celtiberians consider themselves to be same as the Celts/Gauls.
