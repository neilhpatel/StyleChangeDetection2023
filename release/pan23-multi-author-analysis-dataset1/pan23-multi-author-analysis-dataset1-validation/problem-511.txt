The first was the fact that it was initially reported among groups of people who were already subject to significant social stigma in the early 1980s (gay and bisexual men, IV drug users, and Haitian immigrants); this made it easy for the media and political/religious figures to single out AIDS patients for stigmatization. Of course, this was compounded by the fact that AIDS emerged right as the Reagan Revolution was occurring and the so-called Moral Majority was becoming a powerful force in American politics. In the early days of the epidemic, the media referred to AIDS as GRID (Gay-Related Immune Deficiency), "gay cancer", or the "gay plague", reinforcing the idea that this was a "gay disease", when, of course, it wasn't; it was just a sexually-transmitted disease that happened to affect the gay community first in the US. The later understanding that, in other parts of the world, AIDS was primarily a disease of heterosexual transmission, didn't really do much to change that perception, especially since the early dire warnings of the potential for a large-scale epidemic of heterosexually-transmitted AIDS didn't materialize in the US (and the most severe burden of heterosexually-transmitted AIDS also fell upon historically marginalized communities).
Thank you for this detailed answer. I was young during these events, but I do remember them well, Including the uninformed hysteria and discrimination even though reliable information was available.
