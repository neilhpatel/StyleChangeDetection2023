The thing is, we know only a few elements about Merovech as a founding figure of Merovingians, and most of it is mixed up with fantastic features such as a monstrous origin. When mentioned in Frankish history, it is always in relation to genealogies which are themselves probably disordered : Merovech as father of Childeric is only one of the available filiations even if it's the more plausible.
Thus this seemingly conflicting affirmation you're looking at : note that neither author is saying Merovech and Childeric fought on different sides, but attempting separately from each other to identify the "elder" and the "younger" son as respectively Childeric and Merovech.
All I can say to you is that specialists of Merovingians (EDIT : in French academia) rather tends to identify the "younger son" as either Merovech or Childeric if they have to both "take a side" or even identify Priscus' Franks as Salians, the alternative interpretation proposed by Bona being arguably a bit winding, while by no means proven wrong and not warranting to be dismissive about.
edit: nvm not gunna waste your time. imma try to research what i can about those two people and re-read your reply afterwards. its just so damn frustrating the impact these peoples had on western european history yet we know fuck all about their details! >. idk how people who study history cope with this frustration. clearly it isn't for impatient people like me.
We know there were Franks on both sides during the battle but at this point, Franks weren't a single people, but an ensemble of communities headed by different petty-kings.Besides Frankish communities settled in Gaul and directly under the imperial control, there were communities identified as "Salian Franks" and headed by the obscure early Merovingians as petty-kings; but also other communities known as a whole as "Rhenish Franks" with their own petty-kings. Both groups only got unified, forcefully, only in the early VIth century by Clovis.In addition to a succession conflict we can reliably associate with either Salian or Rhenish Franks, both groups were probably involved in the battle in their own way.
At this point, it should be pointed out that Salians were only one of the petty-kingdoms in obedience to Rome along with the Rhenish Frankish ensemble : there's nothing certain about Merovech being even involved there. Franks being somewhat of secondary interest in most of the first half of the Vth century as far Romans were concerned, details are lacking.
On the other hand, and again Frankish royal lists are made tardily and messily, Gregorius accounts Childeric being already king in the late 450's. Merovech would have been only king for some years? It could mean that Clodion was dead already by the 450's, succeeded by Merovech and that Childeric would be the adoptive son of Aetius, which would be fitting the reinforcement of the Roman-Frankish alliance under Childeric.
The latter accounted Clodion as the father of Merovech, so if Priscus' text is describing a succession crisis among Salians, Clodion still being active in 447/448 when Majorian defeated him means that he would have been the deceased king and Merovech involved as a possible son or heir and potentially the younger son thus described.
Arguably, for Christian Settipani, the disordered list of Salian kings might be explained by a struggle of succession from which Merovech and his lineage would have been partly ousted (as it might have happened for Childeric later on and forced him to exile).
