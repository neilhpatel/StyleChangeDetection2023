If anyone really wants AskHistorians to be good and fast rather than cheap and good, and has millions of dollars, have a think about starting a non-profit to provide salaries to mods/some flairs, so the subreddit has the time and resources to answer the questions (relatively) quickly.
The fact of the matter is it takes patience. It takes time for a good answer to be written. If you want a slap dash, half right answer there's lots of other places to go to. This is a community dedicated to a very specific type of question and answer, and we're getting it! Seriously, go check out the digest. It's filled with stuff. But while your looking check out the time stamps. I think the average is something like 5-8 hours for an answer to show up. When it does, its well worth the wait.
One thing that we have hard is that there's a setting in New Reddit that will hide threads once you've clicked on them, so you may want to check and see if that's enabled for you (sorry to be vague, we use Old Reddit as mods because New Reddit lacks most of the mod-tools we need). That may be a reason you're clicking on threads and not seeing that they've been answered later.
