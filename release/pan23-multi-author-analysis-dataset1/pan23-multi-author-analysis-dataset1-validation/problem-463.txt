You are willing to either accept and deposit the check that he has provided as required by law with his acknowledgement that you are declining to release him from future claims related to your tenancy, or you will return his check to him, and wait to receive a new one that is issued unconditionally, however, you are explicitly not waiving or expanding the deadlines specified by statute, and should his acknowledgment (in writing) that you are not releasing him from further claims by cashing the current check or a replacement check not arrive within the statutory period, you will seek all monies owed to you plus all statutorily allowable penalties for his failure to return your deposit in a timely fashion.
I’d return the check and ask him to issue it without the language. If he refuses, talk to your attorneys about a failure to return your deposit. They can’t condition your deposit return on a total release otherwise everyone would do it.
