I don't think you're listening to what we're saying. Either that, or you've not made something clear.
Okay we had a year lease ended 02/2021 he told us to stay another year and use our old lease as a new one like it would just pass over to another year since it was signed by all of us but upon looking at the laws after him trying to kick us out we’re legally on a month to month because we didn’t technically sign a new lease we used the old lease as a new one because that’s what he said to do. Apparently he has his daughter coming back from out of state and she needs to live somewhere so he’s kicking us out so she can move here. We haven’t broken any of the lease agreements and we also have not ever been late on rent or owe rent. I really want to just take him to court to see if the eviction won’t be on our record because this is fucking bullshit and he’s just being a slumlord. I can’t move to this side of town because there’s shootings literally everyday there and he’s charging us the same amount. I don’t want an eviction on my record but us moving to this house is dangerous and we’re facing homelessness because of this.
