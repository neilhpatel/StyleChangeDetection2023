Now, Manuela Saenz was not a proper lady in any sense of the word. Ah, Saenz... now that's a woman. Despite the fact that Saenz was also a privileged criolla brought up in high society, Saenz completely rejected the expectations that the age had for women. She seemed to delight in scandalizing polite society, going out of her way to defy societal norms and attack the old system. For example, she was married to an English gentleman yet made no effort to conceal her affair with Bolivar. She would spend time with him in Lima, while her husband was but a few houses away. El Libertador certainly had the right to have several mistresses, no one would reproach a man for that, but for a lady to cheat on her husband? Bring me my smeling salts!
Thank you very very much I already saved these books and authors, I'll look for them soon If you have some Spanish bibliography is even better for me If you can send it, it would be amazing, but only if you can, of course Thank you again for all the amazing information!
I don't think she was. First, the reason she flouted gender norms is because of her interest in politics and government. She was a staunch patriot that had campaigned for independence since the early days and remained politically involved. But politics was a man's sphere, and just by wanting to be involved in politics she was breaking a gender norm. It was the same in regards to the military, government, even her sexual life. She broke those rules not because she wanted to be a man, but because women were not allowed to do all these things she wanted to do. She was effectively stating that women should be allowed in that public sphere hitherto reserved to men.
So, there was a rule against breaching the expected gender roles, which was part of a wider series of norms that sought to dictate the proper behavior of women and men in polite society. For Saenz and the people around her, dressing as a man was more than merely impolite. It was a statement, a way to openly defy society and its norms, and thus unacceptable. People did not commonly dress up as the opposite gender because that would go against most societal norms. Saenz dressed as man because she wanted to defy those norms, and the ball was not the only occasion she did so, often parading around cities in an official's uniform. Knowing Saenz, if dressing as a man had been acceptable in any way, she wouldn't have done that as often because her goal was scandalizing people and breaking expectations.
