This is but one of these reports where they openly state that they are killing thousands and hundred thousands of Jews.
As for the public in the US and the UK, they too were aware if not of the fine details, that Germany was killing Jews in large numbers. The New York Times e.g. admitting to its own failure to report more prominently on the Holocaust. They wrote:
I'm sure some less than competent history teachers have said that the US fought in World War II to save Jews from the Holocaust, and it's very likely that some students might get this impression because of the generic way that the US's role in the world during the twentieth century is described, but I don't think it would be at all accurate to say that this is how this issue is generally presented in the US history curriculum.

The school curriculum in the US is very decentralized and individual teachers, schools, and school districts can have a certain amount of flexibility about what is taught and how, so this question can't be answered straightforwardly. But no state standards or textbooks that I've seen state or even imply that the United States entered the Second World War in order to save European Jews from genocide. The standard narrative presented to students in US history classes is that the US gradually abandoned its isolationist position as a result of increasing militarism and expansionism on the part of the Axis powers, culminating of course with Pearl Harbor. The Holocaust and Nazism in general tends to get covered in terms of a global "rise of totalitarianism" that also includes Stalinism, Italian fascism, and the Spanish Civil War, which happened while the United States was absent from international affairs. (The US's failure to accept Jewish refugees from Europe is often mentioned in this context.) The Second World War is the moment when the US once again took up its responsibilities as a world power, joining the fight against Nazi totalitarianism, and then ultimately leading the struggle against Soviet totalitarianism. I don't mean to suggest that teachers don't try to complicate or add to this obviously oversimplified and rosy narrative, or that textbooks and standards leave everything out that doesn't fit it. But these themes would make it fairly easy for a forgetful or inattentive student to end up with the idea that the US fought the war in order to liberate the concentration camps, if the teacher or textbook doesn't address this directly.
