I cant blame Ukraine for saying no. Fall/early winter is the best time to put down the Russian fertilizer so their lands are ready for the spring planting season with all the farmers new industrial Russian donated tractors.
Exactly. Fuck Putin and fuck Russians. Yes, fuck Russians sans maybe 10% of the legitimate anti Putinists. One thing I want people to understand, and I don’t have a dog in this fight, except human decency and righteousness, so obviously I want Ukraine to piss on Russia’s grave, but don’t fall for the propaganda that Russians are being kept in the dark on what’s really going on. No they’re not, this is the nation of chess players and survivors of corrupt political regimes since the bullshitvicks. They knew exactly what Putin is doing and they support him, even now. They had a test run with Crimea and thought the world wouldn’t care and Ukraine would just surrender at Russia’s cock waving. Unfortunately for mother Russia, there was a hole in the crotch and nothing hanging out. If Russia is struggling and now they’re feeling the pinch, then overthrow the cause of your pain. And while you’re at it, get rid of the kremlin. I dare you. You have enough smart people in the opposition party to have a standing government if you chose to get rid of Putin and his cronies. Only the Russian people can fix this from within, not America, not the cia, not nato. This really is a proxy world war 3. Ukraine has so much military aid, they can’t keep track; nations just take turns suppling Ukraine with all kinds of advanced military equipment and Ukraine has a standing army of a million fighters. So check mate Mother (Fucking) Russia, your move.
Additionally I feel that it would also be one of the worst possible moments for the West to try and withdraw support now when we're also effectively "balls deep" in the conflict even if not directly militarily involved - as it could effectively lead to us having to deal with a vengeful and furious Russia while they'd still be in a strategic position to make deals and demands after successfully holding key parts of Ukraine, an angry and betrayed Ukraine, and potentially a slew Eastern European countries feeling frustrated at how their "comrade" was again betrayed due to West being soft and weak.
1. He didn't crack down on political opponents. All the opposition parties are up and running. Medvedchuk was persecuted, but he is Putin's ally and relative who was fucking exchanged for the Ukrainian defenders during the prisoner swap. It is hilarious, but his party is still up and running in the parliament, majority of the deputies just renounced Russia and became pro-Ukrainian.
