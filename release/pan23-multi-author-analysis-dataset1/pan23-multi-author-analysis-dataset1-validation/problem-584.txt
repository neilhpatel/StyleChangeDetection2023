There are any number of ways Maclay might have encountered lamas in his readings, none of which he specifies. Nor is it entirely clear if he even necessarily understood what lamas were at any lenh. However, there are certainly quite plausible ways he might have heard of them. To make a bit of a disclaimer before we start, I found most of the examples below through ECCO, a service that specifically digitises British books of the eighteenth century. However, as these serve not as a precise chronology but rather as an illustrative sampling, and because there would have been some transmission of books across the Atlantic, this should not be too problematic for the purposes of this answer.

About 50,000 Kalmyks were mobilized by the Soviets during the Second World War, with formations of them serving at Brest in 1941, and the 110th Kalmyk Cavalry Division fighting in the Don area in 1942 during the German summer offensive (which occupied most of Kalmykia on the way to Stalingrad). The first Soviet general to reach the German border in 1944 was actually a Kalmyk lieutenant general, Basan Gorodovikov - he received the Hero of the Soviet Union award for this, as did 21 other Kalmyks during the war. Despite this service, because of the German occupation and recruitment of a number of Kalmyks for Wehrmacht service, the entire population of Kalmykia was deported (in basically a genocide) in December 1943, and exiles had to wait until the 1950s to start returning to their traditional homes.
Great details! Would you happen to have any additional readings on the deportations? I'm digging around catalogues and libraries and there's not much English materials to work with, specific to the Kalmyks. Also, do you know of any good primary sources related to Kalmyks that's been translated to English? That too is pretty lacking.
Adam Ferguson’s 1767 ‘Essay on the History of Civil Society’ invokes the lamas as a form of primitive clerical headship congruous with the druids of Iron Age Europe, but with the difference being that the druids were sources of rudimentary civil government while the Lamas began the introduction of despotism – what distinguishes these, he does not make clear in the immediate context:
The long and short is: yes. The region wasn't heavily populated, but it did have inhabitants (largely pastoral Nogai and Kazakhs), who were displaced by the Kalmyk invasion and settlement. The Kalmyks also had a very complicated and often violent relationship with Russian border settlements.
