It's only entrapment if the agent was coercing you...if they threatened you or implied consequences in the event that you didn't go along with the planned illegal activity. A honeypot isn't entrapment if they're saying they'll give you something you want in exchange for doing something illegal. You're making a choice there, which provides intent. It would be entrapment if it were a more conventional honey trap...if they banged you, then said they would make the sex publicly known in a situation where that would impact you negatively, thus coercing you to go along with something you wouldn't participate in if they didn't have leverage against you.
