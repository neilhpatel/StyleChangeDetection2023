In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. Iâ€™m older, but went back to school for my degree at the age of 35. Had two kids while there. Loans were the only way we could afford it with daycare etc. Been paying off solidly since - even while the loans were put on hold during the pandemic. Managed to get them down to almost $10K. The idea of being free of them is magical.
Hilarious. You can be sent to war, but you can't participate in the democracy you're expected to defend and die for. How can people vote for these clowns?
Conservativism is proof American Evangelicals have actually abandoned the teachings of Jesus. The parable of the wicked servant applies to these people.
