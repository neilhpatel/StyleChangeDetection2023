Nah, lithium is not a desirable chemistry for stationary energy storage. Sodium and flow batteries can be made at even lower prices and don't require any scarce resources but they're not necessarily ideal for transportation. For storing solar energy in fixed locations, though, they make great sense and can certainly beat lithium on price once they are manufactured at a large scale.
At this moment in time, in this snapshot of the transition to renewables that is 2023, lithium based batteries are certainly your best bet. LiFePO4 is a much better choice than lead-acid for the time being and they will be cheaper in the near future. I'm sure that's true. But it's also true that even lower cost alternatives that don't use lithium at all will also be available in the next few years and this is what I was emphasizing.
Good example of the fact that lithium is traditionally so plentiful that it isn't even counted as a commodity. The Potash Corporation of Nevada/Utah was originally called the Lithium Corporation but they bailed on lithium because it was worth less than dirt. Potassium is worth slightly more than dirt at the wholesale level.

I'm not saying there is something wrong with doing so at this time. What I'm saying is that going forward, in the near future, you will find that this will not be the key market for lithium chemistry batteries because there will be less costly and more effective alternatives which are already being manufactured.
These refer to up and coming battery chemistries which are specifically targeted to the energy storage market. The reason they're better is that they will be lower in cost and not contain any rare materials which will make them free of controversy for the same reason that they will be low in cost. This is the original reference. It is not to say that you cannot or should not use a lithium ion battery pack to store solar energy at time time. Even lead-acid is fine at this point in time. Soon that won't make much sense but for now whatever it takes is good enough. The same will soon be true for using lithium batteries for storing energy for stationary uses. You could still do so, but it won't make sense.
India is an expansionist power says Pakistan (started 4 wars against India and lost all) and China (started 1 war against India which India lost, and has had multiple encroachments into Indian Territory in recent years). Lol.
I was looking up the typical chemical compositions of natural mineral springs and noticed that lithium bicarbonate and lithium chloride are both one of the most common minerals you will get from a naturally occurring mineral springs. So it's interesting to pair that with all the media information about increasing interest in geothermal. Newer drilling technologies are also part of this. If you pair that with the known fact that 1,600X as much lithium as exists in the oceans compared to what is found on land precisely because lithium salts are water soluble, it makes the idea of solution mining all the more attractive. Instead of the diluted ocean brine, why not try highly saline underground brine which is already concentrated to the point of super saturation and by the way use the hot steam to spin a turbine for a little side cash.
