For me, the difference between a "history buff" and a "historian" is: _do you generate new research questions and answer them to the level of rigor that would be accepted by other historians?_ If the answer is "yes," then great, you're a historian, congrats. If the answer is something more like, "well, maybe I _could_, but I've never tried," then you're still in buff-land, but you could imagine transitioning, though it might take more work than you imagine (it is far harder to generate novel research questions than most people realize; it is really the hardest part of the job, aside from, you know, getting said job). And if the answer is, "but I have encyclopedic knowledge," that's great But that's not the same thing that a historian is. That's still in the territory of the "history buff.".
Just piggy backing on what the other poster said, I donâ€™t think you could get a degree in Peanuts, but I very much think you could get a graduate degree in journalism (usually called mass communication at the graduate level), communication or history and focus your dissertation or thesis on comics.
Happy to help. I just saw in your other post that you are 17, so instead of the graduate programs list that I posted you might want to look into these .
