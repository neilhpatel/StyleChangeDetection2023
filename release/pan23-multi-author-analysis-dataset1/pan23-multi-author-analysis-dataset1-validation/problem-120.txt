I’m a lawyer but I do not practice in Texas so this isn’t legal advice. This does sound like sexual harassment to me and retaliation. You should find an employment discrimination lawyer to rep you. If you want to seek a settlement without a suit and terms of resignation, you should be represented. Normally a lawyer will take a case like this without you paying fees up front and will take a contingency fee (their payment is contingent on settling or winning at trial and they take part of the money won). If you resign voluntarily, you will likely have no leverage for a settlement. If you have any documentation or evidence surrounding the complaint and issues (emails, texts, forms, audio recordings) save them as soon as possible. Anticipate that at some point you will not have access to a work email, laptop or phone.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Look up the one for your state, you will likely be able to file online. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against you for filing (although they do get away with it at times).
