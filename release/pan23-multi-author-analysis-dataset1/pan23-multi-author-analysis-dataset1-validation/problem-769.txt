The most famous disaster to transform the face of Rome was of course the great fire of 64 (the one Nero "fiddled" through), which devastated 10 of Rome's 14 districts (Tac., Ann. 15.40). This, however, was only one of many conflagrations. Another devastated much of central Rome in the reign of Domitian, and yet another shortly before the reign of Diocletian - and these are only the ones our sources see fit to mention. As a result of these fires (and the earthquakes and floods to which Rome was so lamentably prone), virtually every public building standing in 133 BC had to be rebuilt at least once over the course of the imperial era.
In the half-millennium between 133 BC and AD 400, the center of Rome was transformed (speaking very generally) by three factors: a series of disasters, the rise of unimaginably wealthy patrons, and (at the end of the period) the advent of a new religion. To take these in turn...
A further analogy: was it more like Paris (where the entire city was rebuilt in a new style after disaster/increased wealth), or like London (where a range of styles and materials from different architectural periods sit side by side on the same streets)?
