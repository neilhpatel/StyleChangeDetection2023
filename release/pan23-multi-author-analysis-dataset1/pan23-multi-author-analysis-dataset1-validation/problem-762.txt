Good points but everyone has a price. Trump’s price may be $3.1B and a 300 foot gold painted statue of himself with huge hands. They’ll run the numbers.

At its core, Trump and the MAGA movement are an anti-American, anti-Constitutionalist terrorist ideology. They’re willing to use violence and extremism as means to their end, and end of which is to turn the US into a UAE/Qatari-style system, where laws are based in a strict religious interpretation, society is strictly divided by race/ethnicity, and in exchange, the elites can do what they want. Trump, his MAGA movement, and their base are fascists.
Absolutely right. There’s no desire in the white nationalist movement to compromise or try to coexist with the rest of us. No amount of appeasement will stop them from attempting complete domination.
