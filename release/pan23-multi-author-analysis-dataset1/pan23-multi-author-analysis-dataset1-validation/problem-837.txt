Construction could also be seen as a fairly practical and workmanlike profession, with elaborate designs often entrusted to individuals with the time to devise them and the money to construct them. A person with sufficient time and means could be expected to plan their own home, directing the work as they saw fit; and it would be up to the workmen to ensure the load born by the walls and beams wasn’t too much, while the sculptors and carvers were to ensure their decorations wouldn’t topple over. Master stonemasons certainly brought their own ideas to the table (in fact, skilled stonemasons were often in high demand, and could even be part of an aristocratic dowry) but people with more money than sense could also insist on taking things in the wrong direction; it’s not unheard of to hear of precarious add-ons like towers or turrets collapsing, and fire was a constant threat that often went unmitigated (not that people didn't know how to make fireplaces, but things weren't up to modern fire code standards either). In spite of this, there are many beautiful buildings from the 14th century still standing today, and skilled and experienced masons as well as self-trained architects were certainly numerous enough such that we can’t say people were totally winging it all the time. The planning of public buildings, like town halls or tribunals (some of which still stand today) could even be entrusted to important members of the community who might not have any architectural experience at all, but were the most trusted to oversee the work of stonemasons and sculptures, often ensuring that different guilds (whose taxes were often paying for the structure, and whose artisans were constructing it) were in agreement as to how the work was to go forward. Architectural competence could even be an outright expectation for some members of the community: in the 12th and 13th century Italian city of Milan, dynasties of the local aristocracy were expected to oversee the construction and maintenance public structures like gate houses and toll booths.
More in the sens of black labour or moonlighting. The guilds worked as monopol, that meant that no other than guildmembers could workd (closing down buisness with excutive force i.e. having communal government persecute non-members or simple violence against them, social ousting). This monopol of course works the other way around, as for clients there is only one price. There existed always people which wanted circumvent that monopol employe such workers if there price was cheaper. This however was always illegal and could lead punishment or some violence.
