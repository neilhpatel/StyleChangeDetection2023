I would argue that depending on the age of the student, were they able to tell someone where all their injuries are? I would want to know what tests to ask for at the doctor to determine the extent of the injuries. Do i need to ask for xrays or other internal imaging? Is it just a wait and see type of thing?

The school is probably right. If they handed you the video, and you went out and took revenge, the school could be liable. You have legal ways of getting the video, though.
First, let them know that they need to preserve the footage because of pending legal action. Do it by email, and then also send a certified letter. Keep a copy of the letter, and the receipt with their signature. This should prevent them from erasing the video, or allowing it to be erased. Yes, they should do that anyway, but you want proof that you told them.
