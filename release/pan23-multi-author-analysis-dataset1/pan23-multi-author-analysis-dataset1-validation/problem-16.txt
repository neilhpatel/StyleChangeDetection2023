I just didnt quite get how to understand who "colored" people were then. So did it basically mean anyone who is not "african black" , but not "european white" either? Were they Africans or not? Or mixed?
The key thing is that Coloured identity was seen as an adjunct of the older colonial past very clearly, and have a closer relationship with that past than do the more eastward [not westward] African kingdoms and chiefdoms (grouped successively during apartheid under 'Native,' 'Bantu,' and finally 'Black') with other defined group identities (such as the supra-identity of amaZulu) despite their own colonial connections in forming identity (Mahoney's The Other Zulu is good on this). Thus, 'Coloured' (always with a u, and should be capitalized) can include a wide variety of subgroupings (Griqua, Cape Malay, etc) that people may or may not embrace. Adhikari's title on his book about Coloured writers, Not White Enough, Not Black Enough, is perhaps by itself kind of instructive about the struggles around the identity. There's a fluidity and vibrancy to discussions of what it is historically and in the present that is hard to convey.
