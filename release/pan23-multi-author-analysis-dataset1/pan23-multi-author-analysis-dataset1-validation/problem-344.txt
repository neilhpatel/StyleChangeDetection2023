Tourism is very lucrative of course, but that's not what I meant though I probably didn't explain properly. What I meant is that inhabitants of Amsterdam such as myself don't see any of the money being brought in by tourists. The main effect these people have is driving up prices for basically anything from housing to groceries in the city, and the money they do spend disappears in the pockets of a few rich multinational corporations. While there's shockingly little insight into where exactly all this tourism money goes, it's an undisputed fact that housing has become ridiculously expensive in great part due to tourism (AirBnB for example).
Uhh…Yea dude. This is exactly the consensus. The only one who is gonna lose is the country that’s currently raking in the tourist bucks. People will just go somewhere else. If they don’t want tourists then they are making the right move. We are talking about a “Red Light District”. Have you ever been there? I have and smelling weed on the street is hardly the most offensive part if you’re looking at it though a prudish lense.
Really? Bong for me was the least impactful option time and time again. I bought one once, but used it maybe a dozen of times, and then went back to rolling.
