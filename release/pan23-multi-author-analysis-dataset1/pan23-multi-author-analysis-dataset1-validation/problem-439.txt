In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
John Oliver did a great piece about this. Basically, people hire Ticketmaster to be the bad guy so they can squeeze more money out of concerts. They ARE of course the bad guy but they also take the fall for the artists that get extra payments from their shitty practices.

Ticketmaster and Live Nation dominate the live entertainment supply chain with powerful positions in primary ticketing, secondary ticketing, concert promotion, artist management, tour sponsorships, and event venue operation.
What a crock of shit. The merger should never have happened. There IS a stranglehold on live entertainment with the Live Ticket Nation holding the noose. If a band doesn’t cow to their rules, regardless of popularity, most are forced to play substandard venues. Add to this, the hidden “convenience” fees et al., and you have a monolith that acts as a cultural fascist.
