In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Uh it was though? They were found on Nov 2, handed over to NARA on Nov 3 by the letter of the law (who is the appropriate body to handle them, not the DoJ), NARA informed the DoJ on Nov 4 as they're supposed to. They didn't choose to tell the press until later, but there's literally no evidence Biden's lawyer went through them, and they informed the appropriate body as soon as they possibly could. Nothing ridiculous about it.

You understand incorrectly. That only applies to higher level classifications like the TS/SCI docs trump had. Classified includes 3 levels, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret, SCI is a further designation that basically restricts parts of the full document, so no one ever has the complete information. SCIFs are required for TS/SCI documents and may be used for lower levels, but it's not a requirement.
