I'm going to illustrate this using the example of Los Angeles, because it's what I know best. (I'm currently writing a book on the subject.).
GM/National City Lines/American City Lines/Pacific City Lines never had any involvement whatsoever with the Pacific Electric. Pacific City Lines did own Los Angeles Railways from 1944 to 1958, when public ownership took over.
Fascinating. I see you have a map of the proposed Bart routes from the 1950s. I've heard it claimed (and repeated the claim myself) that the reason the Bart didn't get extended down the peninsula as planned was due to opposition from wealthy people in Atherton, who didn't want "hood rats from oakland" to be able to take a single train to their neoghborhood, leading to them backing the Caltrain as a less convenient alternative proposal. Is there any truth to that claim?
Finally, there's the technological question. One-car streetcars running in mixed traffic are technologically inferior to diesel buses, because they can't be rerouted for construction, and if something blocks the tracks, there's not much the streetcar driver can do except wait. In the Pacific Electric's case, many of their routes ran down busy thoroughfares, and they didn't have dedicated lanes the way that the modern L.A. Metro's trains do. And buses are cheaper to run per-passenger on low-capacity routes - there's no overhead wires or tracks to maintain. Trains really shine when they have dedicated right-of-way (i.e., their own dedicated lanes or tracks), and it's a high capacity route - a three-car train of streetcars, like the modern Expo Line, can handle 600 passengers per train with a single driver, which is equivalent to five buses. But one-car trains of streetcars running in mixed traffic have both the disadvantages of a train (can't detour) and the disadvantages of a bus (limited capacity).
