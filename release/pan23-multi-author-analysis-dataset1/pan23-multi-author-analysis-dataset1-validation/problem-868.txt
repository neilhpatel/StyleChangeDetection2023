"For the health and safety of our employees and patrons, all individuals entering the shop or participating in any games/tournaments must wear a mask that covers their mouth and nose. If for any reason you are unable to comply with this request, you may call ahead to place orders for curbside delivery, or view recorded games on our YouTube channel.".
ADA regs only require that businesses provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with medical issues. When I was working in a restaurant at the beginning of Covid the ADA released a statement that the owners printed out and posted for everyone to see. The statement summarized was basically this: the ADA does not recognize any situation where it is discrimination to bar a patron from entering the store for not wearing a mask as long as some accommodation can be offered outside the store, such as curbside service, delivery, a drive thru, or online ordering. Legally you are covered as long as you still provide some kind of accommodations.
