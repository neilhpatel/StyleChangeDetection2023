Hi there anyone interested in recommending things to OP While you might have a title to share, this is still a thread on /r/AskHistorians, and we still want the replies here to be to an /r/AskHistorians standard - presumably OP would have asked at /r/history or /r/askreddit if they wanted non-specialist opinion. So give us some indication why the thing you're recommending is valuable, trustworthy, or applicable Posts that provide no context for why you're recommending a particular podcast/book/novel/documentary/etc, and which aren't backed up by a historian-level knowledge on the accuracy and stance of the piece, will be removed.
2. Secondary sources are a good sign; that said, check them out Do some Googling, and look for things like how long ago they were published, who the author is, and what press they came off of I have had someone try to "cite" something they found in a self-published book by someone with extremely fringe views. Just because something is nominally "published" doesn't mean it's accurate. The gold standard here are going to be academic presses (i.e. Oxford University Press).
3. New Books Network- This is a podcast series in interview format. An academic interviews another academic about a new book they have published. Many topics but one is history and if I remember correctly the network was started by a historian. It should be available wherever you get you podcasts.
