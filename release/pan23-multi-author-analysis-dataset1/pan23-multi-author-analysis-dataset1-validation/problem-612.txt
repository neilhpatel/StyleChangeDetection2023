> Republicans, once slow to recognize the explosive growth and potential political influence of the Latino population—60 million nationwide, the country’s largest minority—are pouring money and deploying their staffs to conduct outreach and gain their vote. They’ve had mixed results in Texas but success in Florida, where Latino-backed Republicans scored victories in the midterms, most surprising in Miami-Dade, a lonime Democratic stronghold.
Heck, in Florida's case, one major city leans Republican - a significant portion of the city of Miami (the 26th-28th districts) elected Republicans to Congress, and Miami has had Republican mayors continuously since 2009!
Axis of Evil. With the 5th and 11th Circuits nearly as corrupt as SCOTUS, both states will be the models for cruelty and malfeasance in all other Red States.
