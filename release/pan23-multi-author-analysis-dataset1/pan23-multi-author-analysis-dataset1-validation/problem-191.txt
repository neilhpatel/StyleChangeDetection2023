Your fiance's sister cannot live without you without her parents consent, a court order or CPS intervention. Emancipation isn't an option unless she's financially independent.
Thank you for this I thought of her calling but never us calling. Not sure why I didn’t think of that. It’s a great option thank you. I have to admit I was hoping she could come here with us in NY for a bit as well because she lives in rural Indiana which is incredibly homophobic. We live in a big city in NY with many friends of all types, genders and sexual orientations. It would be a great place for her to build self-confidence and start to heal from trauma and love herself again. I got a lot of downvotes in this whole chain but I’m not trying to do anything nefarious here, I just want a legal way to help her. She’s a great kid. Thank you for the advice.
Thanks, this is the kind of advice I was looking for. I’ve never dealt with anything like this before and just want to do the best thing. We may just have to pursue emancipation and see how it works out.
