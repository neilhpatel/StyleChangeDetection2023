Also, remember that they're getting about 180 Leo 1s from Germany as well. No match for the Leo 2s being sent (2A4s and up), but still more than good enough against Russia.
Exactly, and from what I've read, the troops training in Germany (and I assume those in Poland as well) don't just learn how to operate the Leopard 2, they learn combined arms warfare, working together with artillery, reconaissance units (equipped with AMX-10, Dingo IMV and Bushmasters), pioneers equipped with vehicle launched bridges as well as medium mobile bridges systems that have been supplied with trained crews over the last few months by Germany and others, air support (where available) and rocket artillery (HIMARS, M270) which can to some extent fill in for any lack in close air support.
Don't forget Ukraine is huge. 31 or 62 tanks is still just a drop of the water in the ocean. They've lost what, 300, 500? Need more than that to go into offensive. I am hoping for Bradleys and other IFVs to preserve more lives and make their hit and run attack easier.
