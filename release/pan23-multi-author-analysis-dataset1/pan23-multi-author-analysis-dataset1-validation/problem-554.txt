I mean I really don't have much of a choice. I drove a 2007 Mustang convertible in 2012, I felt like origami getting in and out of it. I slept in the fetal position from 2009 to 2015 during my military service. I've bumped my head and hit my knee and everything in between. I hear vertically challenged people constantly complain about not being able to buy pants because they're too long. Reverse that issue, I can't find new pants because they're always all too short. Short people can have fabric taken from the pants with alterations, I can't have fabric added to pants with alterations.
Finally. As someone who flys every week for work, this should be the norm. Other passengers shouldn’t be made to suffer cause your fatass won’t fit in a seat.
As a 6'5", so-broke-I-can't-pay-attention-so-I-fly-economy-everywhere-I-go man this is just a fact. The limits of economy air travel is not limited to width, but lenh as well.
Seriously. If being called a fattie mcfatterson made them lose weight, don’t you think that would have worked by now?

And she gets obsessive about how much she eats and how inactive she is when she goes up or down, which, proportionately, is roughly 2x my weight gain/loss.
We. Want to believe that you know better than to present experience as scientific fact, shame others, and demand people adhere to your way of thinking.
