The situations your lawyer talked about are the common situations where a trust makes sense, but they're not necessarily the only situations. (The $11M thing relates to avoiding taxes, so that's a bit different.).
Personally, I don't agree that trusts are somehow only appropriate for people with over 11m in assets (which I am guessing that number is roughly based on the current lifetime exemption aka estate tax limits?) Nor do I agree they only have value for a complex estate with real estate, business, and potential family issues. But there are some reasons to not have a trust, including the added cost in tax preparation and legal costs associated with preparing, modifying, and terminating them... it's a complex affair, and not for everyone, but generally there's no broad qualifier of who should and should not have a trust of some sort established - that's up to you after being properly advised by your attorney, financial advisor, estate planners, family, and any other trusted advisors you might have.
