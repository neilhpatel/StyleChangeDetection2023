I’ve never had a dispute not resolve in my favor. As long as you tell them you did not authorize the charges you are golden. They cannot run your card on file simply whenever they want. They don’t make the rules. This is easy.
You can dispute with your bank but you still have to provide documentation if you have proof you canceled and you have the contract that shoes you canceled the way it says so in the contract then you can win and a charge back can be captured if not then you should go the small claims court but one thing that I can't tell ppl on a recorded line... Depending on how big the business is a negative review on say a FB page or yelp or Google might do alot of good in this situation... The smaller the better cause they need that to promote themselves as a good company and the best gym in the area... So possibly go that route as well and it might help but if you don't have documentation then small claims court might be your only option and I'm not sure how the review would be seen in small claims court.
