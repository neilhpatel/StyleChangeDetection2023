I'm not even particularly sure Glubb is "pop history" - I think The Fate of Empires is a mostly-forgotten work that has achieved some strange afterlife mostly by being available online and being something that kind of speaks to people's current interests/anxieties.
1. Is it the elite that changes for the worse, or the challenges that become qualitatively different or more severe?
Finally the Assyrian Empire. He's actually talking about the Neo-Assyrian Empire (and so leaving out the Old Assyrian Empire that lasted 500 or so years and the Middle Assyrian Empire that lasted some 300 years), but he's also kind of arbitrarily starting the Neo-Assyrian Empire, much like with the Romanovs, with the assumption of the boy king Adad-nihari III, so neither when the Empire is properly considered to have started (a century earlier), nor when the boy king actually began ruling as an adult.
Does this also work in reverse? Have Chinese historians ever attempted to apply the chao concept to the history of traditional "Western" states like (to keep things at least somewhat relevant to the current topic) the Roman Empire?
With that said, no. This isn't a rule, and it's not something taken seriously by historians. Glubb's dates that he uses are exceedingly arbitrary and chosen specifically to produce this "rule". An older by u/XenophontheAthenian goes into how his division of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire into two separate "empires" is not only nonsensical, but the dates he uses are incredibly arbitrary.
3. Is there any difference between a "corrupt" and "competent" elite, aside from if their preferences are the right policy for the time?
