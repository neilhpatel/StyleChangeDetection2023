As far as I am aware, there is no consensus over who really are these "trogodytes", because the term has been used to refer to several different groups for whom the only common denominator was that "they supposedly lived in caves". Living in caves was a... common occurance, especially in the Sahara and Arabia(to the point where "Africa" is considered by some to have come from the berber word "Ifri"', which means "cave"). I personally believe Plutarch was reffering to some sort of Red Sea Coast dwelling peoples, given it would make sense for Cleopatra to understand the language of a people living close to her realm and on important trade routes.
That does indeed fit the Red Sea Coast dwelling and relevant to Egyptian Kingdom's characteristics of the "Troglodytes", and is, in my opinion, the most likely. However, since the term Troglodyte is looselly defined and applied to different people by Greek and Roman writers, it's hard to come to a definite conclusion over who they really were.
Not necesarilly like "Barbarian", because it wasn't used on a general scale, but in a more defined(but still vague) manner, and reffering to some sorts of people that shared (or the greeks perceived them as sharing!) this sort of cultural habit. Keep in mind living in a cave isn't some sort of neanderthal or primitive habit, that is a perception appeared in modernity, taking refuge in a cave with cool temperatures is the logical choice when you are in the desert.
Thank you! That all makes sense. Cleopatra is one of those ceaselessly interesting people to read about and her understanding the languages of local trading partners does make absolute sense given her tendency towards diplomacy and interest in her role as ruler as a profession, as it were.
