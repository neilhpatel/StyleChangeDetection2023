While some may say to contact your local government agency the problem is there is no one agency that oversees native sites. You do have federal laws that protect native sites NAGPRA.
Archaeologist here. For your first question about people being ousted from their ancestor's land-- I'm guessing you mean by the government, were authorities to realize it's an archaeological site? It's very unlikely. Is the land private land? If so, generally the law is that no one is going to be able to oust people from it just because it has an archaeological site on it. In the United States, unlike most other places, private landowners can do what they want on their own land, including destroy archaeological sites. NAGPRA, the main legal statute regarding the removal of Native American cultural artifacts, doesn't really prevent private landowners from doing what they want, except it does come into effect if people try to sell the objects taken. There may be certain exceptions, like if the land is physically within a reservation, or other things that I am unaware of. What I would do is look up the state and local laws.
