In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Texas, of course. A stupid, low-life, gun toting, brain rotting red state that somehow thinks they have any power at all over the remainder of the country. This is an obscene waste of resources, an incredible waste of taxpayer money for a judge to NOT know what his jurisdiction is. Stupid on steroids.
It’s easy to be critical of a single judge in some distant district of the country whose ruling has a national effect that we disagree with, and say “Why should we respect that ruling [on student loan forgiveness/on immigration/on whatever]?”.

Federal judges have jurisdiction over the federal judiciary. They have national effect when they rule. Sessions doesn’t care about that. Hawaii being an island is meaningless. And florida is a peninsula. And alaska is some random thing. And they all follow federal law.
