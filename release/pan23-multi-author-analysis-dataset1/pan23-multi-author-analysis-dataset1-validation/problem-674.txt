Besides that, there's a fair amount of work on the contexts of Judean and Galilean laborers in the first century in general, but the only other thing we have to go on for Jesus himself is the use of "Messiah/Christ" as a title. I'm trying to think of a modern analogue to the political statement that title makes in the first century, and I'm coming up short. Maybe it's like walking into the British House of Lords and declaring yourself King Arthur, except that in this analogy England lost the Cold War primarily by attrition and political maneuvers and is on the brink of civil war. Josephus and the book of Acts tell us about several different claimants to the messianic title, all of whom led or attempted to lead revolts against Roman power. Some scholars try to distance Jesus from that, but it's really difficult to escape if you put aside Christian theology in favor of the historical context. The fact that Jesus is supposed to have been crucified, a highly public and humiliating death often used for rebels, bears this out. The fact that his followers were apparently not executed along with him suggests that he wasn't actively planning violent action (yet??), or at least that Peter et al. knew how to go to ground for a few years.
I don't think you can say this with confidence, as it's quite easy to imagine reasons why he would make some of these things up- his narrative of being chosen to be a disciple very much set Paul apart from his ordinary, dull life as a poor tradesman, and gave him status as one of the innermost confidants of God.
That's it. People who study the historical Jesus try to fill in more, and there are some good guesses we can make by applying knowledge of first century economics, sociology, etc., to the early traditions, but since there's no real consensus on which parts, if any, of the Gospels are historical, the field of historical Jesus studies as a whole tends to have pretty wide-ranging disagreements.
That was my point. Being a marginal religious sect among many, Christianity and its sources couldn't have been a major interest to Josephus especially to write history. So, if Josephus had had any interest in Christian writings, I would imagine that he could have written about it, if only to debunk it from his perspective.
There isn't any reason to believe that Josephus is dependent on Christian writings here. It's a short reference to a marginal person related to a marginal person. If Josephus had been familiar with Christian sources, he would've written extensively about it. Josephus is almost silent on it. It would be odd for Josephus to look through the writings of a heretical sect just to single out the piece of information about James being the brother of Jesus, a minor detail both in Christian writings and Antiquities.
That works, though. There is absolutely no tradition that I'm aware of that Jesus wrote anything (barring John 8:1-11, which was almost certainly a later interpolation). Paul definitely would have been all over that if he'd had it, and he never even suggests it. Also, ancient Mediterranean cultures were primarily oral. Memorization of things like Torah and Homer were expected in a way that we, a primarily written culture, can't imagine. Jesus giving oral teachings that don't get written down for a decade or more after his death is a completely normal circumstance in that culture. You get a little and sometimes a lot of distortion and additions, but let's not pretend we don't get that in written cultures.
