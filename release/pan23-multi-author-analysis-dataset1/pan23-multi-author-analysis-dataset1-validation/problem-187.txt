Yes, using the Latin and Cyrillic alphabet. However, I'm not sure if that answers the question you have in mind, or whether you are wondering about a homegrown phonetic system like Hangul.
This is the opposite of a phonetic alphabet, which contains a lot of information about pronunciation and less about meaning. So to move to a unified phonetic alphabet you need a unified pronunciation, and China didn't have one.
When it comes to spoken "Chinese", the 7 "groups" of the language are mutually unintelligible. Someone who only understood Mandarin would not understand someone who only understood Hakka would not understand someone who only understood Min and so on.
No. Traditional and Simplified Chinese refer to scripts, whereas Cantonese and Mandarin are relatively mutually unintelligible spoken languages in the Sinitic family. Most Taiwanese people speak Mandarin (or Hokkien) and read/write in Traditional script, wheras most Mainland Chinese speak Mandarin and read/write in Simplified script. Many people in Guangdong Province speak Cantonese and read/write in Simplified, while most people in Hong Kong speak Cantonese and read/write in Traditional.
