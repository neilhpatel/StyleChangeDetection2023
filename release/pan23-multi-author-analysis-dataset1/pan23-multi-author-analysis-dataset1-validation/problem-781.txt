In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yeah. Probably a fabricated story to begin with but I have heard of a Jesus birthday in September and also in April based on either events described in the gospels or astronomical calculation for when "The star of Bethlehem" might have been observed. Definitely a church hijack of the older winter solstice observance though.
