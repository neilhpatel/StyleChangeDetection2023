Why didn't everyone flip to the communists? Well it's difficult to actually say exactly why but broadly speaking we could say that the Communist party was associated very heavily with violent uprisings/attempts at revolution which did them no favors in terms of PR. They also had very documented ties to Moscow which again was not necessarily helpful for electoral success. Moreover they were very unwilling to cooperate with the only party that was even remotely close to them Ideologically (the SPD) which meant that realistically the only way they could govern was by winning an outright majority which they were far, far from being able to do (Their best performance in late 1932 saw them winning 100 seats in the Reichstag, almost 300 was needed for a majority).
Thank you for the response, I am actually reading Paxton right now, that is why I asked this question! I just couldn't wrap my head around his general order of events and fascism's direct relationships with communism. Weitz is also on my bookshelf too.
I would also add that there were almost certainly some people who believed that some of the rhetoric used by the Nazi's was not truly going to be delivered upon (IE: They probably aren't REALLY going to liberate workers so they also probably aren't REALLY going to persecute the Jews). This unfortunately was a belief by quite a few conservative politicians at the time, second-guessing exactly which elements of the ill defined platform of the Nazis was genuine would often be a fatal mistake made by a LOT of figures from this time.
Even though the Nazi's seem like the obvious WRONG choice for who to support electorally now, at the time their exact stance and beliefs and what a government under them would look like were a lot less properly defined. And when you combine this with a population that is disillusioned with the predominant political parties and process you often get a lot of radicalization. Only in this case the left was not able to coalesce while the right-wing was. (Again this is a fairly common occurrence in many modern histories.
