For sure, some sites seemed like you could, they made it out to look simpler than it was. I figured this wasn't the best place to ask, was hoping more if someone could point me in the right direction of at least looking at laws/plans, but you are right, that would probably be my best bet. Thanks!
In the process of adoption (my experience is through dependency as a social worker but it still applies in family court) the biological father is entitled to due process and notification of termination of parental rights. In dependency court, he has to be notified in person 45 days before the hearing where parental rights are recommended to be terminated, or there's a process to publish the notice in the newspaper or serve the father by an attorney. If the father is not notified, it can nullify your adoption. In my experience, it does not matter if the father has a paternity test, signed a birth certificate, or anything like that, if the person is most likely the father then he is entitled to notice.
