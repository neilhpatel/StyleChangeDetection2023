There was a certain degree of cautious embracement in many quarters, especially among the working class, to American occupation, once it revealed itself as somewhat benevolent (if totally intolerant of dissent). There was a growing belief that life could now return to something close to normal, and many more liberally minded were hopeful that the corrupt imperial cabal of officers and bureaucrats, who'd lived lavishly in a time of great struggle, might be finally done away with. This fueled collaboration and complacency.
it's a bit polemical, but John Dower, the guy who literally wrote the book (Embracing Defeat is really good) on occupied Japan was quite critical of attempts to compare Iraq to Japan. Here he is.
Japan in 1945 was not an exact analogy to Germany, but they both shared quite a few similar features: a highly educated, literate population, a diversified industrial economy, and a history of parliamentary politics. Also, after 1945 neither were involved in wars, especially civil wars. These are features that they wouldn't have shared with post-colonial/developing countries like the ones mentioned.
