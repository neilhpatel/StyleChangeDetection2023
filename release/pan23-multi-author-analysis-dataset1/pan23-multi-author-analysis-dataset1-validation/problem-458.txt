So assuming we resolve all this, would having a different person’s PayPal be a solution to allow us to continue as we have? We raise about $2k a month, and we have a number of people organizing this. So each month we switch the recipient of the donation to another person? This way no single person reaches the threshold and therefore triggers an audit making us pay taxes on these funds we are donating, or would this lead to further issues? Thank you so much you’re a life saver.
Given that that the $26,000 received was not for goods and services (it was for charitable donations - no different than if OP had gone around with a collection box and at the end of the day given all of the cash in the box to a charitable organization), could the OP just not report the $26,000 as income in next year's return, since the fact of the matter is, no income was actually received?
Thank you very much! So assuming we resolve all this, would having a different person’s PayPal be a solution to allow us to continue as we have? We raise about $2k a month, and we have a number of people organizing this. So each month we switch the recipient of the donation to another person?
