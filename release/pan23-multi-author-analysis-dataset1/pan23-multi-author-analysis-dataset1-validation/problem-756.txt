Excess Mortality in the Soviet Union: A Reconsideration of the Demographic Consequences of Forced Industrialization, 1929â€“1949 - Rosefielde.
How does this relate to the age old trope of "the kulaks deserved it"? Now, as i understood it, kulaks where a vaguely defined group of peopl who were supposed to be "rich" (if by rich you mean owning a small teahouse) but what i also understand is that some killing and burning of crops happend. How do hsitroians relate this to the joke itself? Do we know how much of an effect did killing livestock and burning grain really affect the famine? I know of the many reasons why the soviet system was responsible for this, including lack of coping of the famine, excesive collections of grain, over sowing, and of course, the poor state of state animals. But i couldn't really find much accesible information about Peasant resistance to soviet rule, which i understand, is more complex than burning crops and killing animals, but my question was in wich way this affected the famine.
It kind of does. When dealing with history it is usually the norm to deal in the names that were in use at the time. If I'm writing about Russia today I might talk about Volgograd. If I'm talking about the USSR in WW2 I will call it Stalingrad and if I'm talking about Imperial Russia I will refer to it as Tsaritsyn. If the names are very dissimilar I might add something like "present day Volgograd" to make it easier for a reader who may not be familiar with the imperial history of Russia but I, nor any historian I'm familiar with, will talk about the Battle of Volgograd because this does nothing but confuse the reader.
Doesn't really change anything. It's not like others are writing using antiquated and today politically insensitive terms just because that is how things were called back then.
