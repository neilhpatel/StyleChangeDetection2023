To piggyback off of the answer by /u/sunagainstgold - medieval and early modern Middle Eastern cities were also divided into named neighborhoods (usually called محله/mahalla), the number and exact boundaries of which changed over time. As houses lacked specific addresses, someone seeking out a specific building or a specific person would have to resort to asking people for directions, but this was more reliable than it sounds. Neighborhoods were small enough, and communal bonds were tight enough, that any given inhabitant of a neighborhood would likely know of most other inhabitants of the neighborhood, or at the very least would know whom to ask in order to find out. This can be observed in the Sharia court records of the Ottoman period, in which one might find someone's dwelling described as follows: "a house located in Lala Pasha Neighborhood, bounded on two sides by a public road, on one side by the house of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Shaykh Ahmed, on another side by the house of Sinan Ağa," with the expectation that everyone would be familiar with who those people were and where they lived such that they could use them as reference points to spatially orient themselves. Or even more explicitly: "a house in Lala Pasha neighborhood, the boundaries of which are well known.".
While sources for information like addresses might be harder to find, wouldn't something approaching a modernish address structure have been necessary to navigate in these ancient cities or is there any evidence that they simply used systems similar to what was used in later European history? Not all cities anciently were quite so tiny.
The first attempt to establish a standing postal service happened at the very end of the fifteenth century in the Holy Roman Empire (under Maximilian), and specifically related to conventions of the Reichstag. It was really Charles V whose reestablishment of the system that broadened its use.
