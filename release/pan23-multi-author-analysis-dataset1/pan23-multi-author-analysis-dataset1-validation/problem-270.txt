Insurrectionist?? Give me a break. People hate Trump so much that they will go to any lenhs to keep him from running again. You really think a couple of people with flag poles and sticks can take over the government? The rest of the people would have had to resort to fisticuffs to do the job. This is the same as the attempts at impeachment that never went through.
