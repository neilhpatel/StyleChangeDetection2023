in your parole conditions you have to submit to random UA. military pulled the same shit with us, drop everything and go! Unfortunately nobody cares you like your job. And at this point in time you don't have the freedoms to decide. Comply with the test. Comply with what's asked. Arguing and resisting will just get you on the shit list and any further defiance or lack of obedience puts you deeper in the shitlist and will be used against you later. Just do what the dude wants and do it snappy. Once you stroke his ego a little then they might work with you. I commend you for being a good person. Get your shit together man. Make it your bitch.
“ Testing may be conducted at scheduled office visits; however, if the client is contacted prior to or after the scheduled visit to report for testing, the client shall have 24 hours (or the next business day) upon contact to report to the DPO or designated satellite office, as applicable, to submit a urinalysis (UA).”.
I get that man, I do. But, if I lose my job I'll be violating my parole terms. My work will not allow me to just leave. My past job worked with the state because they did on the site drug testing. Can't have your workers doing hard labor and being drunk or high. Get me?
I’m not sure if the terms of your parole are different somehow, but if this is the policy governing it, it really doesn’t seem like on the spot testing outside of a scheduled in person meeting is a requirement.
THANK YOU. Holy shit. That means he's full of shit. He came and drug tested me at 6AM. Negative. He was hoping it was positive.
A word of caution (and presumably why my post is downvoted, I’d hope they would point out factual issues) - the PO is going to have a lot of latitude, and approaching him with this, even respectfully and in a non confrontational manner, might piss him off and make things worse for you. So be careful and think about what is worth fighting. Good luck OP.
