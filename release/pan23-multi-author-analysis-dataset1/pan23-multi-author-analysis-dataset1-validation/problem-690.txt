The history of democracy as an idea is long and complicated and I can't do it justice here. The main thing I can do is recommend Jennifer T. Roberts' Athens on Trial (1994), which lays out the uninterrupted two-thousand-year anti-democratic tradition in Western political thought. It's pretty incredible to us from our modern perspective, in which democracy is considered an absolute good, but for most of recorded history it was universally regarded as a nearly absolute evil. The form of goverment we've ended up calling democracy was initially designed to be nothing like democracy, and its pioneer (the US) wasn't actually called a "democracy" until about half a century after its foundation.
There are complicated reasons why we've nevertheless ended up referring to this system as "democracy". In part, it was to do with a general rehabilitation of Classical Athens that began with the work of the ancient historian George Grote in the 1840s. In part, it was to do with the fact that the American experiment seemed to be working; Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America (1835) did much to spread the idea that the system they had introduced had a positive effect on their citizens. Under the influence of works like his, the word began to change its meaning from direct to representative government, allowing its nature and value to be redefined. In part, too, it was because liberal elites in the UK and elsewhere genuinely started to believe that more people deserved a voice in government, even if their proposals were modest at first. There was a growing sense that only representative democracy could guarantee individual rights, private property, freedom of speech, and other political values that had only recently been articulated. Finally, all of these reasons were cemented during the World Wars, when countries like the UK and the US could more or less rightly claim to represent (parliamentary) democracy against the absolutism or totalitarian despotism of their enemies.
Amazing answer. This is a tangentially related question, and I'm not sure if it's your area of expertise, but could you elaborate on the government system of Carthage post-2nd Punic War after Hannibal's reforms?
