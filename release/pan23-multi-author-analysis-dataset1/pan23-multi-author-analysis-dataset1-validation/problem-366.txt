You included a link to fvap.gov. I can see where the states are empowered to send overseas voters Absentee Ballot Applications by electronic means, but my quick perusal did not find how the voters could vote by email.
Yes, I agree that electronic / email voting would be much more convenient, but it opens the door for increased fraud, as well as complaints from voters who supposedly do not have email access, but want similar convenience.
With all the (unfounded) complaints of fraudulent voting, methinks opening the entire state to email voting would cause a much heavier workload on the verification process to try to assure the absence of fraud.
Thanks for the comment. Here is the page for North Carolina email voting under UOCAVA. True, I don't know if specifically the email practice has been adopted by other states. But the question remains why overseas citizens would be granted access to different absentee voting practices than residents.
