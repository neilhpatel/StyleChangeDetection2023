I remember reading in Geoffrey Parker's The Military Revolution that the introduction of gunpowder made such an impact in western Europe because it lent itself so well to siege warfare, like you said rather than the kind of warfare practiced in China. Thus helping would be centralising powers to demolish entrenched, literally and figuratively, local powers, like petty lords or autonomous chartered towns. Thus bringing down walls became a way to reign in authority as well. That makes sense?
Medieval history is notoriously difficult place: sources are generally few, and often difficult to understand. The details of the recipes and who actually wrote them down may be hard to nail down. But I think Chase is on solid ground in saying the Mongols brought fire weapons with them, using various kinds of gunpowder, word got out to the Europeans how they worked. Chase does go into a good bit of detail on the Chinese sources, which is convenient, as it's drawn from the recent firearms and gunpowder research in Joseph Needham's series Science and Technology in China , and that series can be a bit hard to access, especially now.
