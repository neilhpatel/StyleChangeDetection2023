Beside him being sincere I don't know if this is the case and the facts you report are perhaps conjectural. Maybe he was sincere, maybe he had to show the country he was scinere, but in fact he wasn't and in the depth of his heart was still a hugeont. Who knows?
For later Bourbons, this picture changes a bit: Louis XIV, while not too much interested in religion in his youth, took a turn towards strong Catholicism later in his life, possibly due to the influence of his morganatic second wife Madame de Maintenon. The most famous example of this is the Edict of Fontainebleau, which ended whatever religious tolerance remained of the Edict of Nantes (although this edict had been slowly dismantled over almost one century, mostly because of its political impoications). Louis XV renewed persecution of Calvinists by the declaration of 1724, while Louis XVI was more tolerant (he officially recognized Reformed religion, as well as Judaism, in 1787) (yes, the Revolution guillotined the wrong Louis, this was a relatively decent Bourbon...).
After the Revolution, of course the attitudes of the later Bourbons were very much shaped by the Revolution itself; the shock of having guillotined Louis XVI pushed pretty much all of them to the fundamentalist side (moreover, the kind of people who still supported Bourbons in the 19th century tended to be fundamentalists already). The last two French Bourbons (Louis XVI's brothers, Louis XVIII and Charles X) were much closer to the Church (for example, Charles X was toppled in part because of pushing a law imposing the death penalty for profaning the Eucharist â€” this was already completely anachronic by 1830).
