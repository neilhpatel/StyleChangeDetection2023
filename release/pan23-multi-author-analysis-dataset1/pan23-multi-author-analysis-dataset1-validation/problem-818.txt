This is a pretty interesting question, not least because the job you're doing in London and the date you are considering emigration to India are going to make things a lot harder for you than you might imagine. Broadly speaking, you've picked almost the worst possible time to realise the ambitions that you have, and you would find it potentially very difficult to improve your lot in India in this period, much less make your fortune; odds are, in fact, that your attempt to "better yourself" would quite possibly kill you.
3. In better paid positions, particularly the professions, salaries were indicated in annual amounts. Two positions for which information is available are:
Definitely. The translation thing in particular has also bugged me since the Last Mughal. Mehmood Farooqui should have been co-author on that book given how Dalrymple makes it sound as if the archive had previously been untapped by historians (it hadn't.).
There were never absolute obstacles in the way of private emigration to India, though prior to the 1830s you would have needed the approval of the EIC to travel within India; this rule was aimed mainly at preventing missionaries causing trouble by pursing their vocations in the interior. The point was that such people were outside the networks that would have best guaranteed access to the real wealth available in India. Private merchants trading on their own account, for instance, would have lacked the access to capital and, more importantly, access to the coercive power of the EIC army to maximise their potential for profit.

Migration was expensive. And the cost of passage had to be borne. If a person had money of their own they could, in theory, simply buy passage and go to India and then try and seek work. This was not though usually very easy for women.
As I mentioned in an earlier comment below, the best starting place for the general reader is William Dalrymple's recent and acclaimed The Anarchy (2019), which sets out in great detail the discreditable circumstances in which many British fortunes were won, and also makes a much better stab than most of its predecessors at seeing things from India's perspective rather than solely from Britain's.

Yes, while it still controlled much of India the EIC did recruit a few all- European infantry regiments, which it maintained in India for security purposes, because it never fully trusted in the loyalty of its sepoys.
Yes, for security reasons the EIC maintained several all-British army regiments in India; in addition, and for the same reason, its artillery force was 100% British-manned.
