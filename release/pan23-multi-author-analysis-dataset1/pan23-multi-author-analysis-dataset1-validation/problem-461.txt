yes the royal families use to keep the crown pretty close in the family so that there wasn't a lot of contestants to the throne. so in some cases yes there was abit of inbreeding.
It’s worth noting that despite becoming a sex symbol of sorts, Plutarch doesn’t even eulogize her as being remarkably beautiful, “For her actual beauty, it is said, was not in itself so remarkable that none could be compared with her, or that no one could see her without being struck by it, but the contact of her presence, if you lived with her, was irresistible” (Plutarch, Biography of Anthony). The biggest issue is that the works of Plutarch are written well after the fact (Almost two centuries later, given that Cleopatra died in 30 BCE and Plutarch’s Parallel Lives are estimated to have been published in the beginning of the 2nd century CE) and are rather dramatized. His preference is clearly towards the male romans who are “corrupted” by Cleopatra. It makes his accounts of her to a particular extent unreliable.
