Honestly if we can remove the right for felons, we can also remove it fpr proven risks. People posting that they wanna shoot up schools, DV perpetrators, etc. This isn't really hard at all and anyone who genuinely thinks that red flag laws for proven risks are tantamount to skipping due process entirely, rather than a bump in the road a person can appeal if they aren't a genuine risk, is just looking to be pissy at this point. I get anger over the police controlling that, but we can have a third party do it so that police shit doesn't occur and bunk up minority groups carrying. We have so many easy and simple options but people want none of it.
As someone who is against the 2nd Amendment, it’s still hard to deny that red flag laws as implemented circumvent due process—not that the courts have a problem selectively denying due process explicitly granted by the Constitution, but obviously that won’t apply in this case because GUNS AMERICA FREEDOM EAGLE. Until Heller is overturned, these laws are destined to be struck down.

For example, constitutional carry. It eliminates visible possession of a firearm as probable cause to stop and investigate someone. I'm open to polite discussion, please someone tell me how this isn't a massive landslide victory for illegal carry.
