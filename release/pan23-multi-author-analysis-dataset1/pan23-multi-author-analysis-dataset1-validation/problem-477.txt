I'm particularly proud of the hundreds of Roschel Senator armoured personnel carriers that we're sending, as they're built in Canada primarily by Ukrainian refugees, of which Canada has accepted hundreds of thousands.
No it would not be. For starters, there are huge problems with referring to the US President as the US equivalent to the Prime Minister---both are the head of government; however, the roles are massively different. They are not "equivalent" roles.
Our (Canada’s) greatest geopolitical and geographical rival, which directly contests our claims to the arctic, is currently being decimated. We would be fools not to send tanks because they’re doing exactly what they’re supposed to do. Defend against Russia.
To wit: There are always Finance Ministers and Justice Ministers in Canadian Cabinets, because those roles are constitutionally prescribed; in contrast, we often have no Deputy Prime Minister, and when we do the role doesn't have any intrinstic powers and relies on whatever ad-hoc responsibilities the Prime Minister delegates to it.
The US are our strong allies. And even if they weren't, we could dump our entire GDP into the military, and we would still be crushed by the USA within a couple weeks.
