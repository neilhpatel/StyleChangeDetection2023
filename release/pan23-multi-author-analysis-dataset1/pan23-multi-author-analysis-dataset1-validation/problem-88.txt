As an Indian, I can say that many people here see Russian oil as a necessary evil. It has already become very expensive. I just wish we could drill our own oil instead of relying on imports...
Incorrect. I asserted that because BRENT is at pre-war levels, one can't argue that India is buying Russian oil out of dire necessity given that India effectively wasn't buying Russian oil before the war (the articles says that), , and BRENT .
1. The top importers of Russian fossil fuels, buying more than India are the EU (mostly Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium), China, Turkey, South Korea and then after that is India. (see CREA late Nov stats).
Well the western countries are out bidding all the oil in other sources driving up cost and increasing scarcity, opec is cutting production and our primary oil supplier iran is sanctioned which we complied with,so do tell me where we can buy our oil as due to our low income in many families (mainly rural and small towns) we can not spend much without going into a recession and cause death of our own people.
They who? India prides itself on being the largest democracy, and even in authoritarian regimes public opinion matters.
4. India is almost tied with China to be the largest country in the world by population and their energy needs are increasing every year.
