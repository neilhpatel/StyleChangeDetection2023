Then the media has to acknowledge the existence of such a movement... Since the 80s the news has let the evangelicals set the narrative that they speak for the entirety of Christianity in America, when in reality it's a pretty diverse group that encompasses both Southern Baptists and the United Church of Christ and everything in between.
I suppose there could be an emergence of a left of center christian political movement to counter the evangelical movement, but the denominations that would be leading (or more accurately, are leading it) it have been seeing declining membership longer than the evangelicals have been.
The funny thing is, they've been at war. Ask John Boehner. It was just a sneaky infiltration of the old Republican Party that they let happen because it won them a lot of elections. It reached a head with Trump, and now that he's a bigger drag on the party the traditional Republicans are digging in their heels and the fighting is more out in the open. But they already had one Speaker resign and another retire because the Tea Party/MAGA/QANON types were trying to take over.
