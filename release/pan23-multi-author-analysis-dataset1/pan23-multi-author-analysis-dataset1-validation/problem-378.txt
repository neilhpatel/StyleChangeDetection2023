Doesn't matter. He's still a tenant and you're his landlord. You just also happen to be his roommate. Having said that, this is a family situation and having an eviction on his record could hurt the possibility of him renting in the future. One way that landlords get around the hassle of evicting someone and it incentivizes the person to leave so they don't get evicted is to offer money to have them move out before you take legal action against them. That may be an alternative here.
You can either serve him with notice to leave, and then proceed with eviction procedures, or arrange a "cash for keys" situation where you give him whatever amount of money would help him establish his own apartment situation without having an eviction record and with a minimal amount of hassle & financial pain on your end.
None of that is accurate. You are describing an illegal eviction. You do not need to pay rent or even have a written lease to be a tenant. Your son is your tenant at this point according to the law, if you went ahead and kicked him out without proper notice he could call the police and have himself let back in, not to mention sue you for illegal eviction.
He's not. I'm up at 5:00 am every day. I just expect him to wake himself up so I don't have to walk upstairs and spend 30+ minutes trying to get him to get ready for work just so that I can be late for work every day.
