Some Frankish and Anglo-Saxon rulers requested the Vikings to agree the baptism in exchange of their concession like the payment of tribute and the approval of settlement. This was actually win-win relationship for both parties involved: The ruler could showed off their generosity and at least formal 'religious supremacy' to the Vikings in religious fictive kinship (god parent - god child) as well, and the Vikings in turn could get real wealth and prestige as successful band leader as well. It would have been also much beneficial to being (at least one-time Christian) to negotiate with their Christian neighbors as well as to trade with them (So I dared to compare the baptism as a passport above). As a result of this kind of long and repeated interactions between Europeans and Norse people during the Viking Age, more and more Norse people increasingly saw Christianity with favorable way, associated often with exotic wealth and prestige, and it is likely that some of them kept Christian practices also in their Scandinavian homeland. As I mentioned briefly in , some new ambitious ex-Viking leaders those who accumulated their wealth in Europe must also have found this new exotic religion rather useful: They tried to take the place of traditional local chieftains who had presided seasonal communal rituals for long, so Christianity and their clergy was for them a kind of auxiliary weapon to undermine their rival's political as well as religious authority.
Do you mind expounding with regards to these conflicts? Were there documented stories or resistance by the pagan-Christians and or non-Christians? Was this what you meant by my friends being correct in that Vikings turned to Christianity by force?

As such, a conversion would be as well a show of strenh and legitimization of social victory in the competition with other chiefs, the power of Christ being stronger than the power of old gods, culminating with Christ being the best shield of the emerging figure of the fighting saint king.

Régis Boyer made the arguments, in Le Christ des Barbares - Le monde nordique (IXe-XIIIe s.), that Christianism found a quick enough adoption thanks to its adaptation to Scandinavian mentalities, insisting on the strenh of God rather than its love, and stressing sin as going against divine law rather than a moral infringement, painting a foreign Christ as closer to native institutional and spiritual conceptions.
