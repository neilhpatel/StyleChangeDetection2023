They may have requirements about core work hours and meeting availability so you having an extended work day as a non-employee is unlikely to be considered a reasonable accommodation. Next time wait for an offer and negotiate a flexible schedule then, but it may be hard to find an employer who will let you work whenever you can throughout the day as someone with zero track record to them.
IANAL. Something about you caught their eye enough to want to interview with you. Suppose, for example, they chose 8 people to proceed with and when they reached out to those 8 people with interview dates, the other 7 jumped at the chance and eagerly accepted their offer to meet. The first thing they heard from you is a "no, that date and time won't work for me". Regardless of how fair or unfair this may be, the fact remains that the first thing you ever said to them was NO, I can't. I would have done everything in my power to make that interview happen, whether it was having my already employed spouse shuffle their schedule a bit, or calling in a favor from friends or family to assist with the children for a few hours.
NAL. Hiring manager here. We are not at the stage where accommodation should even come up. The question was are you available full time (which normally means a daily schedule), and you said no. I wouldâ€™ve moved on to the next candidate.
