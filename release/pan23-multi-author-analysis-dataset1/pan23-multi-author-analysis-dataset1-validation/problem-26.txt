If your asking what you should expect, I would expect (1) you won't get your job back (2) you won't be staying in the housing, (3) the only person that may have liability in this and potentially could be sued for the initial injuries is your friend, (4) no one can guess what the results of the potential medical malpractice is, but potentially you could see reimbursement for damages from the infection.
Thank you for the response and I appreciate the honesty. The only question Iâ€™m left with is about the medical bills. I had insurance through work and the company revoked it. I no longer have that, but have signed up for another option in the mean time. Also management was negligent in storage of the vehicle. It is against policy to use them after hours however it is rarely enforced. Employees are known to use them at their leisure. The vehicles are even stored in the housing area away off work property and employees have keys to them. Rule enforcement at this location are extremely lax, almost non existent.
