In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Indeed. You can justifiably rant about this should the Dems eliminate the Legislative filibuster or somehow wind up with 60+ Senators, but when voters keep making sure that there's 40+ GOP senators we can't get meaningful answers helpful Democratic Party goals through the Senate. Not in the face of the current GOP.
Texas Right to Life, the monsters that wrote Texas' abortion law, SB8, filed an Amicus Brief in Dobbs (much of their language specifically made into both Alito and Thomas's final opinions), made the same distinction, Obergefell, Lawrence, and the contraception case were constitutional abominations, but Loving was sound.
That is to make it scotus proof. A law that said states must do something would likely be struck down by the courts, by restricting itself to interstate interactions only it is pretty much safe from them as that is explicitly enumerated in the constitution. There can be another law that guarantees that, but by making them separate scotus overturning one won't overturn the other.
