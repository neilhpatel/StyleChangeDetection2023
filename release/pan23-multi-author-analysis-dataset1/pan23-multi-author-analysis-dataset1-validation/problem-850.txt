I know, I was just commenting that some lexicologist dismissed it as the longest word because it was for an outdated political movement so would never really come up in conversation while floccinaucinihilipilification would be a usable word in modern conversation so it should hold the title as the "longest word" even though it is fabricated as all words are fabricated.
Nope. No homeroom and I opt out of prayer. I don't preach atheism to students, that would get me in trouble, but I don't need to participate in ceremony.
Exactly. Losing tax exempt status wouldn’t impact most churches, because they don’t have a surplus at the end of the year. If the church lost $12,000 this year, they’re not going to pay taxes.
Not necessarily. Theoretically a party could win every Commons seat with 40% of the vote (if the other 60% is split between 2 or more parties), but they would still only get 40% of the upper house.
I've always like the idea of replacing it with a body where the seats are given to political parties proportionally to how many votes they get in total in a general election. It would give more weight to voting for minor parties as they could win a few seats in the new upper house even if they don't get any in the Commons.
