There was never a prolonged attempt at converting the Indian populace, although enemies of the state were occasionally forced to convert. Although Hindu nationalists frequently point out a number of temples were destroyed by Muslim conquerors, almost all were destroyed in the course of war or during a rebellion, and were almost never tied to conversion to Islam. Temple destruction is best understood as a tool used by Muslim (and Hindu) rulers seeking to challenge their political opponents, not as a religious statement (EDIT: changed wording slightly to avoid confusion). As Metcalf and Metcalf put it, the goal of Muslim states in India was to extend Muslim power, not to convert or oppress Hindus. This leads into the second point:
(edit: To ensure I am not misunderstood, since I don't want my post to be seen as endorsing any variety of fanatical flag-waving, a clarification: I am not making the claim that conversion of Hindus, or suppression of idolatry was the sole focus of Islamic monarchs, trumping all other priorities such as governance, enriching themselves, warfare and statecraft etc. Muslim rulers also co-opted local Hindu chiefs and nobles into governance and bureaucracy, and a kind of equilibrium was reached for pragmatic coexistence, but it's clear that the religious inclination of many if not most monarchs and the Ulema was puritanical in theory and often in practice. It shouldn't be forgotten too that legitimacy of these monarchs was based on blessings and approval of the Muslim clergy, and they had to satisfy that constituency too.).
Even Aurangzeb, notorious among Hindu nationalist historians for his supposed intolerance, patronized Hindu religious institutions and employed Hindus in his administration. For example, a quarter of his mansab holders (basically, men of rank in the military) were Hindu, and most of his wars were waged against Muslim rulers. Aurangzeb is a controversial figure, and I'd be happy to answer more questions about him, but for now I'll move on.
We are methodologically on separate pages altogether. Context is always a matter of interpretation, and it's inevitable that any historian or student of history would apply a context only through an interpretative framework. I would argue that the stated intentions of the primary actors have greater weight than motives imputed hundreds of years later. The weight of probability is against the latter treatment. Historiography is rife with interpretive schools started and discarded.
I suppose I have to repeat myself. Historians use primary sources as evidence in their work. When scholars read a work of history, they don't value its "interpretation" because its "novel." They, ideally, scrutinize how the historian engages with primary sources. I don't know why you think that I don't "question interpretations" simply because I happen to agree with the broad strokes this one.
And yes, we will have to agree to disagree, I suppose. I will mention, as a last note, that historians argue by way of citing other historians because otherwise there would be no physically possible way to talk about the vast amount of history that there is. I don't cite Habib, for example, primarily because I think he's an authority. It's because you can go find the cited source text, read it and its bibliography, and see for yourself how a consensus emerges from primary sources. You can then contest that consensus, as is the historian's job to do. The whole point of history as a discipline is to never take anyone's word for anything, and go see for yourself, although of course sometimes flawed interpretations and methodologies become entrenched. But, as it were, the same happens in physical sciences from time to time.
