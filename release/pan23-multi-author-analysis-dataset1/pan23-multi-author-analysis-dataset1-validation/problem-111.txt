you seem a little paranoid. prob some deadbeat wrote a fake address or some data center clerk misread a real one. either way, it's literally not addressed to you, so who cares? shrug and throw it away like the rest of us do.
Find an online telephone directory to see if you can find a telephone number or address for this person and send them a letter informing them that if they want the mail forwarded to them that they need to contact the sender companies and report the updated address. Since the mail you are receiving is from companies who might send out bills, it is possible that the person is deliberately using a false address in an attempt to send the bills somewhere else so that they can say they never received the bill and therefore don't have to pay it.
Right. Same here, for a few months. This person has never lived at this address. And these letters started arriving last Spring. I had been in the house 18 months and no letters. Since the Spring there have been a dozen or more. This seems to be a new development, which is why I am a little concerned.
