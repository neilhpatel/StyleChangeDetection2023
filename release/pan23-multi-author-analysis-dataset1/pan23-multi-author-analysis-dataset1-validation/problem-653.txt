> ...if you name your spouse as beneficiary of a 401(k) plan, pension plan, or employer-provided life insurance policy, and later divorce, your ex-spouse will inherit--even if your state has a law that automatically revokes an ex-spouse's right to inherit. (See Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U.S. 141 (2001).).
There could be case law prior court cases with similar facts in your State that dealt specifically with this situation and you might get lucky and find that in prior court cases, the courts found that an ex-wife beneficiary should not get the 401K if the divorce decree did not award the 401K2 her.
Even if the case law or statutes are against you, you might be able to challenge the ex wife ownership in court so that she may be willing to settle with you for a portion of the 401K so that she can get something out of it in the short term.
It is POSSIBLE and I mean possible that if the divorce decree between your father and his ex-wife states that his 401K plan would be kept by him and would not go to his ex-wife.
â€¦ perhaps an argument could be made that he obviously intended that she not stay as the beneficiary of the 401K plan after the divorce but he failed forgot to take her name off as beneficiary.
