For any charges that involve witnesses who talked to the January 6th committee, the DOJ had to wait for the transcripts from those interviews. There are likely to be differences in what the witnesses told the DOJ vs congress - they'll recall different details or respond differently to similar questions. Any defense lawyer will use such differences to accuse the witness of being unreliable - the DOJ needs to resolve them up front so they're prepared.
When the DOJ indicts someone, they have to hand over their evidence (Brady material). Due to this, they have to be careful about indicting people close to Trump while their investigation into Trump is ongoing - they risk tipping their hand on what they've found, or who their sources are. Similarly, they don't want to indict Trump yet on, say, the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago if they are still gathering evidence to search other properties, or learning what exactly Trump did with the documents.
I agree. Follow the law and lock them all up and do it in such away it can never be overturned. The process takes so long because they cant afford any mistakes here.
