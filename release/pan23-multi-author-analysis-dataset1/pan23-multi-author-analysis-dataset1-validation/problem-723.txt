The hate you're espousing and demonstrating are disturbing, and the irony is that it is easily manipulated into exactly the kind of sentiment you are decrying from the Russian people. How much would it take for you to cheer the bombing and brutalization of Russian civilians? If the goal of the Western media was to justify the exact same kind of behavior towards Russia that Russia is doing to Ukraine, do you really think you'd be so different? You're already foaming at the mouth to subject them to economic devastation; it seems to me that you (and anyone else in this thread who feels as much hate for Russian civilians) should do some serious self-reflection and think about how different you really are from the people you're so eager to condemn. From my perspective, it sure looks like a difference in degree, not kind.
I couldn’t hear your appeasement of scarily nationalistic tendencies, excuses for mass political apathy, and tolerance for authoritarianism over the deafening silence of the ‘innocent’ Russian society and the sounds of weekly Russian strikes (war crimes) on Ukrainian civilian targets.
sanctions don’t equate to a blockade. No one is using force to keep supplies from reaching Russia and if they did it would be taken as an act of war. You could say a blockade is the most intense form of sanctions but what NATO is doing doesn’t come close.
