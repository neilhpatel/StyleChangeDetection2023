I don't think the orange one is suing for being recorded. I think he is suing because he is not getting a cut of the audiobook revenues for the audiobook that uses these recordings. IANAL, but (1) these seem like different issues to me and (2) trying to profit from his brand is very "on brand" for Trump.

Also, by the Publisher's repeatedly being quoted that the recording was "for a book" and not "an audio book" it makes it seem like S&S never obtained audio recording rights and is now trying to spin it that a recording that was intended to be used only for transcription purposes now somehow also allows them to release and sell the audio recordings, which generally when it comes to copyright law, does not.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
