Also: " HR is supposed to be there when you don't feel comfortable confronting your boss.". This is wrong. HR is there mainly to ensure that the company is complying with employment law and perform various administrative functions. It is not an employee ombudsman, counselor, or whatever. Do not think that they are some sort of "employee safe space.". Anything you tell HR can get back to your boss (with a few exceptions.).
If you have a complaint about your manager themselves doing something that violates the law (such as illegal discrimination or sexual harassment), then your employer would have a difficult time disciplining or terminating you for reporting that directly to HR or to someone else in your company. Ordinary grievances about things like your workload or your manager's management style or them just being difficult to get along with in general wouldn't be legally protected, however, and you could most likely be disciplined or fired for breaking your employer's policy in those cases by complaining directly to HR.
This part is completely normal. Most companies expect employees to resolve disputes themselves if possible, through the chain of command if that fails, and through HR only if necessary. It's much faster for your manager to have a meeting than it is for HR and legal to get involved, and nine times out of ten the resulting solution is just as good.
