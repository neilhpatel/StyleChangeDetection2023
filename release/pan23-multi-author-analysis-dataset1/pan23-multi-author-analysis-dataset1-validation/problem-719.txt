All in all we were very pleased with the results. We got feedback from over 1,500 users, either via comments in the thread or else through the survey. For the most part, the feedback was positive, and most of the negative feedback was focused on specific issues which we believe can be remedied. A small portion of users offering negative feedback did have very strong feelings on this which were expressed in multiple responses, and generally reflect an issue which we don’t believe can be reasonably accommodated by this feature, but we will address that as well.
Anyways though, a simple majority of users did not leave feedback, and much as we would like, we recognize that our data isn’t generalizable to the entire population of our subscribers, even if we can have some speculations. However, we did note that there was no noticeable dip in subscribers, so clearly it didn’t drive too many people away. The Admins though have some data that will help us bridge this lack of active feedback, and we hope to be able to see some of the numbers that make up the more passive feedback such as clicks and views.
Exactly. I commented at least a dozen times in there myself, let alone Zhukov who did most of the work. So that leaves a fraction of a fraction of comments vs subscribers.
