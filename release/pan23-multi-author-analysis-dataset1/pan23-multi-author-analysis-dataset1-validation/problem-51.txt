Cool. Give those with student debt some relieve, and I’d be fine with giving tax breaks to those who already paid off their loans.
Absolutely. If Biden and the Democrats were serious about addressing the student loan problem, there were be an actual plan that addresses current debt and the needs of future students. A one time forgiveness help those holding debt, but it’s not a long term solution.

Exactly. Next steps will be them taking away theater and arts programs, so even less law/pre-med students. They don't realize that a lot of students major in something like gender studies or theater are actually striving towards higher degrees in other disciplines, but these other routes allow them pursue interests or develop specialty in their future field.

I finally got a new job last June but I won’t have all that debt paid off until the end of this year unless I can get another major pay bump before then, but as someone now working for a tax firm, they’re all getting wishy washy about hiring, bonuses, and raises because of the economy, so I don’t expect much.
