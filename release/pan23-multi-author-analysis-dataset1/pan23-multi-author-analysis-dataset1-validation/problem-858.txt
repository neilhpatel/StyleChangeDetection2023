A common term for assets that are considered part of the estate is "probate assets." Laws for the place where she lived at the time of death define what are probate assets. Probate assets are used to pay debts. So, the important thing is --where did she live?
Before you open up a bank account with the check, consider filing/giving the check to the clerk of the circuit court/probate court for the purpose of telling the creditors that IF THEY want to open up a probate case to get to the check/funds, they are welcome to do it (PARTICULARLY IF YOU AS AN HEIR WON'T INHERIT AFTER ALL HER DEBTS ARE PAID OUT OF PROBATE ASSETS).
Hello! Thank you for the information. We’re in California and if I am understanding your explanation correctly, this check that came in after I notified her insurance would be designated as “probate assets” and is ONLY use of paying off debt?
b. Also, if he asks the creditor to contact him about filing claims and he hasn't opened up a probate case, is he at risk by paying the creditors in the wrong order according to local probate laws etc?
