If you go further back in time, Bruce Milne of the Melbourne record label Au Go Go (who put out the Scientists' music) was communicating with Bruce Pavitt, one of the co-founders of Sub Pop - the independent record label most prominent in the Seattle grunge scene - as early as 1981. Milne's fanzine cassette Fast Forward from that year features a track by Pavitt, and Milne and Pavitt were clearly kindred spirits - both called Bruce, both releasing cassette fanzines at the time, and both interested in loud, heavy music with a punk rather than metal edge. Indeed, a compilation of tracks by the Scientists was released in 1991 on Sub Pop, and the release of that track was definitely meant as a tip of the hat to the Seattle-Australia connection between the Bruces, and the influence of the Scientists on their scene, as grunge began to explode in the mainstream.
In the Australian context, this post-punk musical style of the Scientists and other like-minded bands was indeed called 'grunge'; it does seem that the use of the word in, for example, Sub Pop promotional material ultimately derives from the Australian usage.
The Scientists had two phases as a band; firstly, as a Perth band which was a sort of precursor to a later band, very popular in Australia, called the Hoodoo Gurus, and which had more of a kitschy, pop punk sound. Secondly, Kim Salmon took the reins on a second version of the band, now based in Sydney, which had more of a market for heavier music than Perth. The first 'grunge' track released by the (second version of the) Scientists was a track released on a 7" on the Au Go Go label called , and the sound was further refined on their 1983 album Blood Red River (). By 1985, with '', the Scientists were increasingly confident in their sound. While there's a post-rockabilly edge to their music that is reminiscent of, perhaps, the goth-ish sounds of The Cramps that is not necessarily so present in the late 1980s Seattle grunge (Mudhoney, or early Nirvana, or Green River), you can hear how it could have been an influence on the Seattle music.
Very interesting. I also enjoyed being able to click through the links in your various other answers. My main take away is that I have a hole in my soul shaped like 90s MTV.
Often there's a relatively small amount of motivated people who play a big role in promoting and push a scene - venue promoters, college radio DJs, record label owners, record store owners; in some cities, the right group of people in those roles weren't together in the same time to exploit a residual interest in a particular kind of music, and in some other cities, those people do come together (usually they would be in cities, because often a scene is still relatively tiny - thousands of people, perhaps; most people in the Pacific Northwest would have been entirely unaware of grunge until Nirvana, because they would have continued going to their office jobs, etc, living their lives entirely away from the world of underground rock music). /u/sarahagilbert asked a kind of similar question about the popularity of go-go music in Washinon D.C. in the 1980s, and I would suspect (without knowledge) that the answer is largely that there was the opportunity for a scene to develop there.
