I think the location of the payload bay doors is less relevant in orbit than the lack of a mechanism to precisely eject a payload toward the ground. After all, if the shuttle rolls so that its doors are open to the Earth (as it often did, ), the top and bottom are largely irrelevant. ðŸ™‚.
Eventually, the US expanded its early warning system enough that the surprise attack value of FOBS was nullified, and their accuracy was always pretty variable, so they were phased out by the late 1970s -- but their removal from service was never because of the treaty.
Ah. Got it. So the fear then was that the Shuttle might get into some weird orbit that an ICBM wouldn't take then release some nuclear payload that would strike in such a way that it couldn't be detected by normal early warning systems. Such an attack would reduce the amount of time the Soviets would have to counterattack, thus allowing the US to have the upper-hand and breaking the stalemate of nuclear deterrence.
