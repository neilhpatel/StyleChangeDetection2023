Good point. But still, I've yet to hear a convincing argument from any of my Republican relatives or coworkers why they think the people that didn't vote for him in 2020 will go and vote for him in 2024, especially now that abortion is effectively outlawed, and gay rights appear to be next on their list.
They might be running away right now. But I remember 2016, candidate after candidate was the GOP hotshot, until Trump destroyed them with some stupid remark.
I could be completely wrong, but in 2016 he destroyed candidate after candidate. The bigger the dick he was, the more GOP voters loved him. No one in the establishment took him seriously until he was the last guy standing.
