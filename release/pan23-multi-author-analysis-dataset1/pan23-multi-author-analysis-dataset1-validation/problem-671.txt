Robin Fleming talks about how the "Anglo-Saxon migration" was really a broader movement of North Sea adjacent peoples into Roman Britain. This included people from Denmark (Jutland), and Northern Germany (Saxony), but also people from Norway, Ireland, and Sweden. The idea of the Anglo-Saxons as a purely Germanic culture is misguided and not supported by the evidence that we have available through archaeology. She points to the blend of clothing and jewelry styles that emerged following "Anglo-Saxon" migration to Britain as evidence that these two cultures were assimilating into something difference from either that came before. She views this process as more or less a peaceful one. While they was some endemic violence inherent to the time period, she does not see evidence for the mass violence that is often assumed to have accompanied the Germanic migration into Britain.
Gotcha. Thanks for the extra info, too! Didn't realize migrants came from just about everywhere, but come to think of it, settling mercenaries sounds like a pretty good way to get a diverse range of Germans all over the place.
