Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Sending weapons to Ukraine is positive as they are fighting for their right to exist. Sending weapons to Saudi Arabia is bad as they are committing genocide in Yemen. Do you see tye difference here?
My preferred end game is that Ukraine recaptures all of its territory, Ukraine makes the decision for itself on whether to join international alliances like NATO or the EU, the Russian war machine is ground down to the point where it can't pull shit like this again for at least a decade, and the west fully acknowledges that allowing authoritarian regimes into the globalist club is a losing game. How long would that take? I'd imagine several years, more than one certainly.
