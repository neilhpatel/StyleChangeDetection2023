My mayor was just reelected after losing the Dem primary. He went to Court to circumvent that law, funded by the Republicans, and won as an independent after also going to court to pre-approve that no one needs to spell his name correctly to write him in, heck, even his initials are good enough.
I don't see them winning either. As usual, it all depends on the voter turnout. I don't see how Trump could get any more votes than he got in 2020 because he hasn't don't anything at all to sway people that didn't vote for him. The Democrats have a bad habit of having low turnout. But they would have to have a historically bad turnout to lose. The only thing I think could change the vote is if Biden makes a major mistake in the coming two years or have an international incident that wouldn't be his fault but that Republicans can blame on him.
Reincarnation. Fat Don will come back as a female Guatemalan refugee and Meatball will be an Afghani who gets enhanced interrogations at a CIA dark site.
