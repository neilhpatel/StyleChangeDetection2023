The mancus as a concept came from Northern Italy, where it's likely to have been a bastardisation of the Arabic manqÅ«sh (to engrave or inscribe), used as a slang term for engraved coinage, and was used to refer to Arabic dinars in circulation there. By the eighth century there was considerable English pilgrim traffic to Rome, and it's likely that the idea of a gold mancus coinage came to England through that pilgrim traffic, especially after Ine of Wessex founded the Schola Saxonum in Rome in 726 and began minting coinage in Wessex.
Depends on the timing. Over time in Medieval Europe there were more legal openings for commercial sale of land to wealthy commoners, something that enabled the rise of the gentry to challenge the aristocracy in the Late Medieval and Early Modern Periods.
Not really. While you're wealthy to have a purseful of gold (though silver is the coin of the realm) and unlikely to be considered a mere peasant (though without a good story of recompense for noble deeds you might be considered a rogue), you can't strictly buy land or the seigneurial rights that come with it: they have to be granted to you subject to your ongoing fulfilment of associated service to the lord who remains your lord - and even he's similarly obligated all the way up to the king.
You could perhaps pay someone to grant you the land and the rights that come with it, but you're still still not technically the owner and you remain subject to expropriation if you default on your obligations (which you can't just buy your way out of, because they're subject to custom rather than the market - their incidence can be adjusted, but that too will presumably cost you under this shady arrangement as the lord still owes the same obligations as before to whoever's above him in the pecking-order). So "ownership" (least of all of those desirable seigneurial revenues) isn't outright in the sense of a modern freehold market unless perhaps you're the ruler - and even his rights as monarch only exist so long as he wears the crown.
But before (say) the 15th century did such arrangements bring outright ownership and lordly entitlements? Unencumbered land may always have existed and ownership may have became truly commercialised early on, but it would seem by its "free" nature not to bring the seigneurial privileges sought by our enquirer.
