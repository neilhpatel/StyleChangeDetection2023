It does need to be certified and stamped, unfortunately. Also I was born in PA (which has something similar, which I already obtained) but the step parent adoption happened in NJ. Sorry itâ€™s confusing!
Before you take this approach, assemble a file of all documents you can locate referring to your birth father as your legal parent: baptism certificate, family bible, school records with contact information, pediatrician records, medical insurance where he was the primary and you were the covered dependent, obituary of your father listing you as surviving child, etc. Anything you can think of where he might be listed as your parent. Bring this file with you to all appointments.
The misrepresentation that it was simply changing your last name and wasn't actually separating you from your father's heritage may go a long way to establishing your right to reversal on the grounds of fraud. The younger you were when this happened the more likely that ground is to go forward. The fact that it stripped you of Irish citizenship is another reason, particularly since that reason was never explained to you before the adoption took place.
