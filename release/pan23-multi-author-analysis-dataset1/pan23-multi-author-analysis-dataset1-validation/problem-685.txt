Page 21: "Support for these policy options in SK is driven, in part, by doubts regarding the credibility of US extended deterrence. This can be addressed through alternative policy intiatives that avoid the downsides of these options.".
If the US nuked Wagner bases in other countries, not only would that cause an international shitshow the likes of which we have never seen before, but it’d set a precedent; Russia would then deploy “tactical” nukes in Ukraine, then if anyone objected, they’d be able to say “The US used nukes near civilian areas to destroy our mercenary forces - if that is allowed, then we should be allowed to use nukes in conventional warfare!”.
Yeah thats totally what I'm talking about. Not them setting up bases in the middle of the fucking desert. They're not the Al Queda ffs.
Page 7: "Do not, under current circumstances, deploy US tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula nor condone the acquisition of nuclear weapons by South Korea.".
There’s a difference between using smart bombs to surgically remove illegal mercenaries, and using weapons designed to vaporize an entire city.
Sure, let’s just poison the air, water, and land for hundreds of kilometers around by escalating to the absolute last-resort weapon, instead of performing a surgical strike with precision weapons.
Ah yes, instead of using precision guided weapons to take out only select buildings as Wagner tends to have their bases in populated areas, just vaporize an entire city and kill untold tens or hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. Excellent idea!
