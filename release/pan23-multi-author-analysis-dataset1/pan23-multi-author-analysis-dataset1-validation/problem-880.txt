2,974 [Legitimacy] In Avatar, Firelord&40;King&41; Zuko lived as a wanderer/waiter before becoming Firelord. This was a contrast with his privileged childhood as a prince. Is there any real life e.g. of kings who were born into power spending years as peasants before taking the throne? Particularly Absolute or Feudal kings?
Too late. Fortunately, I'd already had a career path set the first time I visited. And I'd taken Archaeology 101 in college and dropping it after a few weeks.
If you are interested in a longer answer, you may post it as a question and I might have the time tomorrow for it, but in short, petition to the praetor ( though this would vary geographically and temporally - but applicable magistrate or, later, administrators ), who would issue a prohibitatory interdict, if it is merely a disturbance of property, and since whatever grows on your property is yours, so you can get compensated for that.
That would be cool! I live in Nashville and, coincidentally, I was planning a little trip this weekend to in Manchester. A beautiful spot in addition to the Middle Woodland Period history.
