She doesn’t need to provide a reason, but just bear in mind that it might not even be about your qualities as a tenant. She might have decided to get out of the landlord business, she might have decided to renovate & sell the place, she might suddenly need to provide a home for a family member. When I was renting month-to-month once, my landlady got divorced and needed to move into the house herself, so she gave us our 30 day notice. We were perfect tenants - she even apologized about asking us to move - but she needed the place, and she was perfectly within her rights to terminate the rental agreement. It was a hassle to find a new place and move, but that’s the price you pay for the flexibility of a month-to-month lease. If you decide you want longer-term stability in the future, consider committing to a year-long lease.
Understood. I guess it irritated me that she wouldn’t even text me back and give me a reason why. I’ve ALWAYS paid my rent 2 months ahead every single time rent was due.
