In order to better approach your question – on the antisemitism of Fascist Italy and the Italian people – I think we should keep in mind that there is a distinction to be made between antisemitism as a popular, intellectual, cultural phenomenon, whether “artistic” and elitarian or coarse expression of base instincts; and “institutional” antisemitism, that is antisemitism elevated to a legal, and even to a fundamental part of the institutions of the State. While the latter can certainly receive impulse from the former, and by converse encourage and facilitate the persistence of widespread racist and antisemitic convictions, a racial legislation does uphold or aspire to uphold discrimination as a fundamental trait of the State, not merely to protect antisemitism and racism within those institutions but to establish them as an unquestionable and manifest facts of nature.
Thanks, this is an excellent reply! I just wanted to contribute by adding a quote from Mussolini, which I came by recently too, about Jews and antisemitism before the mid to late 1930s turn, to further illustrate what the concept of the race meant to fascists back then. Here (the text is from 1933 if I'm not mistaken), he is praising Oswald Spengler's work and noting he appreciates how the German could speak of 'the white race' without committing himself to 'Darwinian' theories of racial conflict:
Translation by me: 'Spengler wants to clearly differentiate his point of view from the vulgar, Darwinian or materialist one that is now in fashion among the antisemites of Europe and America'.
'Spengler vuole nettamente differenziare il suo punto di vista da quello volgare, darwinistico o materialistico che è oggi di moda fra gli antisemiti d'Europa e d'America.' (quoted in De Felice, p. 41).
The Nazi occupation forces and authorities in Italy - those more directly and those more indirectly involved with the extermination of the Jews - while obviously sympathetic to any display of loyalty and ideological identification with Italy's German Ally, showed very little interest in the legislative specifics of the Italian Social Republic. Indeed Mussolini himself was quite skeptic, and the Republic never adopted a proper constitution and quickly devolved into a de facto rump state; an appendage of the Nazi occupation forces. Most of the German concerns, outside of expediting certain military matters of their own and the deportation of the Jews for extermination and of former military personnel for forced labor, focused on symbolic gestures, such as the trial and execution of Galeazzo Ciano and of the other "conspirators" which had "deposed" Mussolini. And, relatively to those aspects, the main tension with the Italian authorities was created by the various disagreements between the military occupation command and the "German Embassy", as those constituted two competing centers of power which often supported this or that collaborationist group against one another.
In general – and somewhat generalizing – the crucial point for the popular perception of the alignment between the two Regimes seems to have been the perspective of a new European conflict, with Mussolini's personal prestige seeing a considerable boost after his apparent triumph of Munich and episodes of popular unrest rising and subduing in direct correlation to the events of the war until the collapse of late 1942 and early 1943.
I know this is old, but I recently stumbled upon this post. I just wanted to ask, the anti - Jewish laws on the Chart of Verona were written after the Allies invaded Italy and Mussolini was deposed, which caused the Germans to invade and occupy the northern half of Italy. They then established the Social Republic of Italy, which to my understanding was entirely dependent on Germany, and was completely controlled by them as well. Mussolini had minimal if any influence over this state, and was essentially just there as a figure so that the new government would retain the loyalty of the Italian Fascists. This would mean that the laws were essentially written by the Nazi party, and based off of the Nuremberg Laws, and therefore, not an accurate representation of anti semitism in Fasicst Italy as an independent state, right? I also wanna make clear yhay I'm not disagreeing with you in any way, I just want to better understand the context under which the laws were written.
