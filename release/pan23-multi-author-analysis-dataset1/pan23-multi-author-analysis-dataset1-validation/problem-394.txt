Is your contact information up to date with the DMV? It's very unlikely this happened, but in most states if a vehicle is left on your property, you are able to claim a vehicle as abandoned and have the title transferred over to yourself. It usually involves the state sending you multiple letters over a few months warning you that the vehicle was abandoned and gives you the opportunity to go get it before the property owner can take ownership of it and have the title transferred to their name.
Well that depends. This private property is somewhere that the OP and his/her GF were previously allowed open invite on to. If there's no signage warning of trespass, the owner will need to articulate that the OP and his/her GF are not welcome on the property and they have been trespassed from this private property. If the property owner tells them they aren't welcome whilst retrieving the OPs property, well then they've been given a trespass warning. But it's not automatic. But it does make for another good reason to have an officer do a civil stand by if you can find one to make an appearance.
