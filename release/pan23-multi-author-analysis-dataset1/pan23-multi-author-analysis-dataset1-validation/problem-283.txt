They pay for my phone and computer/internet but I bullshit them enough that they don't think I'm doing anything against them - and I never track my history on my computer out of fear that they might see something (like this). I don't have any friends (the one person I do know is waiting for me in Colorado), but there's one other person living nearby that I can tell to let my parents know I'm gone. I'll do that instead of a note. The rest of my family is just as bad - and I cannot trust any of them.
Although I can’t speak to your specific situation, moving states and updating residency typically requires establishing a residence before you can update something like a drivers license. This could be mail, a lease agreement, a utility bill dated within 30 days etc. Additionally, Most DOTs will require proof of residency along with documents verifying your identity—birth certificate, social, passport, etc. If you have access to these documents make sure you bring them along. If not, you can request official copies from the state of Virginia via (or other state, depending on where you were born).
