I think alot of this is natural. This is called self preservation We naturally avoid the things that take us away from where we are trying to go and where we don't fit in (this case being that your bio mother is polar opposite in her dumpster fire state of living). And with how you have posted about this and how much you think about this, I'd say if this lady that is your bio mother had herself together, this would be a different story...but you aren't avoiding her because she is your bio mom. It's like she has poop on her carpet in her living room and more of it keeps showing up and instead of cleaning it up, she covers it under the welcome mat, and under furniture. You can still smell it even though it's not completely visible and it's really nasty smelling so you avoid it because of how uncomfortable it smells and because you don't want your clothing to take on the stink...this is more of why you don't want to talk to her right? There is nothing wrong with wanting to keep your clothing from taking on that stench. It's a boundary you need until this lady takes responsibility for her life and cleans up her messes.
Nothing, actually. It's a scare tactic used to scare kids like you into behaving a certain way. Unfortunately, it's a tactic that works.
