Prior plans to commit suicide, and permission to assist, is meaningless. Your grandmother - if she is still together enough to do so - can direct that life-saving care not be administered (so that she is not put on a feeding tube or given CPR if her heart stops), and if your family are making medical decisions for her under a power of attorney or an advance care directive, they can make that choice on her behalf, as well, but nobody in this situation can either kill a dementia patient, abandon a dementia patient without adequate care to die of outright neglect, or authorize a doctor to administer life-ending medication to someone not competent to make the decision to end their own life.
Yeah it appears so. For example, in my state, it is only an option if the person is within 6 months of estimated death from terminal illness, which really isnâ€™t useful for this type of situation.
None. Every jurisdiction with a death-with-dignity framework requires that the patient be of sound mind when they make the decision to end their own life, and that they be suffering from a terminal illness at that time. Most also require that the final act of administering life-ending medications be done by the patient themselves, which in turn means they need to be competent to do so.
