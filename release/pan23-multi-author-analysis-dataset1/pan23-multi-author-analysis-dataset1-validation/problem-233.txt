The Fund havening been frozen since August 2019, after the decision by former President Bolsonaro to abolish the governing board of the Fund and the action plans to reduce deforestation. This action constituted a breach of the original agreement from when the fund was established.
You're manipulating. The article clearly states the reason why payments stopped was because the Brazilian government breached the contract agreement by restarting deforestation.
Yup. Plus regrowth is slow. If you cut down and burn a 100 year-old forest, it will take about 100 years to absorb back the CO2 that was released. In the best-case scenario.
tbh with the current technology i would like to see more investment into creating more jungles and forest instead of protecting this one jungle, even tho is important, i do believe we have the information and the understanding to actually tackle deforestation it’s just that companies are to fcking greedy.
The (or at least partial) solution was given from the beginning. By having a foreign government own the land, it's now far harder for the local government to take it and exploit it. There are serious repercussions to illegally taking another government's property.
Forest loss and damage is the cause of around 10% of global warming. There’s simply no way we can fight the climate crisis if we don’t stop deforestation.
