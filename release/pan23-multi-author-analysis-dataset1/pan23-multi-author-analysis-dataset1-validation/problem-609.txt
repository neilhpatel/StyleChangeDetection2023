The NATO campaign on Libya severely hampered Gaddafi's ability to put down rebels, and effectively neutered his entire air force. If Gaddafi retained his nuclear weapons, there is no way in hell NATO does a total air campaign on a country that's already shown its total willingness to carry out terrorist attacks on western nations.
Libya would probably have either put down its rebel forces by now, or be locked into a Syria-like conflict had it remained a nuclear power with the ability to threaten NATO off its airspace.
Lol what? Idlib is not a “Kurdish” holdout. Never has been under control of the AANES, SDF or YPG/YPJ. NEVER. They have never held any territory in that entire governorate. Idlib is controlled by hayat tahrir AlSham and has been for YEARS. It’s alQaeda territory bud. Also, the AANES does not fight the Assad regime lmfao. They have been negotiating with them for a couple years but do not fight.
Yeah, unfortunately. He's crimes are so well documented, yet people, media and governments continue to disregard this war. The thing is, Russia's war and support for Assad in Syria is the reasons Putin thought he could do whatever he wants with no repercussions.
