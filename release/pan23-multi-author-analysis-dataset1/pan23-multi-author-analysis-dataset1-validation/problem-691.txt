a slow and very hard-fought process). Timothy Reuter posits that noble/aristocratic robbers (including those more or less employed by them) were actually the primary danger in the Middle Ages versus "career bandits.".
These bandits became a bane of the Upper Hungary in the decades following Hussite Wars and recruited from the Hussites fleeing the persecutions after the victory of the Imperial forces. They became disillusioned in the course of war but had enough combat and organizational experience to form successful bandit groups. Despite the name, it is attested that the 'Czech bandits' included also ethnic Slovaks, Poles, Hungarians and Romanians. They were considered extinct as early as 1462, roughly 40 years after the war what suggests that those who did not settle down, usually died either in combat or out of natural causes. On the other hand, the group of Fedor Głowaty or Holovaty (name suggests Ruthenian origins, much like these of his associates, Vasko and Timko, that are diminutive forms of the names Ivan and Timofiey, respectively; it is conjectured that he was born in Ruthenian village of Ruská Volová) operated in early 1490s, many years later and there are many accounts of organized banditry in the area written throughout 15th century, suggesting that 'Czech bandits' were only one of many groups of outlaws operating in the Carpathian region. The area, usually sparsely populated due to its natural features (it is mountainous with the alpine Tatra range being close) was quite notorious for its bandits that operated there well into 19th century, the most famous of whom was most likely Juraj Jánošík (1688-1723).
