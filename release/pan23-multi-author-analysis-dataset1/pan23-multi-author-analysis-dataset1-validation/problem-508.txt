Not a lawyer but had a similar situation with my folks. Don't do it. As you said, you will be responsible for the lot rent and upkeep after she passes. I had a terrible time trying to sell the trailer. Moving them is expensive and your need someplace to put it. It's a huge headache.
Given just the overview you have posted, a straightforward will naming you or your brother as an executor so you can sell the trailer and split the proceeds after her death is likely better than a DIY probate avoidance strategy.
Thank you. I probably didn’t convey this, but I’m not really looking to achieve anything personally. I honestly worry about doing it, and would rather not do it. And maybe I was just looking for others to agree/tell me why it’s a bad idea. Obviously I feel bad telling my own mother “no”, but I shouldn’t. I guess I should ask her what SHE is trying to achieve by this. I know she mentioned that she wanted to ensure everything she owns goes to myself and my brother easily after she passes. But part of me wonders if there is some other reason involved.
