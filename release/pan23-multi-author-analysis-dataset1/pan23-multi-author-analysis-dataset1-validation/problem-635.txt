Oh wow yeah that is my bad, it's late where I am and I need sleep, one of the reasons why this question popped into my head, sorry about the math. I'm not sure if he was still in Frankfurt, but my father has mentioned that he moved to Hamburg where he met my grandmother, who is Austrian but I don't know when (very likely when he was 30-40). You're probably right about the anchor tattoo as well. I might have a dig around some of his things, which he said I was allowed to do before he was 90 and just read up on his life. Do you know of any sites or sources that may possibly have a name of all soldiers/sailors, etc involved? Or is that way too much of a stretch. I apologise for the crude questions as well.
Certainly. However, there wasn't much of a Navy in the immediate aftermath of WW2. Most of the Kriegsmarine ships did not survive the war and those that did were either turned over as war reparations and scrapped or mothballed and scrapped. What was left was the GMSA (German Mine Sweeping Administration) which, consisting of mostly former Kriegsmarine sailors, were tasked with clearing the some 600 000 naval mines that had been laid in the Baltic and North Sea during WW2. The GMSA existed between 1945 and 1947 and was eventually shut down due to pressure from the Soviet Union which feared that it might become a foundation for a new Kriegsmarine.
