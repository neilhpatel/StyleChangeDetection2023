The construction material and glass on the ground again is a separate issue and again is irrelevant to the issue of the deposit, you should have told him to clean it up.
Yes he did. He paid me, and I in turn paid the landlord the full sum. My plan was to collect a deposit from the new roommate, with full faith to pay it back, as well as pro rated August rent, and then to actually refund whatever that amount of rent is to the old roommate, just to be nice, because I know it stinks for him to have paid a deposit on a place he never even moved in to (but I also think it's not cool that he left me on the hook for rent and he should learn you can't just abandon a contract and leave people hanging that way so I intend to keep his portion of the deposit to cover rent). That was my plan anyway until the landlord communicated to me that he wants me to collect a deposit from the new subtenant (k fine) but then give it to him for his "lost money" due to lease break fee. I'm definitely not doing that.
