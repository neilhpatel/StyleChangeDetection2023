Well again it would greatly depend on the hospital. Some hospitals don’t have the medical tools to intubate a micro premie. Obviously the longer the baby is allowed to stay in the womb the better the odds will be. Yes the child will most likely need medical interventions because of the mothers drug use. I think everyone needs to start having the conversation with the hospital staff about if they are equipped to handle a micro premie with probable drug effects. If they don’t have a level 5 NICU in their facility there needs to a conversion about moving the mother. I don’t know the legal part of that though.
I know you have stated that you are in a position and would like to care for this child, but if the baby is born and it has severe defects to the point that your entire future is now dedicated to care for this child, giving it up for adoption later on will make it very difficult for the state to find a home that has the ability to care for it.
I am sorry you are going thru this. You would need a family lawyer to clear up any parental rights the bio-father might have. You may want to start with a social worker from the hospital which may be able to help guide you.
