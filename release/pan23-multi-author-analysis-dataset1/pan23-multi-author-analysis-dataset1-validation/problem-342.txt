Everyone is right and wrong. When you sell a car in Virginia, you take the plates off. Not every state does this, but yours does. You either put the plates on another car, or turn them in the DMV to be destroyed. PA is the same way. The car needs plates. The buyer can bring plates, or the seller can drive the car to PA and then take the plates off there. Or ship the car. You're not going to be driving through Virginia, then West Virginia or Maryland, then Pennsylvania without plates on a car. PA DMV may be able to issue him paper tags.
Well, my personal experience says otherwise. Years ago I bought a new car from a dealer in Alabama, which does not issue temporary tags, and could not arrange for the vehicle to be titled in Virginia. The dealer explained that as long as I always had the MSO and the bill of sale with me, I'd be fine, and that I had \[some number of days I don't remember\] to get the vehicle titled and registered in VA. And that's what I did: I drove the car from Alabama to Virginia, and to and from work (VA, MD, and DC) for about a week, all with no tags, before going into the DMV to get it titled and registered, and I never had a problem.
another vehicle. For a new or out-of-state vehicle (not previously titled in Pennsylvania), Section G of Form MV-1 must.
