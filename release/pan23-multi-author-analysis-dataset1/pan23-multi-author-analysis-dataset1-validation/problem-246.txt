Hmm I’m not sure if that is the case for voice acting. I’ve done plenty of one-off jobs where they wanted an NDA signed for a variety of reasons. Like for example, I did a job where the client wanted to pretend my voice belonged to a made up company spokesperson, so they don’t want me to disclose my involvement since it would let the cat out of the bag that the spokesperson isn’t real.
Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or you’ve edited your post to comply with the rules, . Do not make a second post or comment.
In other words, it's not so much the disclosing of secrets or business activities that's the issue here, it's the fact that someone was asked to sign an NDA and then they ran and told the whole world about it, posting the entire wording of the NDA and the identity of the entity that wanted them to sign the NDA. While that's their prerogative and it's not a violation of the law, again, it's also the prerogative of the company to say, "Uhhh, ok, that was totally not cool, you can forget about getting the job now.".
