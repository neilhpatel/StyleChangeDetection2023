Absolutely. That was one of the things I set out to explore in my dissertation and hope to share if I can get the monograph I carve out of the dissertation published. It wasn’t just priceless gifts from royals: Wellinon used to receive unsolicited gifts every June 18th. These included volumes of verse, a dictionary, and on one notable occasion, a turtle from a fisherman (who received a rare reply from the Duke).

One of the most outspoken opponents of Sabbateanism in the 18th century was Rabbi Jacob Emden, who despite his rabbinic ordination and status (both then and now) as a leading rabbinical figure was a businessman, and not a communal rabbi (with the exception of the four years he served as rabbi of Emden, the city that gave him his surname); he lived in the communities of AH"U, or Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbeck- the Jewish communities of these three geographically close cities were united under one chief rabbi, a position for which Emden had been rejected earlier in his career. We know a remarkable amount about him as a person due to his very revealing autobiography, and it's fair to say that he was misanthropic, reclusive, depressed, and short tempered; his life included sadnesses such as outliving two wives and sixteen of his twenty children. Most fascinatingly to me, he owned his own printing press, which allowed him to function as the 18th century equivalent of an angry blogger- besides for his prolific Torah works, he also published screeds against people and topics that he was passionate about, especially the current chief rabbi of AH"U and suspected Sabbateans.
The exact date of the creation of the crown remains largely unknown. But the leading theory stands firm that it was created under the reign of Otto I around the 10th century. The Imperial Crown is unique in that it does not possess a regular round shape that most common crowns do, instead the crown is built around eight golden plates in the shape of an octagon. On the largest most plate, a cross is fixated at the top center. The crown is inlaid with various jewels and stones all throughout the entirety of the crown to a total of 144 total precious stones and about the same amount of pearls as well. The crown adheres to the style of Byzantine crowns in that it features various pictures and biblical scriptures around the crown. Although currently the Imperial Crown and the rest of the Imperial Regalia are kept in Vienna, for most of its existence since 1424 the crown was actually kept in Nuremberg and even bore the name “the Nuremberg Crown”. The most popular alternative name to the crown though would have to be “The Crown of Charlemagne”, even though the crown did not actually exist during the reign of emperor Charlamagne. But nonetheless this moniker stuck due to the fact that Charlamgne was seen as the first true Holy Roman Emperor after his impromptu coronation im 800 CE Christmas day by Pope Leo III.
But as important as a papal coronation was to an emperor, just as important was the very act of being crowned with the Imperial Crown itself. Because although many emperors had their own personal crowns, the Imperial Crown and Regalia had to be used in the official coronation of an emperor.
The Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire was an important aspect in the legitimacy of the sitting emperor. So much so that the crown was seen as an integral part in the existence of the empire.
So we can see here the important essence in which the Imperial Crown held to the empire. The crown itself symbolized the Empire, and with that the very existence of the empire could be latched onto the crown itself.
After following the crown through a greater part of it's history, the importance of the crown really comes to a culminating point at the cusp of empire's demise and dissolution.
But to set the stage, let me embellish you all in a brief (or not so brief) history of the crown and how it came to be seen as such an important relic in the history of the empire.
