No one knows our circumstances. And I guarantee they are very particular circumstances, one that you probably have not or will not go through. I didn’t mean to speak Ill of my wife I was just telling the facts. She’s moved like twice in her life I’ve moved like 15 times. So yes, I have more experience signing leases. Ffs. Reddit is so fast to pass judgement and assume I’m being misogynistic for being mildly annoyed that I noted my wife made a bad judgement call. And yet, here i am actively helping to fix a problem that I did not create. Because that’s what husband and wives do. They help each other. I never berated her for it.
But you pay for hotels by the night, whereas residential leases are generally for a specified number of days (or months, but those are measured by the number of days in a month and generally would be prorated based on a daily rate).
Good points. it’s not that kind of apartment though. It also doesn’t specify time at all in the lease, or a need to move in only when the lessor says so.
