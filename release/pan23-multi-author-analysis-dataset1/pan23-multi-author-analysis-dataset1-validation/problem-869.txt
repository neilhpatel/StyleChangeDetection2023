I would kind of agree with you though, as the 2026 WC will have 48 teams instead of 32. So Qatar will have slightly better chances to qualify going forward.
In my city here in Canada they built a cycle centre for the Pan Am games … it’s a cycling centre now, has basketball courts, tennis courts, they do giant yoga sessions, spin classes, kids classes, and tons of other things to bring the community out and promote healthy lifestyles … these spaces can be used after they are done with them for other purposes you know.
Is Qatar worse? Very likely. But let's not pretend the US is anything but a warmongering imperialist nation with no respect for human rights.
As if the US had any respect for human rights. Millions of deaths due to their 21st century wars. No-trial torture prison. Largest prison population, relative and absolute, in the world. Constant war. Etc.
They certainly tried during the age of imperialism like everyone else, but France, Britain, and Russia repeatedly ratfucked them in international politics so they never had the same access to colonial resources. Romantisizing the idea of an empire and wanting to be seen as a big boy is pretty much what lead to two world wars, the losses from which killing any gains they had, and it wasn't until after all that and the colonies let go did Germany finally "get ahead" in the modern world. So while I know you don't give a shit it is true that modern Germany's buildup came as they also learned to respect human rights.
