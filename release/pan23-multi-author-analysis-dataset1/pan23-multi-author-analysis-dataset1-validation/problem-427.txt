What "every time a thread arises on this board" are you referring to? I just ran a site:reddit.com/r/askhistorians search for "hirohito." Nearly all the viable top results ask some version of "Did/Why did Hirohito basically get off the hook for committing war crimes?".
The military would constantly use the emperor's name as an excuse to run the government, while also being highly disorganized itself. The top brass controlled most of the meetings with the emperor, and the civilian government had little contact with him. The disorganized mess of the Japanese Imperial Government and its complexity was communicated to Hirohito through meetings with the military. Only the militaristic view was communicated to the emperor, and only half truths in order to gain the rubber stamp from him. Hirohito never engineered any of the atrocities he rubber stamped the plans to, and it is hard to know whether he ever fully understood what he was stamping. Moreover, the military was a mess, populated by extreme death or dishonor radicals that operated independently of military high command, let alone the civilian government.
Thanks. I'm listening to a course about china right now which sparked the question so I'm hoping i discover more about his life and intentions there. Japanese modern history is on my list to read or listen later.
