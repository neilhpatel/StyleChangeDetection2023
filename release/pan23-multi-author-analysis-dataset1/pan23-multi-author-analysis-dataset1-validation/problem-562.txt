As someone that works as a paralegal, I second what this guy said. You were served with court papers regarding the custody of your children, so the only thing you should do is wait to speak to your lawyer. This is 100% 'get a lawyer' territory and I don't think there's much strangers over the internet can do to help you as these files/problems are pretty much handled on a case by case basis.
Document document document. Do your best to go back to record all the days / times you had the kids. Include texts from your ex asking you to take the kids. Include the harassments as well as any police reports made.
Regarding any harassment, explain with just the facts. Be very straight forward and succinct. In all your communication that might be seen by the other side, police or the judge make sure that you are the calm and logical one.
The goal is to make the entire situation as easy as possible for your lawyer, a judge or the police to understand and see any patterns of behavior. It is also for you to be seen as the patient, logical and organized one.
