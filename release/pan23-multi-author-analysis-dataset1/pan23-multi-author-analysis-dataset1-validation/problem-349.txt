I actually just had a conversation similar to this where an Indian scholar said, "Do you know which religion made the first crusade? It was Buddhism, under Ashoka, who then propagandized that he was now a Buddhist and everything was ok. Look at his edicts.".
In any case, Indian religions have been relatively tolerant of one another, pluralism has always been a value in Indian philosophy, however there have been significant incidents of violence between them, particularly in times where a nationality was being established, as seen during the chaotic period of the Islamic campaigns in India, where formulating an identity in opposition to Islam was important to some Indian rulers. We also see religious violence justified on moral grounds in religious texts, from the Buddhist Mahavamsa to the Saivite Timurai, however this violence appears to be mythical.
Thanks! I haven't looked at the Sri Lankan situation in a long long while, but Kent's paper has stuck with me. That's all really good information that only further muddies the situation of Buddhism and warfare and Buddhism and violence. I think it plays into Victoria's theory really well too on the concept of "wego" and how Buddhism as an identity is just as susceptible to tribalism and it's negative aspects as other religions.
