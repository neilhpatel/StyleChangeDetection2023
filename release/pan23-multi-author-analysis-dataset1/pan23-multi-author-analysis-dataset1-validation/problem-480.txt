That's because it's not a left right issue, it's a capitalism issue. The idea that we have to be 100% capitalist in the country is what we were sold and most of is bought. That's why a lot of younger people are starting to identify as socialist or even communist. Either extreme is not good, evident by the fact that we have social programs and they are very popular. All of the leaders in our government now are either capitalist themselves or are funded by capitalist, well maybe exect for a few. It's totally fucked.
If we were to operate with the word "legitimacy" as though no law maker or enforcer were legitimate unless those they governed over gave consent, my local police, my city council and mayor, my state legislature, all the way up to Joe Biden himself are illegitimate because l do not consent to their governance over me. I actively do not want them to legislate or enforce what rights I do and do not have.
