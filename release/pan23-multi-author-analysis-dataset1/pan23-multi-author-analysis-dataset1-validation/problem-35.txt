It will be a little awkward, but I think it would also be helpful to have an exact accounting of what is missing. If you don't want to ask yourself, maybe a family member could notify guests of what happened (in a general way) on your behalf, apologize for not sending thank you notes, and ask for an details about what was sent (cash or check, approximate date it was sent, sender's intent for the money, anything written in the card OP's son should know, etc.).
Setting aside the checks inside the cards, the cards had messages for the son; the change-of-address actually interfered with his receipt of that correspondence (and his ability to be decent enough to thank people for their generosity).
Definitely talk to a lawyer. As has been stated, it may not be financially worth pursuing this on its own given the cost of a lawyer, but this needs to be prevented from occurring in future. You need something legally watertight to protect your son's financial future. If these funds are supposedly being kept for his college fund, consolidating and protecting that fund is of primary importance.
