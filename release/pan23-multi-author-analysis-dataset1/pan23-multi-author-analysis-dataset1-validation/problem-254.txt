Yup the closest thing I can think of is the Unitarian church my friend went to. I remember they had their own sex Ed that was LGBTQ inclusive and my two best friends got to go and basically made fun of all the gay stuff in it meanwhile I wasn't allowed to go because my parents thought it would make me gay. Jokes on them tho I guess....

I feel you. I'm in red state dystopia right now. I'd love to see a school like this in my area. I know it's a pipe dream, though. I will gladly support this school and hope to see kids everywhere go to it, as a safe place to learn. Hopefully, from there, we can build up more schools everywhere, seeing as the Christian nationalists are trying to destroy public school altogether.
They are trying to shut down public schools and erase LGBTQIA+ students, diverting the money to start schools for Christian nationalists.
