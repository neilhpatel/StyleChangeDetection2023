If this is true, I think he meant he would blame another country TO HIS FOLLOWERS, who would believe it. I am not sure he cared what anyone else could prove or think about it. Just my guess.
Presidents are the civilian leadership for a very hierarchical system that is probably lacking in outside-the-box thinking. Let them spitball.
Well he's been under Putin's desk since well before he was elected so he wouldn't have blamed it on Russia, And at the time he was also busy trying to get under Xi's desk to secure some Trump branded hotels in China. Who exactly would he plan on pinning it on? Mexico? They don't even have a nuclear program.
Every single person who voted for Donald Trump needs to sit themselves down and think about South Korea and China being furious at us for causing a 25-million-person refugee crisis at their borders where the population now finally feels justified in hating America. The power vacuum could very easily lead to groups/gangs of people fighting for power, which would destroy the area completely, too.
