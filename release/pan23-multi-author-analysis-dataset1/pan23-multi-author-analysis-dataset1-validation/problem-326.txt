The first nuke finally gave the surrender faction the overwhelming evidence of American military and particularly scientific superiority (helped military save face by saying that Japan lost a scientific war, not military defeat) which would result in the absolute destruction of the Japanese people. While it's speculated that the second nuke wasn't entirely necessary, the Japanese Army general who was the main holdout still pushed back that the US wasn't capable of dropping multiple nukes. The second nuke was the final nail in the coffin to that logic, yet it still required the Emperor to give the "sacred decision" to force the hardliners to accept the surrender as they were holding out for three surrender conditions which the US weren't going to accept.
Well. They probably ordered them built. Ukrainian engineers and workers would have done most or all of the work, at the behest of the Soviet government.
Supreme overconfidence and disbelief. Early on Ukraine also wasn't great at dispersing their forces and made easy pickings for Russian strikes, but they learned quickly. Meanwhile Russia is still using their good old approach of "Just because it didn't work the first 30 times doesn't mean it won't work on the 31st". Besides its just more internal propaganda rotting their war effort, since admitting Ukranians can target that far with HIMARs that were supposed to be destroyed three times over is not something any career vatnik is going to do.
