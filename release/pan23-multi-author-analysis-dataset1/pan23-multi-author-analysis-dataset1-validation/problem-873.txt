Especially in the period 1917-1953, covering the Civil War, the factional struggles of the 1920's, and the Stalin era, the political structures of the CPSU and USSR were unstable and constantly changing and mutating. In practice the Central Committee was the main representative body of all local and regional branches of the Communist Party. These came together in a Congress once in a while, 3 to 5 years, sending thousands of delegates and taking several days. At the Congress, a more permanent body, the Central Committee, was elected and responsible for the governing of the CPSU in between congresses. This started out as a small body of some 20 deputies, but later the CC's membership varied around some 200 to 300 members. Stalin had the majority purged in the 1930's, and afterwards it never regained the authority it once held over the direction and leadership of the country. It degenerated into a large audience of Soviet officials serving as a transmission belt between the leadership and the provinces, and for approving and applauding the policies of the Soviet leadership, including its nominations for leadership positions such as the Politburo and Secretariat.
Sorry for all the questions. I'm just trying to work out the.. Governance structures.. For want of a better term.
