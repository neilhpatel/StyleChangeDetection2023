The legitimacy or the grounds for the lawsuit, however, are NOT the same thing as actually winning the case. \\What all of us understand is there is no way in hell Trump can win this case because the evidentiary requirements are likely insurmountable.\\ The foundations of his case are there since the 2018 Mueller Report came out. But timing of when those articles where written and the Mueller Report are essential. Trump's team has to prove that those writers were aware of the facts and maliciously defamed Trump on purpose. This is the tall order that has to be proven in court. This is what all of us understand and see why this case is a waste of time. But that's the requirement to have a legitimate civil case tried in court, or not. Hence why this case is moving forward.
Hmmm, Okeechobee County Florida? Odd, given that Mar-a-Lago is in Palm Beach County, eh? Why wouldn't you file right in your own...
EDIT: I think that the difference was that Fox claimed viewers knew that everything Tucker said was entertainment and not news (and therefore could not be relied upon), while MSNBC claimed that Maddow was obviously being hyperbolic in her statements, which her viewers could clearly discern.
My mom is in Okeechobee, I grew up there. It’s awful. You can buy confederate flag bedsheets at the flea market and it’s rampant with incest, child abuse and racism. He knows what he’s doing. Pretty infuriating he can do it in the first place.
