Wow this makes so much more sense than "a few hundred men took down an empire cuz technology and stuff". Really gave me a new perspective on this piece of history.
Sorry, for taking a few days to answer (I usually disconnect my brain on weekends), I just wanted to know that I really appreciated this discussion and the information you recommended to me, we would have to agree to disagree, while I completely agree that there is ample evidence of native political self-determination in Mesoamerica during and following the conquest, both in the form of forceful means (Xalisco, the Mixton War, etc...) and more political ones (alliance by Zapotec and Mixtec nobles and lords), I just cant see it in the case of the Tlaxcaltecans, were you see a willingness to perform double-speak I see and unwillingness to politically maneuver the new system, were you see them trying to mediate between traditional and Fransiscan powers, I see a willingness to allow the Fransiscan and the religious authorities to take control of their public life (which in my view aligns with their fame as a nation of priests as told by chroniclers like Tezozomoc), were you see Tlaxcala contrasting religious education I see them willingly forming the basis of the encomienda system and giving it to the church, and were you see acomodation, I see a willing submission... again, I can see it in many other groups in Mexico, even with the Texococans or the Chalcans who were in a similar situation, their efforts to carve out power and positions of their own is obvious through Chimalpain and even Iztlixochitl (who I always take with a grain of salt), not so to me with the Tlaxcaltecans.
I dont think that natives having agency (as all humans do) has ever been in doubt, indeed many clear examples other than the Tlaxcalans exist (Xalisco, Mexican influence, the Chichimecan wars, etc...), the interesting argument here was spaniard "allies" (the Tlaxcalans being the most visible example) demostrating political designs clear enough as to argue that they werent in a state of submission to the spaniard's own political designs.
I must point out however, that if the purpouse of the recommendation was to argue that spaniards werent in charge, it had the opposite effect in me, rather enforcing much of the conceptions and its role as a polity that was thouroughly subservient to the spaniards, and confirming many of my ideas about Tlaxcalan society of the time.
I found no evidence of that here, if anything, I personally found that the article unintentionally argued the opposite, that the Tlaxcalans didnt have such a thing beyond the isolated actions of some individuals (unlike MANY other native groups that actively resisted spaniard interference even in the Valley of Mexico itself were it was the most difficult), in this regard I found your initial arguments on the subject much more interesting rather than this last one, for that reason I think I will it keep separate on the back of my mind and spin it for a while, who knows? maybe in a few weeks I'll get a new perspective on it, again, thanks for the recommendation, I found it very interesting and complete to read, I've definitely saved it for future reference.
