The ordinance is saying that in PA, a property owner may ask the police to enforce speed limits and the observance of traffic-control devices on their land. Speed limits and traffic-control devices are not fire lanes or handicapped spots, so this ordinance is irrelevant to the argument being had. If the question is now, "can the police enforce speed limits or the observance of traffic-control devices on private property without written permission?" the answer is likely going to come down to the specific violation and what kind of private property we're talking about. A publicly accessible privately owned road? Probably.

This stemmed from a conversation about law enforcement being able to enforce laws on private property, where they were saying that officers can't trespass on private property (even though this was in reference to someone who lives on one of the private properties calling the police in regards to a situation on a private easement road, so they wouldn't have been trespassing). When I mentioned about enforcement against people parking in the fire lane, they started saying it's because of an agreement the private owner has with law enforcement, etc.
They are claiming that fire lane and handicapped parking laws cannot be enforced unless the owner of the private property "signs an agreement" permitting it. Then provided that law that I linked to as their proof.
