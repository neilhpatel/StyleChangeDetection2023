Plato says that Atlantis is a kingdom that exists on an island in front of the strait of Gibraltar (what he calls the "Pillars of Heracles"). He says that this island is larger than "Libya and Asia combined" (not that these things are identical to what we conceive Libya and Asia to be). He says that Atlantis was on course to conquer all of "Europe and Asia" and that the Atlanteans ruled "Libya as far as Egypt" and "Europe as far as Tyrrhenia." In practice, this meant that Atlantean rule south of the Mediterranean extended across North Africa to the western frontiers of Egypt; in Europe, they would have ruled from Spain all the way east to central Italy.
4. Atlantis didn't sink or get hit by a tsunami. The entire world (except Egypt) endured cyclical floods over a period of millennia. In some places, like Athens, the land reemerged and civilisation developed again, thanks to their moral fibre and the perfection of their constitution. In others, like Atlantis, it didn't.
Now, on Atlantis. The false premises here are the idea of a cataclysm (nothing of the kind is described by Plato), and the idea that Plato's story is about Atlantis (it's about Athens).
(a) take Plato at his word and commit to all of the above, in spite of the fact that points 2, 5, and 6 are demonstrably false, and point 1 can only be a joke. Point 4 is kind of interesting actually. You see, the thing in point 5 about the strait of Gibraltar supposedly being impassable -- which of course it isn't, and it wasn't in antiquity either -- this point crops up in Aristotle as well, and Aristotle has a version of point 4 too, in the same context (Meteorology 351a-352a). The difference is that Aristotle doesn't make up a lost continent to explain it. He just says the strait is impassable, and that's because of long-term flooding and land reemerging in a repeated cycle over thousands of years.
