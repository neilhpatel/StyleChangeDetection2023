For these reasons, their design for the “new State” was not the result of a simple series of reform, but the outcome of a renovation-restoration: a new organism which was the true expression of the active forces of the nation – no longer tied to the old, inadequate and parasitic establishment – and at the same time, embodying the complete and absolute authority of the state, restored to its original function of incarnation and origin of every right.
I was thinking about nationalism last night, so it looks like I've got quite a bit of reading to do this evening!
Others had expressed openings to ideas of a collaboration with other nationalist groups (Mazzini after all had promoted the ideal of a community of the nations, which were to be regarded as “the individuals of humankind”, the nations being to humankind as citizens were to the nation), or rather to favor the idea of a cooperation of the nationalities (notably, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was sitting atop the many nationalities of the Balkans, even if the relations between the Italian Nationalists and the Triple Alliance are rather complicated and ambivalent); but those inclinations – which played into the traditional “democratic” tendencies towards an expansion which was mindful of the rights of the other nationalities, yet opposed to the natural expansive direction of the Italian imperialism, which looked for an affirmation within the Mediterranean – were among the first to be restrained and quelled. One of the rising stars of Italian Nationalism (and one of its more outspoken polemists), the publicist Luigi Federzoni explained that “the Balkan Slavs were the kind of people […] the hypothetical suppression of which from the geographical map of the world would not have changed one iota in the history of civilization”. The Mediterranean and Adriatic policies of the Nationalists would remain a point of contention in the subsequent years, given the relevance of the matter (perhaps even more polemical than political) in the years of the Great War.
The Nationalists were at risk – pointed out Olindo Malagodi in April 1912, during a long polemics between the Nationalist “direction” (Corradini, Federzoni, Maraviglia, etc.) and the “democratic” fraction of the Association, inspired by the publication of a letter from Charles Maurras, of distinctive antisemitic tone – of ending up like their French counterparts, a movement of a reactionary minority, “xenophobic and antisemitic”. At the same time, the Libyan War had revealed a new willingness of the catholic world to participate to the “national” life – which perhaps called for a reconsideration of the entire political collocation of the Nationalists in relation to the moderate catholics.
It was under the pressure of external events – rather than as the culmination of an autonomous theoretical evolution – that the Nationalist Association acquired a more defined political orientation, and established its collocation within the Italian political landscape: the Libyan War of 1911-12, the national elections of November 1913, the Italian intervention into the Great War.
A distinction between Nationalism and Fascism was perhaps even more troublesome for a “regime” historian (albeit likely the greatest of them) like Gioacchino Volpe, who described the convergence of the two movements in the months following the March on Rome, leading to the confluence of the Nationalists into the Fascist block, as “two akin aspirations, but also two orders of command, two hierarchies, two mindsets” - with fascism gradually becoming “imbued with nationalism” as its political identity gained definition.
It is less relevant for our purposes to go through Gentile's understanding of the Fascist Regime in its complete phase – especially in the later years, when even his ideological contribution became more limited – except for the fact that immediately, since the beginning of the “fascist revolution” Gentile attributes a monopoly of the national idea to Fascism and discards any opposition to Fascism as ultimately anti-national. In Gentile's approach, the identification between national identity and fascist identity are not only a result of the process of historical evolution but an absolute unity, that leaves no room for any alternative experience of the nation. In this process, the role of the Nationalists was limited to the first attempts of resisting-overcoming the “demo-socialist” antithesis to the national principle; but, as we'll see later on, the Nationalist approach was insufficient, since it lacked a fundamental ingredient (the spiritual-voluntaristic half of the Nation). Gentile was, of course, far too generous towards Fascism, far too inclined to – conveniently – see in it a prosecution of the Risorgimento and the legitimate synthesis of national sentiment and modernity; while on the other hand, he found good arguments to limit the role of the Nationalist formulation which was, on the other hand, a significant presence in the ideological background and in the practical organization and juridical orientation of the Fascist State.
Of course, the Italian Nationalists did not share our favorable overview of Giolitti's years and saw in the affirmation of socialism among the masses, not only a threat for the liberal system, but the ultimate evidence of the inadequacy of the liberal system to safeguard and protect the interests of the Nation.
If I am spending a substantial time in establishing the role of Giolitti during the first decade of the XX Century, that's because his presence as a dominant and divisive figure was at the center of contemporary political debate, and influenced the first Nationalist political arguments as well, with Giolitti's system progressively growing to epitomize the various shortcomings of the liberal system. It was after all the reference frame chosen by Alfredo Rocco – the closest thing to an author of the definitive political formulation of Italian Nationalism – in his famous illustration (In piena pratica rivoluzionaria in Il dovere nazionale July 11^th 1914) of the nature of the Nationalist “revolution”, that is of their ultimate overcoming of parliamentarism.
When the newspaper Il Regno begun publication in 1903 (weekly until 1907) under initiative of Enrico Corradini and Giovanni Papini, the ideas of nation and national identity had already played their role in the Italian unification; the works of Vincenzo Gioberti on the “moral primacy” of the Italians, of Pasquale Mancini on the role of nationality as the fundamental principle of public right, and those of Giuseppe Mazzini with his voluntaristic vision of a nation forged around the affirmation of a national sentiment within the masses, had secured a place among the common cultural wealth of the newborn nation.
Already in its first issues (March 1911) the newspaper of the Nationalist Association, L'idea nazionale (“the national idea”) - among its principal contributors: Corradini, Federzoni, Maurizio Maraviglia, Francesco Coppola, Roberto Forges Davanzati – had begun its action in favor of an Italian intervention in Libya, a weakly held province of the Ottoman Empire, of questionable exploitability (a “box full of sand” according to those who opposed the intervention), where the Italians had increased their economical presence after the Tunis crisis of 1881. The idea of an expansion in the Mediterranean – which could serve to safeguard the Italian interests after the British and French had established their control over Egypt and Morocco and also to “free” the province from the backward Ottoman administration – was able to gain a significant degree of popularity within the Italian public opinion, with more than a few notable figures of the intellectual world expressing their approval of the intervention.
Filippo Carli's relation, eloquently titled “The economical policy for a great Italy” conceded that the Italian industrial and productive forces had benefited from the influx of foreign capitals – it had since then come the moment to emancipate the Nation from forms of foreign tutelage that threatened to evolve into subordination, not only economical but political (such was, after all, the intrinsic character of the import of political forms from Great Britain and France). To achieve that goal, the political leadership had to become an immediate expression of the productive world, of that “bourgeoisie of labor” which on the other hand had to suffer a condition of minority to the political professional, “most often the lawyer […] the speech maker” (this trend of criticism of the political system was common, and somewhat perplexing given the large prominence of publicists and lawyers among the Nationalists).
> to all those who can feel the vileness of our present labor, the misery of our national life, the poorness of the men in charge of the public things – to all those who won't resign themselves to be stripped and buried by plebeian violence and demagogic barbarism – to all those who strive for a larger, greater, more heroic, more glorious life of our country, all those who hate […] the backyard politics of resignation, and last all those who want a grand life, an intense, heroic life, over a narrow and trivial life.
