Under the pretense of being politically correct, the "woke" person is, ironically, asleep, in that they are ignorant of or unconcerned by the harms caused by their actions. Such harms may include:
However, something I feel that doesn't get mentioned in the same conversation when talking about "compliance": most of what's making it so expensive for people, locals and transplants alike, is foreign investment money and lack of rent control allowing international investment groups to buy up large amounts of Apartment building and Single Family units. This, combined with a massive growth of population, there's a lot of people that have lived in Seattle (or Portland, or SF, or LA) since they were a child, we're priced out of their home town, and are told theyre allowed to get a home...90 miles from everything they've ever known.
