Thank you, yes. My company has a similar policy, although they are a lot more casual about it in my department. We get the extra hour of pay and a "hey, don't do that please, thks.".
Technically, if you didn't take your meal break before the end of your fifth hour and your employer didn't actively take measures to relieve you of duty and ensure you were given a reasonable opportunity to take your break, they'd owe you an additional hour's pay. That premium isn't owed if your employer did relieve you of duty for the appropriate period but you voluntarily chose to continue working through your meal period in spite of being relieved, though, so it's not necessarily a black and white situation.
This is a California thing. You get paid an extra hour if you don’t take your lunch before the 5th hour. Employees at our place are warned the first time it happens, if it happens a 2nd time, they are assigned a lunch time. If they don’t go to lunch by their assigned time, they get a “corrective action” that goes in their file. No one has had to be reminded more than twice. We are allowed to give up the “lunch bonus” if it is our choice.
