Self-preservation, and not necessarily expansion, is one of the principal objectives of “The State” as a concept. And in this light, existential threats do not exclusively come from abroad. The state, especially in the pre-enlightenment era, generally existed to protect a certain class of enfranchised people. This could mean protecting those people from another state, but also protecting those people from the internal threats of revolt or strife (either by mollifying the disenfranchised, or neutralizing them; most typically via a combination of both). All this to say that war, especially wars of conquest, are not exactly a priority for a state with stable institutions. Conflict between states is often the consequence of specific conditions, and those same conditions often shape the course of the conflict itself. Were there ever the conditions for the Ottoman Empire to set out to conquer Venice? The answer is no.
I also liked how you acknowledge the possibility of individual Sultans and Viziers being interested in such a conquest. If there are any other Ottoman enthusiasts on r/askhistorians who can shed more light on planned conquests that never were. That would be much appreciated.
A wrench might be thrown in my logic considering the specific history of the the Ottomans: they do have a tendency to engage in wars of conquest (especially early in their history) but these conflicts nonetheless looked very different from their conflicts with the Venetians: Ottoman territorial expansion preferred contiguous targets with which they had extended history of interactions, and whose absorption into their empire could be justified on religious grounds, on the grounds of eliminating a troublesome (or threatening) neighbor, or even admittedly for plunder. All of these justifications helped Sultans garner support from within their own court, and ensured the productive participation of all enfranchised parties within the empire. But while the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice did come to blows several times over their history, none of these aforementioned justifications for a full-blown war of conquest ever materialized. A given Sultan might have at some point wished it (we’ll see gaps here and there in my knowledge of Ottoman history, this is probably one of them) but the conditions to organize such a conflict were just never there.
But even if hypothetically some conniving Sultan or Vizier were to garner enough internal support to ignore threats on the Empire’s borders on Balkans, North Africa, or the Levant, and instead devote time and resources to what will be an incredibly costly war of conquest or plunder against Venice, would this have been feasible?
Beyond the intrinsic difficulty of organizing an expedition against Venice, I'd just want to re-iterate that relations between the Venetians and Ottomans never really got to the point where any sort of full-scale Ottoman expedition against the Venetians could feasibly exist outside of fanciful musings (there is a period in the First Ottoman-Venetian war when it might have crossed the mind of Ottoman commanders conducting land-based raids in Istria and Friuli, but these commanders were not even able to stably occupy anything). The Ottoman Empire was principally a land-based empire for whom conquest might present the chance to pillage and plunder, but was also a way to eliminate nearby rivals and to secure their own borders. Venice presented itself as neither a rival nor a threat: Venice was a mercantile power, interested above all else in profiting from East-West trade. The existence of Venetian fortresses and colonies in the Aegean might have peeved the Ottomans, and periodically these would have seemed like choice pickings for Sultans looking to prove themselves, so you can imagine that as a consequence these overseas possessions and colonies were the primary focus of Ottoman-Venetian wars. But there just never were the conditions for the Ottomans to look further than the front close to home and set their eyes across the Adriatic and on Venice itself.
I think there are three factors to consider when examining the relationship between the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire:
And lastly, the Ottomans had more than enough on their hands closer to home during their conflicts with the Venetians. The size of the Venetian fleet meant that even if the war-fleet could not be in all places at once, venetian fortresses could still remain supplied almost indefinitely. The Ottomans expended enormous resources in hounding the Venetians out from their fortresses in the Aegean, and were seldom able to turn away from Venetian outposts they were already targeting to attack the metropole itself.
Thus even as the Republic underwent an irreversible trajectory of decline from the early 16th century onwards, there was never a feasible path for the Ottomans to justify expending the resources needed to attack the city of Venice. Conflicts between the two powers did emerge, but these mostly involved disputes in and around the Agean, where Venetian possessions and outposts threatened Ottoman hegemony in the Eastern Mediterranean (especially as perceived by untested Sultans). Once the outcome of a conflict became clear, the Venetians and the Ottomans always agreed on a peace. The Venetians did defend their possessions to the bitter end (in some instances to the last man) but when they felt the benefits of the conflict were outweighing the costs, they ultimately sued for peace. The Ottomans, disinterested in expending time and resources beyond an individual conflict's aims (themselves expending significant resources and energy in these conflicts) proved always willing to negotiate peaces offered by the Venetians once their own aims had been met. In other words, the relationship between the two powers and the conflicts they fought never reached the point where they sought to expend the resources and energy to annihilate each other.
