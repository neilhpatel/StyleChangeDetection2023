B) Was this forestry the fault of the British Crown? Questionable, but I would tend towards the negative. The English government, if anything, understood the risk of allowing prospectors free reign on woods, having seen its own supply of cheap fuel shrink dramatically in the 1600s and instituting crown protections on forests as a consequence. The English government specifically allocated woods for certain types of industry-cannon smelting being one notable example-in an effort to preserve the renewable resource for strategic purposes. The English also changed the methods of extracting wood for energy generation-rather than just cutting down trees, the gathering of wood debris and branches was encouraged instead, allowing the "stock" to be replenished rather than just cutting the tree down.
The short answer is 'no'. The Irish forestry body (Coillte) has a joint role in protecting existing woodlands and planting new growth, however the latter has overwhelmingly taken the form of commercial sitka spruce plantations, harvested for timber and paper-making.
