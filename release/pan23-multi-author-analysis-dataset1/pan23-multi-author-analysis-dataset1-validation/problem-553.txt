To me it's a stark contrast to imagine that some of the most wealthy and influential people would go to dine in Sir Richard Lyster's gorgeous banquet hall, wearing their expensive gowns, doublets and jerkins and all - and they would have entered a house covered in straw?
Most definitely. This would have, in fact, been one of the last places to lose that honor, given their effectiveness at keeping the space "clean" despite the mores of the times. What ultimately did away with them was a combination of increased accessibility to "better" flooring options and a shift away from cultural practices that made, e.g., taking a piss in the corner of your friend's dining room, spitting, throwing food on the floor, etc. during dinner a faux pas. As those things became less socially acceptable, a rush covering on an otherwise wooden or stone floor became less necessary, but that took a lot of time. It's not my field, but I wouldn't be shocked to discover such floors still in use in the country in the 19th or even early 20th century.
