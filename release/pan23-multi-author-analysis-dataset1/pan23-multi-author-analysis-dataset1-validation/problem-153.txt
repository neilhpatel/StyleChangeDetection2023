What resonated particularly strongly with me was the realization that a Madison Avenue executive with an inflation-adjusted salary on the not-entirely-unattainable higher end of the modern wage spectrum could comfortably afford the mortgage on a 5th Avenue apartment. This stands in stark contrast to the modern housing market in Manhattan, where real estate between 5th and 3d Avenues in the span between 59th and 96th Street is only available to people who can afford mortgages in the order of several million dollars (often in the tens of millions). I got me thinking, how many of the elegant elderly couples that can be habitually spotted strolling down 5th Avenue do realize that while they were able to afford their apartments after achieving a moderate level of success, their grandchildren will only be able to afford to live in their neighborhood if they join the ranks of society's highest earners: top corporate executives, financial services professionals, and entrepreneurs. If this pattern were do be extended across numerous high-income neighborhoods across the United States, it might explain some aspects of the perception of inequality: unremarkable older people find themselves living in neighborhoods where the only people they encounter are very economically successful, while younger people see that the only people who are able to emulate the lifestyle their grandparents enjoyed are their peers who have attained enormous, and anomalous, levels of professional success.
However, I can do more.. you can have me search for any keywords you want on any subreddit you want.

While median inflation-adjusted salary has stagnated or declined since the 1960s, executive compensation has instead multiplied. This means that both proportionally and materially, the wage gap between executives and ordinary workers would have been smaller. A complete analysis (and I cannot criticize the poster for not including it, although I would nonetheless have liked to see it) would have drawn some sort of line at which exponential wage growth begins, and determine if Madison Avenue art directors are in this category which has experienced rapid wage growth. It would be interesting to see if the characters in the TV Series are represented as more materially wealthy than their real-life peers.
