The Byzantine Romans were familiar with stories of mythic creatures from Greek mythology such as dragons, sphinxes, and sirens, as well as mythic creatures the Hebrew Bible like the Behemoth and the Leviathan. Greek mythical creatures were not just known from ancient Greek texts, but also from surviving examples of ancient Greek art. The hippodrome in Constantinople, for instance, included some ancient sculptures of creatures from classical mythology. The belief in some beings from Greek mythology, such as nereids, also lingered in popular folk traditions as late as the twentieth century.
Wonderful answer. Well done I saw this question and hoped that someone with authority on this subject would provide an informed answer. Thank you for rising to the occasion (you should apply for flair).
Thus, the unicorn probably originates from oral stories of some kind that were circulating at the Achaemenid court, but it was introduced to the Greek world through a work of written literature and most of the later Greek and Roman authors who talk about unicorns seem to have been relying primarily on Ktesias and other written authors.
Thanks for clearing that up. My only experience in the choice of terminology is specifically in relation to the drakon in Digenis, and most of the scholarship on the text uses the two words pretty much interchangeably, but with the distinction of the drakon's more serpent-like appearance being clearly established beforehand. I didn't mean to imply that your comment was somehow wrong or anything, I just felt that some explanation as to how the Byzantines imagined what exactly a drakon was could be useful.
