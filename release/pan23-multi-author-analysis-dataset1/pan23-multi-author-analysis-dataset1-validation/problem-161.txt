From my reading on the subject, this seems impossible to answer with certainty because of the two fold source and historiography problem concerning rapes by the Red Army in Germany 1945 in general and the specific lack of interest in the perspective of the 800.000 female soldiers of the Red Army in general and specifically on this subject.
The first one is that the history of post-war rape has for the longest time been written by male historians in a way that took no interest in the perspective of the women raped beyond using their stories as illustration for their greater point and took even less interest in the perspective of female Red Army soldiers on these events.
There is only one extensive source collection available in English pertaining to the perspectives of women in the Red Army: Svetlana Alexievich's 1988 The Unwomanly Face of War: An Oral History of Women in World War II (recently republished). The book consists of interviews with women who had fought in the Red Army re-counting their perspective, from witnessing the horrible violence exacted on them by the Germans, to the horrors of the battlefield and how they experienced it, to their hatred of the Germans and how it was for them to kill.
Júlia Garraio has written about the specific way rapes committed by the Red Army have been written about in her article stating that the image of the Red Army as a horde of rapists was not only a strategy of proliferating a narrative about Western values in Germany but became, together with stereotypes of the victimized women, a pillar of German post-war foreign policy by demonizing "Asian barbarism" and communism. Because of the raped women becoming a metaphorical stand-in for a victimized Germany, threatened by strange masculinities and barbaric hordes from the East, the actual perspective of the victims of these crimes, let alone other female perspectives were simply not considered in this sort of writing and scholarship that dominated the discourse on these subjects until not too long ago.
Thank you for the informative response. I’ve been running around claiming this was a valid look at life in soviet occupied Berlin. Even more proof that you should be skeptical of what you learn on Google.
In 2016, Hillers' estate was handed over to the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich and so Yuliya von Saal, a historian speciliazing in Russia and the Soviet Union, worked extensively on the estate and the documents that are part of the estate, most prominently the original typoscrip Hillers wrote in 1954.
