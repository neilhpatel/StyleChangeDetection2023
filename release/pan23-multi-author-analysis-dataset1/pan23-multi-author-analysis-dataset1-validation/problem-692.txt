It turns out that the landlord is not returning the security deposit and has instead sent an itemized written statement with some extremely unreasonable costs. He sent the itemized written notice to the rental property address knowing fully well I don’t live there anymore as a new tenant is already living there. USPS forwarded the envelope to my new address NOT the landlord. The landlord knew fully well I wouldn’t be able to receive it and that I don’t live there. When the landlord wants money or anything of their interest, they text, call, reply to email , BUT when I want my deposit back, NO RESPONSE or an extremely vague reply that doesn’t address my concerns.
It turns out the landlord acted in “bad faith” and since the deposit was $4000, and the landlord kept ALL of it… Potentially he is liable to pay three times the deposit he withheld which in this case is $4000 multiplied by 3 is $12,000. But I will have to get a lawyer as it’s more than the small claims limit of $10,000.
California? That treble damage rule is cool. It's designed to make it worth a tenants time to sue a landlord who tries to cheat on the deposit. The "legislative findings" of the CA legislature is that they want to end the practice of landlords treating the deposit as a revenue stream. They're serious about it.
