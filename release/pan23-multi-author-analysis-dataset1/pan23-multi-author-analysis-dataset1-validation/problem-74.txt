The declaration itself did not specifically mention any atomic bombs, it warned Japan would face "the full application of military power, backed by our resolve, will mean the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland.".
One should also not confuse a psychological warfare campaign — in which you imply that the enemy is always in danger and should evacuate their posts, in an attempt to lower morale and decrease productivity — with a genuine desire to save civilian lives.
The US did engage in various forms of psychological warfare that were meant to look like "warnings" for conventional bombings, but they were also not actionable (they were meant to reduce morale and perhaps encourage abandonment of jobs, but were not really designed to save lives).
This was deliberate — it was felt that a warning would lessen the psychological effect of the bombing, and would endanger the missions themselves (i.e., would make it possible for the Japanese to try and shoot down the planes carrying the bombs).
The US did not warn Japan in any meaningful (or actionable) way that they would use an atomic bomb, nor did they make any effort to warn the populations of the target cities about their impending destruction.
By no means can the US be considered as having warned Japan about the atomic bombs, and by no means can it be considered having warned the targets of the atomic bombings of their predicament. Their lack of warning was deliberate, as they did not want to endanger the success of the mission, they did wanted maximum shock value, and because, for better or worse, they wanted as much destruction as possible, to showcase the spectacular nature of the weapon, both for its effects on Japan's resolve to wage war, and for its impact on the broader world.
