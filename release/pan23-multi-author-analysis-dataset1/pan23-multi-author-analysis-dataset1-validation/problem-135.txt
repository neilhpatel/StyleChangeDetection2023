In a small village in Britanny, I've seen a church with an engraved stele in front of it. No idea how old the stele is, the church itself is 19th century, but the stone probably came later.
The way he recounted it, he claimed the victims were overreacting and then laughed at the NBI's attempts to apprehend him, he also claims that the media was half right about being sent out of country, since Cardinal Vidal(which was, mind you, the most prominent Archdiocese in Philippines) had him sent to Italy for 6 months until the investigations died down, and since he was the Cardinal's favorite, he even got a car from him when he got back from Italy. He bragged even further that as long as the Cardinal was still alive, he was never going to be arrested. It was pretty much just like that one scene from the Big Short with the two realtors.
Impossible. What would they need the church for in this laise-fair world? The power of the Catholic church stems from the fact that they historically were considered the only valid middle man between people and their god.
Seriously. These are the same people that genuinely believe that there is no morality without God. Empathy doesn't exist for them, only fear of punishment.
