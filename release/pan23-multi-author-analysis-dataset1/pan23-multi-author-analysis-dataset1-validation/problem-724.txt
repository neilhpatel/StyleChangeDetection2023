At the end of the war, the Pentagon listed fewer than 800 soldiers as either prisoners or missing in action. After the war, the Pentagon added to the list servicemen considered killed in action but whose bodies were never recovered. Many of these were Air Force pilots: 81 percent of those classified as MIAs were pilots, many of whom failed to eject from their planes before crashing in the Vietnamese jungle. (Since 1975 the Vietnamese have returned the remains of nearly 150 MIAs.).
I absolutely do not doubt that there was a culture of secrecy and cover-ups involving dubious American adventurism in South East Asia at the time, but the specific claim that the USSR transferred American POWs into their jurisdiction, and that these POWs were as a matter of policy disowned by the government, isn't evidenced by anything other than anecdotal accounts or conjecture.
Yes. The Senate Committee on POW-MIA Affairs investigated, which in turn led to the creation of the U.S.â€“Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, which is still active, although it's unclear how much work they've actually been doing in recent years. The U.S. side of the investigation was conducted by the DoD Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, which never found any credible evidence of U.S. service members from Vietnam being held in the Soviet Union.
Thanks for a great post. I believe also there is an aspect of the fueling this as well, the feeling that Vietnam vets were screwed over and disrespected during the war and continue to be screwed over and disrespected to this day.
