Also germany: Cost of living exploding over the last 10 years (especially housing). Wages stagnating.
Especially since the labor shortages are so bad currently because during the height of the corona crisis instead of using the for the crisis easy to use "Kurzarbeit" (I don't know the english term, it's when you can reduce the weekly hours but the employee gets part of the lost money from the state) and instead fired absolutely everybody that wasn't needed to keep the company going while there was very reduced business and now that the market is growing again the applicant market is extremely low because - surprise - every company now realizes that they will need the people they fired again when they want to do the work they did pre Corona.
Yes. They may not all be unemployed. Some may be starting their own businesses, or some may choose to do nothing and live a life with the bare minimum (like the lay flat movement in China for example). Some may turn to crime.
Companies raise their prices every year because of inflation but have let the wages stagnate because "Some people in the team work here for 10 years and they still only make the money they got back then so I can't hire new people for more" and then act like them not finding employees is because nowadays people are lazy or demand unreasonable things like not having to work 10-20 hours unpaid overtime a month or expecting more money than the absolute minimum needed to live.
Yeah. Fuck having enough room to breath. Fuck green spaces. Fuck our ability to grow food. Fuck our overstretched infrastructure. Fuck nature that is literally collapsing. Just build more houses for more immigration.
But yeah you can't expect more foresight than to the end of the next business quarter because if companies wouldn't focus 100% on the short term and instead think about what a smart move for more than the next few months would be how could shareholders live with making 5% less this business year. Wait until that pays off next year? Preposterous! /s.
I think the main point I wanted to make was that people who are frustrated with the salaries being offered are finding other ways of making money that don't depend on those corporations that pay shit wages.
