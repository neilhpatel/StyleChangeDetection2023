Your best course of action is to consult a local real estate attorney who can advise you on the laws in your area and how long your neighbors would need to show they have been using your property before the arrangement or possession is considered permanent.

You don't own the water in the lake, but you do have rights to the bottomlands (drawn using by extending all property lines to the center of the lake), if their dock crosses over the property line that's extended into the water it's on your property.
"riparian property owners generally have the right to install a dock... on their bottomlands... With most inland lakes in Michigan, the bottomlands of a riparian property extend under the water to the center of the lake.".
A key part of it is that the possessors use of the property must be obvious, and that the owner can contest their possession during that 15 year time frame just as you would for anyone on your property without your permission. It's only after that 15 years of ignorance that the possessor can attempt to make a claim.
