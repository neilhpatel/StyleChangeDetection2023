If you are ever going to drive the car, you need to be on the insurance. If you are the registered owner, you need to have insurance that covers you, both for practical insurance reasons and to comply with the mandatory auto insurance laws, and to satisfy the lender's need to have the collateral covered by collision and comprehensive insurance.
We live together. We bought a house together. I don’t drive the car he does. The only time I ever went into the dealership was to co-sign so that he could get the car. Neither of us mind paying the tickets. It’s just that if another ticket gets issued and it’s in my name again it’ll be on my record is what I’m afraid of. I looked up after I had posted this that Illinois is a 3 convictions and you’re out a license type of deal. If I lose my license I will lose my job. And we can’t afford for me to lose my job as I am the main earning person in the household. It was in the winter that we bought the car and I know when they put on the plates to the vehicle is was rushed. I was never handed any paperwork to keep, and from what my boyfriend has all they gave him was a copy of the purchase agreement and power of attorney. And yes the tickets were for speeding. Is there any chance of the tickets being corrected before being paid? Otherwise isn’t paying them is like admitting guilt to the crime?
