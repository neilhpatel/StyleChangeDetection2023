Seems plausible. Weird how Trump wants a loser. Thought it was initially gonna be Noem until Noem flat out said "Trump won't give us our best chance to win". Might be Stefanik since she gave up her leadership position and is close with Trump but not much geographical diversity with two New Yorkers on the ticket. Doesn't make much sense to me. Kim Reynolds doesn't seem to be sufficiently pro-Trump in general. Tulsi is unpopular, but there are people on the right who love her though evangelicals might not like her former history of being pro-choice. Though now she suddenly is fine with Roe V Wade being overturned. So that's a possibility especially since Bannon is a massive fan.

Hmmmm….. I never thought about Tulsi until you brought it up. Jordan and Andrew better clear up their schedules, cause it’s going to be wilder than we all thought it would be, what about Elise?
