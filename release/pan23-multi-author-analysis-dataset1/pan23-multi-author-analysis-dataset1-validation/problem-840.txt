I will clarify to you that I am a 7020 All Lines licensed Adjuster. I currently work in homeowners insurance, but have worked most of my career in auto. I do NOT have a producers license so I cannot know for sure what your agency or Underwriting will do. If they moved your vehicle to a shop for storage or have previously covered the work, you need to consider a term called "Detrimental Reliance". The other term you should look up and become familiar with is "Estopple". Further, your father is correct. This is your vehicle and they cannot tow it until you sign off. They can however, give you a cut off date of which they will stop paying for storage and this must be done in writing.
Failure to cooperate with an investigation and concealing material information is grounds to Deny coverage. If they fail to provide a recorded interview they could be requested to provide a statement under oath which is generally a far more intensive process.
Relax. They aren't supposed to look for loop holes to screw you out. The Government is kinda on them to insure and payout to keep these things out of court.
