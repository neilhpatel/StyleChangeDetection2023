No the eviction court order was just a cancelation of residency, they are now directly suing me for months of rent after the eviction. Claiming non-payment of rent was the reason for the eviction, rather then the incident that happened. I hope this makes sense please comment if not.
Your testimony will be evidence but you should bring as much other evidence as possible including (1) the original lease, (2) the notice your landlord gave you to leave, (3) anything you may have that says you returned the keys, (4) proof that you paid rent (bank statements, cashed checks, receipts etc), (5) a list of deductions from your security deposit given by your landlord when you moved out.
Here is my guess as to what happened. You were served a 30-day notice of non-renewal from the landlord. This is NOT an eviction, which is a court process. You were mad that you got notice to move, so you stopped paying rent and turned in keys. You still owe rent through this notice period though , and your landlord can sue you for it.
Were you in the middle of the lease when you were given notice, or were you on a month-to-month agreement?
