They haven't lost their mind. They have decided to be tabloid politicians. You know, like tabloids that publish made-up stories and sensationalize regular news to outrage their readers and entice them to buy more of their fake stories. These election losers are the political equivalent of tabloids, making up stories and sensationalizing non-events to aggravate their followers into wanting more and more outrage. Not insane. Just tabloid politicians. It pays the bills, I guess.
You would think after 3 consecutive general elections where they have lost and lost and lost again (2018 house, 2020 senate/presidency/Arizona -2 senators/Georgia -2 senators), and then barely eeked out a mid-term win, but lost State Legislatures, Governorships, AG's, & Senators etc. in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania & Georgia.
Huh? It was a BS complaint. They are mad because they can't claim our elections are run by foreign entities on Twitter.
