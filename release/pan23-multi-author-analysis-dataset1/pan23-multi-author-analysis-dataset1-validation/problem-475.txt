The next big glider assault was in Normandy in June 1944. Shortly after midnight on the 6th, a reinforced company from 2nd Battalion Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Regiment landed around two strategic bridges (one over the Orne River and one over the Caen Canal), quickly securing them. Three more gliders were used to bolster the assault on the Merville battery, though this was less successful, with only one reaching the target successfully. These gains were reinforced by paratroopers dropped during the night. Shortly before dawn, more gliders landed around Ranville to further expand and reinforce the airhead. Finally, during the evening of the 6th, a large glider lift carried in more troops, as well as engineers, artillery and anti-tank guns, and the light tanks of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment.
He was British. I thought it was weird that they said only one out of seven went behind enemy lines, but I had only known the man for 5 years before his passing so I wasnt about to question his nephews recollection of the matter. And as for when, i couldnt even guess. He passed away at 95 and it was days after his 21st birthday that the mission took place. I'll look into it thouvh.
Most of the gliders involved in the operation were damaged by flak, so most of the losses were from relatively survivable crashes on landing - only 10 of the 80 British gliders lost were destroyed in the air, rather than on the ground. Still, an impressive survival, as casualties in the airborne units were considerably higher than in the units that crossed the Rhine in boats and by bridges.
