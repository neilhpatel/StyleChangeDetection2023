Good posts, I will give them a read. One thing to add is that he said the N word in a speech and that made me feel uncomfortable. I'm glad i read his book tho as I wasn't passive, I did stay sceptical and didn't believe things at face value. Cheers all.
Hitchens view was fairly widespread before the trial (I remember the debate at my own university when a student society invited him in the early 1990s) but is unsustainable after it. Irving was never a free speech hero, that is where Hitchens was profoundly wrong. His books weren’t banned and he spoke and wrote widely. He sued to suppress Lipstadt's criticism of him, not the other way round. Irving had the ability to be a significant historian but chose not to be. If you find a fact or analysis in his work that isn’t anywhere else you can’t know if it is genuine. If the fact or analysis is not unique you don’t need Irving. We are dealing with one of the most researched subjects on earth with a huge range of views and controversies. Irving made a living playing up the idea that he was a maverick challenging consensus but that is a straw man.
