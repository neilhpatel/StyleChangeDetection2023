Surely there is damage to his car that will need repair, but in some jurisdictions there is also the question of (1) who pays for him to have a rental car while his car is in the shop, (2) if he is sore after the crash -- it's common to feel OK immediately after a crash before there has been time for the swelling to manifest and while the adrenaline is at its highest levels but for the injuries to become more apparent days after the crash -- who pays to have his medical condition evaluated, (3) if he misses work to have his car repaired and his medical condition evaluated or for physical therapy if that is prescribed who pays for that lost time, and (4) who pays compensation for the pain from the injuries, etc.
Ah I see. Thank you very much for your advice. Only one part of the car was damaged though, and the amount I sent him is more than enough so surely it would be difficult for him to squeeze more money as there was no more damage to the vehicle.
