Well first you had to pass, and pass brilliantly. After that, your day-to-day life would have been very different based upon your posting. I'm not familiar with the Song, but I am much more well-acquainted with the Ming/early Qing. As a low-level civil servant, serving at some magisterial level, you would almost certainly have been bombarded with an endless stream of miscellaneous tasks, ranging from sorting out murders to mediating disputes over filial piety. China has long been blessed and cursed by the Imperial exam system as it created a heavily centralized and culturally homogeneous bureaucracy in a very, very diverse country, but simultaneously ingrained a culture of rule-by-men as opposed to rule by law, and nowhere could this be seen better than down at the lowest levels of the Imperial bureaucracy. There were obviously also other positions you could be placed. The three highest scoring candidates for the Imperial examination (the exam system as a whole is better referred to as the Civil service exams as the Imperial exam was actually a specific level of it) often would receive appointments to the Hanlin Academy to provide discourse on the interpretation of Neo-Confucian and Confucian canons. If you did commendably, you might also be appointed as a tutor, or to the ministry of Rites to aid the court in conducting Rites in accordance with the ideals of Confucianism. In terms of power, it varied directly. Zhang Juzheng was the regent for the Wanli Emperor in the late 16th century when the emperor was yet to come of age, and in that time he wielded considerable power. Granted he wasn't particularly terrible administrator, but he was still able to flex his political muscle and bend the rules of the court to his will, and managed to guide the young emperor into accepting his policies, at least while he lived.
Thanks! That's a very thorough answer to a broad question, and I can't thank you enough for taking the time to answer it. If you're okay with follow ups, I do have a couple of questions:
The actual responsibilities of the Song Chancellor also changed from time to time, such as there being a divide between the chancellor and the head of the Song Treasury(三司使) at the beginning of the Northern Song, but merged roles after Emperor Shenzong thought it was stupid that the government was given such a major separation of power (though the Song encouraged power separations in earnest). In times of great peril, chancellors were also known to become military commanders (some of them being surprisingly competent, given their mostly academic upbringing), though they usually did not have that power. But overall, I would say while there is nothing similar to a modern UK MP, the Song Chancellory does function similarly to the UK Cabinet, though with an absolute monarch making the official decisions. There is almost no range limit on what decisions the Chancellors can discuss and decide on, from diplomatic decisions, establishing new strategies in warfare, to enacting major reforms, and just dealing with the reports sent from everybody down below, Chancellors have the power directly give commands (this power is often under a tug of war between the emperor and the chancellor), but mainly they discuss amongst themselves and with the emperor in cabinet meetings and the emperor calls upon his scribes to write it down to eventual release these documents as decrees of the empire, thus making everything official (of course, low-level orders exist outside of the emperor's oversight, since he can't do EVERYTHING). I disagree with the view that the Chinese are a completely "rule-by-man" system, ancient China has a very extensive written law system, along with extensive traditions, much like the UK. Though it certainly isn't rule of law. The Chancellory can repeatedly block the emperor's attempts at naming his favorites as bureaucrats due to the system design of 门下 department having a rebuking power, and the Song emperors have a major commitment to their family creed, such as not killing any bureaucrats on a whim. I would say the Song definitely have a somewhat professional government, though the ambiguities, and the fact that it isn't rule of law makes it very different from true modern governments.
I would argue that if not considering the modern system and ideology changes, the actual things done by Song bureaucrats would be very similar to the modern day. Handling documents, collecting taxes, surveying fields, supervising on work and so forth. And they were a relatively rich and respected lot in their society, and some government roles were almost designed to give you an easy life and no power at all.
No. They could recommend policies but in general, China functioned like any absolute monarchy would: The emperor made all the big calls, officially. But China also didn't have a tradition of common law, like we do here in the Anglosphere. Certain matters could be decided at the whim of lower ranked officials (like in civil disputes, or rather especially in civil disputes) so in that case, yes, lower ranked officials did influence policies to a certain extent, at least locally. But these sort of 'standards' set by one magistrate or prefect would come and go along with their creators since magistrates were rotated out every couple of years. Also, at these lower levels, everything was done with the agreement of the local scholar-gentry. If a magistrate lost the support of this critical base of local elites, he was absolutely fucked. There isn't really much of a comparison to be drawn between the average late Imperial bureaucrat and an MP.
