Careful now, what your first Sargent could’ve meant was separation due to Anti-Social personality. If mental health diagnoses you with a anti-social disorder or personality you can be discharged without receiving VA benefits. Anti/social personality/disorder is not a condition that the VA or military considers a disability.
You have no standing on suing the military. I can absolutely guarantee that whoever decided your characterization of service (the board members or commanding general) did so after thoroughly considering your rank, time in service, proficiency and conduct during service, and meritorious service, if any.
I’m not leaving anything out, the paperwork doesn’t mention mental health. I was separated for administrative reasons. However my first sergeant slipped and said “mental health would’ve separated you anyways”, admitting that was a factor.
They considered mental health as a factor, saying I was going to be separated anyways. But they didn’t put it on paperwork because then they’d have to give me a straight honorable.
