Ya think? That would be so stupid simple but we are dealing with the goobermint. Cannabis is just a pawn. Something to get people fired up about. But fortunately for cannabis, it is now attached to a lot of economic stimulus so Repubs will cave. Money is at the core and the fear mongering will just go away. They don’t actually care about cannabis. They aren’t Christian puritans. Once there is money to be had, they will always relinquish their previous platforms built on doom and the Devil. They just manipulate “Christians” until they can find the next thing to fear monger about. That’s their platform. Abortion is the distraction moral high ground while cannabis has them salivating at the chops.
