Given that it is now that month of the year when corporations decide to market rainbow coloured coffee mugs etc. in an effort to appeal to LGBT folks, I thought it would be interesting to have a look at how medieval society handled those with sexual preferences or gender identities that would be described as LGBT+ today. While it would be easy to just rattle off some examples of historical figures, it would be more informative to dive into some of the sources we have to work with and what they tell us. So, every Saturday of the month, that's what I'm going to do.
relative degree of tolerance towards Christianity. Certainly, in the context of the Crusades, there was animosity, but tolerance was certainly present. At the time of Symon’s visit, a number of churches and chapels were open. This included those of the Syriac Coptic Church which Symon noted continued to perform mass bilingually. Indeed, the legal administration of the Mamluks had rejected calls from scholars such as Najm al-Din Ibn al-Rif to shutdown Christian churches. Records surviving in the Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai give us details about tax emptions and protections given to the monastery by various Mamluk authorities, including Sultans. One of these includes one issued by al-Nasir Muhammad to support the monastery against bandits. Though on a number of instances Franciscans were killed in the prior decades, and that the Syriac church had been persecuted, the conditions were not at all entirely prohibitive to pilgrims, especially if they could secure the right connections, and even monasteries had received protective privileges.

Hence, the doctrine that evolved as a result of acquiring new implements, using them in his army and adopting to a more combined arms approach rather than simply cavalry, was as follows : The Mughal commander (usually the Emperor) would sieze the strategic and operational offensive, using his light Central Asian cavalry to scout ahead into enemy territory, making sure engagements took place on enemy terrain, and picked out a suitable venue for the battle, preferably one which allowed him to anchor his flank to a natural barrier such as a lake, a river or thick forest or hills. Once selected the light cavalry screening force would cover the advance of the main force which would make arrangements so the ground would be used to sieze the tactical defensive and the forces would be arranged into the wagon fort formation with the cavalry prepared to execute the tulugma or encirclement maneuvers. This made a frontal approach by any enemy suicidal, exposing him to tremendous firepower from guns, cannons and arrows. An enemy attempting to flank, would be forced to contend with light cavalry armed with composite bows, supported in the rear with heavy cavalry, meaning the light cavalry would evade the attackers and make way for heavy cavalry, which would destroy the cavalry of the enemy with support from horse archers encircling them.

To understand the history of Mughal foreign relations with neighbouring states in Iran and Central Asia, we must go back to the founder of the Mughal dynasty and his immediate successor, since it was the experiences of these men, with both the aforementioned states that truly shaped the outlook and policy of later Mughals upto Aurangzeb.

The above innovations and doctrines adopted by the Mughals meant that by 1590 or 1600, the Mughal Army commanded such a superior position on the battlefield in terms of firepower, that they rendered compact or linear formations obsolete. Not simply in terms of gunpowder weapons, but also in terms of traditional weapons (bow and arrow) the firepower of a Mughal wagon fort formation was tremendous. A formations of enemy infantry or cavalry would be riddled with hails of arrows, accurate and heavy musket ball fire, and the fire from rockets, swivel guns, and camel guns, before finally receiving volleys from the many and varied yet deadly Mughal cannons. As mentioned already, the wagon fort of the Mughals made a frontal attack suicidal and flanking would still be prone to fire from the centre and ultimately, there were few options for compact infantry formations against horse archers, who could simply shoot them from a distance and thin their ranks, creating an opening for heavy cavalry.
