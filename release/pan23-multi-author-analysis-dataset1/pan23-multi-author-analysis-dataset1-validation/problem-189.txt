Sorry but no, your LL is lying to you. You will sue him in Civil Court, and very quickly get awarded your money.
Yea because there is a distinct difference between a management company simply managing a property and a management company owning and operating one. In this case the managemt company was simply managing it. So all accounts are ultimately controlled by the owner. The owner usually allows the company to make decisions for him but it’s still on the owner at the end of the day. So the security deposit is held by the owner despite management companies managing the accounts.
1. Check your records to be sure you have proof that you paid the security deposit. Place it in a fire/water proof case.
In the jurisdiction I used to practice in (not yours), there were severe penalties for a landlord who failed to provide an accounting of the security deposit within a certain time frame after move out, and that also applied when a landlord inappropriately withheld part or all of a security deposit. It sounds like that is likely to occur here. Additionally, the jurisdiction I practiced in allowed for reimbursement of attorney fees when you won. This sounds like a strong candidate to discuss with a local attorney, as you may be able to be entitled to attorney reimbursement along with your security deposit, as well as potential damages related to a late return of your deposit.
No it is not. For example I work at a property that has 3 different leases currently running together with different stipulation because 3 different management companies have managed it within the last year. When those older leases expire they will be renewed on the newer leases but we don’t cancel all leases the day a new company takes over. Can you imagine a 300+ unit property canceling all leases simply because the owner changed management companies? That would be an absolute mess. Leases are legal documents that don’t just get voided because a change in management.
