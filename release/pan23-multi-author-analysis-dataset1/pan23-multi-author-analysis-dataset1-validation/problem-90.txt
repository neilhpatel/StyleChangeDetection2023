NAL, but I have had two CT scans recently, one with dye and one without. The thing he told her about feeling the need to pee when the dye is injected is true, but he absolutely should NOT have touched her there. Lifting her shirt was unnecessary, moving her arm to inject the dye was unnecessary, touching her vagina was unnecessary. I can confirm these are all huge violations. I am sorry her experience was so traumatic. Please report to the police.
Itâ€™s uncertain if the hospital has any obligations besides possible internal investigations and thise results can range anywhere from nothing to terminating an employee.
NAL. Ex med tech here. What happened was an absolute violation. Write down the names and departments of staff she reported this to. If they're not doing all they can to ensure this predator doesn't hurt anyone else, they need to be held responsible. Everyone has great advice, file a police report, the hospital isn't going to do anything but keep it as quiet and "in-house" as possible. I just wanted to say that going forward, if it would help, every time your wife makes a healthcare appointment she can request a female chaperone be present for it. She shouldn't have been put in this position and if anyone gets huffy, she can inform them of her history of assault by medical personnel.
