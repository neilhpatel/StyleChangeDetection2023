Specifically about World War II. To paraphrase Richard Overy in Why The Allies Won, we can't just assume that any outcome was "inevitable", especially when comparing raw numbers of the countries involved, as how these numbers actually translated into victory involved important differences in organizational capacity, technical achievement, leadership and fighting skills, and the balances on these fronts did change back and forth over the war.
Thanks for the additional resources! I am familiar with such an argument and largely agree that failure to reform agriculture and food production was a long-standing issue in the USSR that helped lead to its collapse, coupled with increasing difficulty getting funds. However I would argue that these are issues that fall under the umbrella of a stagnating economy and that these issues could have been resolved with reforms. Ultimately I would argue (I'm not an economist mind-you) that their agricultural stagnation and waffling income from oil stemmed from their failure to reform and adapt and that those would constitute factors I sort of boiled down into "stagnation". But the additional details are always appreciated.
Now, of course it didn't turn out this way. But Dupuy's point is that at the start of January 1944, an Allied military victory didn't necessarily seem an inevitable matter of months away. The territory and population Germany controlled in Europe was still of German leaders in the First World War. German and Japanese armaments production figures would actually be at their highest levels in 1944. Both Axis powers proved themselves capable of still launching military offensives in 1944, in Japan's case this including an attempted invasion of Northeast India and a mostly successful offensive capturing and holding territory and US airfields in southeastern China.
