According to Jim Bendat's Democracy's Big Day: The Inauguration of our President, 1789-2013, the delay between being elected and being inaugurated was mostly because of travel time.
Per Bendat's interview with , (Inauguration Day: Why Presidents Wait 2 Months to Start, Kacey Deamer, January 19 2017) "'There was a debate on when to change it, because it was decided pretty universally that four months was too long to wait," Bendat said. "The Senate originally wanted to change it to Jan. 15, and the House of Representatives suggested Jan. 24, and Jan. 20 was reached as a compromise.'".
Besides the reasons mentioned involving travel (which are generally considered the main ones), the fact that many of the Founders expected most Presidential elections to not produce a majority () did play a role in this as well, since it was somewhat expected that it would take time to resolve numerous elections in the House. And indeed, in 1800 and 1876 Congress nearly reached the constitutionally mandated end of term before resolving the elections - which would have created an even more massive headache if they hadn't, as then Congress also had to designate succession rules for who would be acting as President while passing the selection on to the next Congress. One scholar, Bruce Ackerman, points out this latter scenario - which was a distinct possibility in 1800 - could have easily caused the breakdown of the entire system (complete with partisan militias marching on Washinon to overthrow the government) if a Federalist - most likely John Marshall - had been appointed as Acting President by the Federalist controlled Senate while the Republicans who'd won the election had to wait another 8 months to convene a new Congress.
I agree with you there. Presiding from anywhere could be possible, but just look at how long it took to shorten it the first time -- it's not likely to change because it's "tradition," for lack of a better word. Nobody thinks about it, so it remains. However this year just might rouse a discussion.
