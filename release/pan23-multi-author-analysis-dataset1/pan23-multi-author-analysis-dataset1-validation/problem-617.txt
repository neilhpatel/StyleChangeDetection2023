What changed in the 14th century was the development of much more tactically aggressive, well armed infantry in areas such as Flanders and Scotland and the English and French reaction to these changes. The Scottish, for instance, developed from the static schiltron of William Wallace that was shot to pieces at Falkirk to the aggressive schiltrons of Robert the Bruce that charged the English at Bannockburn. In Flanders, more frequent revolts by the towns against their count and the king of France resulted in armies that were mostly infantry and which made up for their lack by using man-made or natural barriers and aggressively advancing when the French were disrupted by these or, as at Mons-en-Pévèle, the French had given up the attack and retired for the day.
This is something that we've got very little evidence for. I'm less aware of continental evidence so I'll stick to England and Wales in the 15th century if that's all right, given that that seems to be the period you're referring to. Documents related to indentures and musters tell us how soldiers were equipped, but not how they fought. Chronicles from the period can give us a good idea of strategy but are less useful when it comes to tactics. They do nonetheless differentiate between cavalry, infantry and archers. The latter would make up the bulk of a typical army, though of course they would carry effective melee weapons as well, and wear some armour. Edward Hall's later chronicle describes how the Lancastrian archers fell back after losing the archery duel at the Battle of Towton, implying that more heavily armoured men would lead the infantry assault. This of course, make perfect sense, as those men would be best protected against the enemy's arrows.
