In the states that do have Death with Dignity legislation, to my knowledge they mostly revolve around the idea of a physician-assisted death for terminal patients who have an estimated relatively short period to live. Your situation would not meet that criteria, as these states would not consider a progressive mental decline in cognition to be a terminal illness. Even in Canada, where they have legalized direct euthanasia by physicians for terminally ill patients, they specifically do not allow patients to give consent to "die later" at the hands of a caregiver or physician due to concerns over dementia or Alzheimer's disease. I'll note, dementia or Alzheimer's may be used as a legal means to physician assisted death in the Netherlands though. Some of the death with dignity legislation in the US is very new so who knows what the next few decades will bring in terms of more progressive views on physician assisted death, or even medical advancements in treating/preventing these diseases.
Unfortunately not. That is probably the situation it would MOST make sense to want to die but it doesn't work legally with jurisdictions where assisted suicide is allowed. It may in the future.
The standardized forms are specifically designed and sanctioned by states to make a healthcare directive a routine DIY task; it took a lawyer prior to the standardized forms, but that is no longer really a necessity. One can certainly choose to use one, but the legalese has already been written.
