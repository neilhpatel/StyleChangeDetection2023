If you're in the US, this is a medical issue. Short term disability plans cover you while you are disabled. "Disabled" is determined due to your medical condition, not by how much time you would like to take off work. So until you actually have the baby, there is no way to know how long your doctor in conjuction with the insurance plan will determine you are "disabled." The 13 weeks isn't saying you can get 13 weeks off work paid, it's just a cap meaning that the plan will pay as long as you are disabled and if that disability lasts for longer than 13 weeks, it's no longer considered short term so not covered under this plan.
Yes it can! Unfortunately I work for an extremely small company with no HR department (I know it sounds crazy). I’m in upper management and we all just kind of tackle these things together. I had to contact our benefits specialist because no one knew exactly what our plan was. Our benefit specialist wasn’t even entirely sure so I appreciate all the information. Also congrats .
