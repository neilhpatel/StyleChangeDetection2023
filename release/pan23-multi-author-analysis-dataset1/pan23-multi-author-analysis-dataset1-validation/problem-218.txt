If you are convicted of a drug-related offense after you submit the FAFSA form, you might lose eligibility for federal student aid, and you might be liable for returning any financial aid you received during a period of ineligibility.
So in other words, yes. Over a little pot. He could face probation, a fine, even time in a juvenile facility. The US system is not kind to drug offenses. It is extremely serious.
If your eligibility for federal student aid has been suspended due to a drug conviction, you can regain eligibility early by successfully completing an approved drug rehabilitation program or by passing two unannounced drug tests administered by an approved drug rehabilitation program. If you regain eligibility during the award year, notify your financial aid office immediately so you can get any aid youâ€™re eligible for.
No, you should not. Don't speak to ANYONE without an attorney. It seems like such a small deal because it's 2 grams and it's just pot, and I'm over here in California and I can, and do, use as much as I want, but Wisconsin's a different world.
