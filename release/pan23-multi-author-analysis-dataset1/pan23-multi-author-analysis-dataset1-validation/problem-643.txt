I would even argue that this entire strategy is a sign that there is a lack of precision weapons or at least the capability to effectively use them. Simply put, these strikes are a waste. They do not advance Russia's war goals. Knocking out electrical grids for hours or days isn't going to massively hamper Ukraine's ability to fight this war, it isn't going to impact their ability to supply their troops either. So why do it? Why not use these weapons to bomb strategic targets like ammo dumps, hangars, or unit headquarters, or hell even just tactical targets of opportunity. The two most likely explanations are either they don't have enough weapons to actually make an impact with this strategy or they lack the intelligence capabilities to target anything that isn't nailed down. Now Russia isn't blind, they have satellites. So you'd think they'd occasionally get lucky, spot something worth blowing up and launch a stroke. But as far as I can tell, they don't.
Edit: yes I know the frog metaphor is bacward, the point IS that a frog jumps out of water as the water gradually heats up (russia get exhausted and pulls out of ukraine as more support for ukraine gradually comes in from the west), and a frog dies if put in boiling water (russia pushes the nuke button if we send all we got at once).
I’m fully aware. Just pointing out that I’ve been reading misinformation on this site for quite some time. They’re down to T62 tanks if you want to believe some things we read.
