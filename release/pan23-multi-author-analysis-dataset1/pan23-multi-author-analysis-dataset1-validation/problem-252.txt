I mean to be fair, it depends. Grew up and lived in the Bay Area for 30 plus years. Still live near a major fault line in Northern California. Anything below a 5 and a lot of people I know literally never notice. 5 something, it depends where it is. 5.1-5.4 is a maybe. Obviously depends how close or far away it is. 5.5+, and especially 6+, yeah those are for sure going to be felt.
Not saying this is related to this particular case, but climate change — melting polar ice, to be specific — has most likely an influence on volcanic and tectonic activities, due to all the redistributed pressure (high pressure from two points eases and the weight is evenly distributed when entering the sea).
No. That's the speed of the tsunami out at sea where it's height is only a few feet or even inches and it's wavelenh is dozens or hundreds of miles.
At shore it's compressed, slows, down, and grows in height as that wave that used to be a few inches tall but hundreds of miles long is now 1/100th the width, but 100x the height.
