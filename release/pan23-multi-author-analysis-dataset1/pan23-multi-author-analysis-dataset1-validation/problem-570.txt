I didn't knew the Greeks from Homer's time did identify this site as Troy. I thought this identification was from the Roman period. Do you know what are the elements which show that the Greeks from Homer's time did see Hisarlik's site as Troy? I'll certainly get a look at the book you mentionned. Thanks!
As for guarantees that that site is the city they were thinking of ... well, in the first place, there's the archaeology showing a sizeable Hellenistic and Roman-era city there, and the only other cities in the immediate vicinity were Abydos and Alexandria Troias, and they're in separate known locations on the coast; there are inscriptions referring to 'the demos of the Ilians', Ilian Athena, and so on; there are coins from there showing Ilian Athena; Strabo talks about the geography of the Troad (he uses 'Troy' for the region, and 'Ilium' for the city); it pops up in any number of places. Constantine considered it as a potential site for his eastern capital city, people like Xerxes and Alexander visited, a rogue Roman commander attacked it at one point, and so on and so on. It's not an obscure thing. It was a major tourist site from the time of Xerxes up to the 1400s: you could visit and tour guides would show you the supposed burial mounds of the heroes.
