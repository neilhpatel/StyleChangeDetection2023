Luckily people with way more expertise than you studied this and determined the Bradfield plan was an unworkable fantasy. It's been debunked many times since it was proposed in 1938.
The Kimberley in particular has an oddly low annual rainfall range despite being in the tropical north with areas close by that have vastly different annual rainfall ranges - eg, Fitzroy Crossing has an annual rainfall of \400mm, Broome is \600mm & Darwin \1700mm.
Yup. Knowing that we are doomed as a species makes me lose sympathy with those that denied and hindered needed change. Knowing that some countries will be Hit earlier and harder maybe making them at least realize what they have done is quite Easing. Call it reliefing if you want, im not a native speaker.
Some of the problems include the extreme cost, the extraordinary evaporation rates that occur in tropical latitude arid zones ( which has rendered other top end irrigation projects like the Ord River project far less effective than planned),and the poor, thin soils in central Australia due to it being the oldest continent on the planet. And finally, despite it being arid, it is rich with local wildlife.
