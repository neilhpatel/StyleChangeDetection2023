As OP wonders, saltpeter and sulphur, especially the former, were not so common to find and to get easily especially in Europe. While some natural saltpeter deposits are available on earth, though mainly to be dug up, at least in tropic zones (see above in Cortés' letter), they were not so abundant in Europe, so they had to 'produce' the saltpeter or to import them from somewhere once the use of firearm weapons got popular in the end of the Middle Ages.
Cut the wood for charcoal at about one foot. Make sure you remove the bark. Remove the inner core, then dry the wood for a day. Since the sun of the summer is strong, it should dry out well in about ten, fourteen, or fifteen days. However, if you dry the wood in excess of twenty days, then you should dry it in the shade. Next is the roasting of the wood.
As you may know, Toshio KAGE, together with Shinji YAMAUCHI (who I already mentioned, originally an expert on Song-Japanese trade), is the leading expert on this field of research (Japan's sulphur trade in maritime Asia, mainly based on the documentary evidence on Clan Ōtomo), and he has just edited and published new essay collection, titled as Muromachi and Sengoku Periods seen from Sulphur and Silver in this month (sorry that the linked book data is entirely in Japanese):
Dig a hole about two feet deep. Cut about five inches of straw and lay it down on the bottom. Pack the wood on top of the straw. Light it from below and when the wood starts to blaze, apply straw on top of the wood continuously to keep the blaze from dying down. If burnt well, smoke should not rise from the bottom. When the smoke does not rise in that manner, flip over a bucket and using it as a lid, steam the wood pieces.
Under no circumstances should you have open flames at the site producing the powder. If a fire breaks out, immediately a disaster will arise. Even when igniting the powder to test it, have no other powder nearby. It should be stored away separately. Fire can ignite powder even at a distance of two to three yards. There must be no negligence.
On the other hand, very few study have explored so far on the development of late medieval and early modern sulphur trade, at least in Western Eurasia including Europe (AFAIK Mehler 2015 is almost only one dedicated work on for medieval trade of sulphur). The possible reasons were at least twofold: The improved mix ratio of raw ingredient with higher explosive force required more saltpeter, but less sulphur. smaller scale of sulphur mines were known here and there also in European Continent: To give an example, Pirotechnia by Sienese Vanoccio Biringucchio (1540), one of the oldest 'written' detailed treatises of gunpowder and its use in Early Modern Europe, makes a note that sulphur are found in some [volcanic] areas like Aeolian Islands, Mt. Etna in Sicily, and Pozzuoli (also famous for the spa since the Middle Ages) (Chapter 2, in: Smith & Gnudi trans. 1959: 86):
by [Japanese] barbarians are ingenious. Considering that saltpeter is only produced in China, if the ban on it is tightened, preventing people from going overseas to communicate with them secretly and supplying them[with saltpeter], then they [the Japanese] will lose their support, and it will be easy to capture them.

Further in my investigations I found criminals from Tong’an, Haicheng, Longxi, Zhangpu, Zhaoan [in Fujian], and elsewhere obtained trading licenses in the fourth or fifth month of every year, claiming that they were taking cargo to Funing, or going to Beigang to fish, or trading to Jilong and Danshui [in Taiwan]. They often illegally carried lead and saltpeter, secretly heading for Japan. They returned in fall and winter, or in the next spring. Others pretended to go to Chaozhou, Huizhou, Guangzhou and Gaozhou in Guangdong province to purchase grain, but actually sailed across the sea to Japan.
