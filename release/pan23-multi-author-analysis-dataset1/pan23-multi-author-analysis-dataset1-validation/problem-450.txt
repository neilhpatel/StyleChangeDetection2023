As to your roof, the short answer is that you’re going to have to replace it yourself. The question is whether the sellers (or their contractor) would be on the hook. It seems like somebody screwed up in a way that made you replace the roof much sooner than you should have. I’d probably reach out to a real estate litigator for advice, but offhand I’d imagine the plan would be to contact the sellers and politely find out what the story is about why the documentation they gave you turned out to be false. If they pass the blame onto the contractor, find out who that is, and then you and your attorney would decide whether to sue (or hopefully resolve by threatening to sue) the sellers, the contractor, or both. Good luck!
Question: would you be able to get paperwork from the company the did the roof replacement to confirms if they were ordered to do the double layer (and you were given false documents) or of they just charged the double layer even though they were ordered to remove the roof?
IANAL. If you can prove that the sellers knew the documentation was fake then you may have recourse against them.
