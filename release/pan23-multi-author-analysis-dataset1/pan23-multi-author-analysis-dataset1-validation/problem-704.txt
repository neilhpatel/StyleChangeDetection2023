3. I haven't had close/intimate contact with XBF in almost 3 and a half YEARS, and no sexual intercourse in well over FOUR, closer to 4 and a half! So how could I get covid from him anyway??
I will say this. In a fairness, we did argue back and forth for a good two months or so after he dumped me for what turned out to be complete deceptive hypocrisy. He would instigate me with some degrading or belittling text, and I admit I felt the need to finally defend myself to him after all the times in the months we dated that I never truly expressed how I felt or stood up to him when he was rude or two-faced. He never said to stop or that he would be calling the cops...not until I showed him that he was posted under a list of cheaters, that is. When I first told him about it, before I actually submitted the cheaters info on him, he literally laughed and said to go ahead and write about him, because it would have no effect on him. A few days later when he suddenly told me to stop contacting him (all I was doing was explaining myself in response to him sending me yet another degrading text earlier that same day), he claimed that he's sick of him and his GIRLFRIEND (the FWB who he met at the outdoor bar 2mos earlier and stood me up to go fk! ðŸ¤¬) getting "woken up" from my "late nite" texts. Which is a load of bull, because I always knew him to stay up late, til 1 or 2am each night. I responded the next morning only to call him on his bullshit, tell him I don't appreciate being gaslighted like that, and then a "oh by the way, check out this link" connected to the blogsite where I submitted my "don't date this cheater" post. My post was insulting but nothing close to the text OR photo content he put about me. At THAT point, he texted back angrily, falsely claiming that he had already talked to the police about my blog post (only 10mins later?) and that they strongly advised him to get a lawyer and take me to court. I then told him that he did a lot worse to ME and had contacted me many more times after our breakup than I ever did him. I never contacted him after that. Here I thought he stopped texting because he learned his lesson when he saw what I anonynously wrote about him. Instead, it seems he disconnected/changed his number immediately after writing and publishing MUCH worse content about me.
No. Just telling people your state or country will not identify you, but it is the only way that people can give you legal advice that will be relevant to you. It is a rule that you must post your location.
