Both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament texts are very important sources for historical research; however, it is not as straightforward as, say, the book of Kings being a historically accurate source for the history of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. It is important to recognize first of all that none of the texts in the Bible were written as straightforward historical records; even books like Kings and Chronicles in the Hebrew Bible and Acts in the New Testament, which on the surface seem like historical accounts, are better understood as historiosophy, stories framed as historical accounts whose primary purpose is to use that "history" to convey theological points. For example, a quick comparison of Paul's travels in the Book of Acts significantly differs from his own account of his doings in his own letters; whereas Paul seems to have a troubled relationship with leaders of the early church in Jerusalem like James and Peter, in Acts their relationship is much less antagonistic, and disagreements between them are resolved without too much drama. Acts also seems to follow a consistent formula whenever Paul and his companions go to a new city to preach the gospel, with Paul going to the synagogue to teach, being rejected by the Jews therein, and then proceeding to preach to the Gentiles, among whom he wins converts. This formula mirrors the overall story of the Gospel of Luke (written by the same author), where Jesus preaches first to the Jews, is rejected and crucified, then after his resurrection commands his followers to preach to the Gentiles, among whom they gain converts. This formula is seen by scholars as an illustration of Luke's central message of proclaiming the gospel to the Gentiles; this is a prime example of historiosophy, where the "historical" account is written in a way that demonstrates the theological message of the author.

Obviously, the primarily theological nature of the Biblical texts means that scholars must be careful not to use them as straightforward history, or as historically accurate accounts of, say, the life of Jesus of Nazareth or the early church. Scholars must often read between the lines of such texts to try to reconstruct what actually happened, and make educated guesses where our information is incomplete. To build on the previous example, most scholars tend to view the account of the early church in the Book of Acts as a whitewashed history, one which tries to smooth out the conflicts between Paul and his Gentile converts and the Jewish disciples in Jerusalem. So it is useful in reconstructing the history of early Christianity, but not because it is itself a historical document, or because it accurately recounts this history.

So to conclude, while the books of the Bible are rarely ever straightforward history, or written with the intention of being historically accurate, they are still incredibly valuable to historians and other scholars. They can still offer important clues, if we read between the lines, about what actually happened in the past, and moreover, they tell us how ancient peoples thought about themselves and their own history at the time they were written.
But I should also mention that the Biblical texts are valuable for historians not necessarily because they tell us what happened in the past, but how people in ancient times INTERPRETED the past. To move to the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament), we can see this clearly in what is known as the Deuteronomistic History. This is a set of books including Joshua, Kings, and Judges that was written by the same author or theological school that wrote the book of Deuteronomy. The Deuteronomistic history presents a history of the Israelites drawn from earlier sources, but reinterprets those sources in a way that validates the theology of the Deuteronomistic school. The central tenet of Deuteronomistic theology was that suffering among the Israelite people was punishment for disobeying God, and for worshipping false idols instead of Yahweh. Throughout the books of Deuteronomistic history, we see this theme repeated, with kings who worshipped idols bringing God's wrath upon themselves or their descendants. So these books are not simply useful to scholars as offering clues as to what happened in the past (even if they are not always accurate); they are valuable also in telling scholars what people believed at the time they were written. Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic History tell us what Israelites at the time of the Babylonian exile were thinking about the nature of God and their own history.
