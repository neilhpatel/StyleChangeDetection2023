It's not a good article because it only focuses on superstition and doesn't give any detail on anything else relating to bee deaths or the factual information in this incident. You can't form an accurate opinion because there is almost no objective information given.
This article isn't unbiased because it focuses too heavily on one aspect. It will either make you side with them by sympathising with their views or think of them as insane. It's not a fair way to present information and give a balanced view.
But large proportions of westerners (especially in the US) will go to church on Sunday, actually believe that there is a supernatural being that is responsible for their fortune and misfortune, and that there is an actual heaven where certain people ascended and where people will go in an afterlife. And will hold the view above about other beliefs being ridiculous, with no irony whatsoever.
