The III and IV would eventually go on to be the backbone of almost all German Panzer divisions, and were extremely good vehicles for the war that Germany WANTED to fight, which was quick, fast wars that relied on speed and maneuverability to outflank and destroy their enemies. After the failure of Operation Barbarossa however, Germany found itself in a completely different kind of fight, a war of attrition. Germany could make a good number of Panzer IV's sure, a respectable 8,500 throughout the war, but when your enemy can make 35,000+ comparable T-34 tanks, Germany's resources shortages are ultimately going to lose the war for them as these tanks cannot be replaced as easily as those from their resource-rich enemies.
The final lesson here is Germany went for quality over quantity in their tanks because there was no competing with the US and USSR in a war of attrition where quantity will always win out. With what little resources the Germans had, they opted to shift gears and make what few vehicles they could produce the best war machines they could possibly be. But with shortages of oil becoming more and more dire, factories that can even produce these big cats being bombed into oblivion, and a good many of these machines just dying to mechanical failure because of overengineering or inferior metals being used in the machining, one could make the counterargument that these behemoths were more trouble than they were worth and they would've been better sticking to the Panzer IV as their ride-or-die tank.
I think Kirkuk in Iraq had started producing. But otherwise yes you are right. Everyone slightly gets carried away with the implications of oil supply in the North Africa and Middle East Campaigns. Its really persia that is knocking out supply. But the possibility of exploitation of oil in Iraq, Kuwait and even Saudi Arabia was known by the late 30s. It was a long term opportunity.
As the Luftwaffe found itself unable to replace its losses as early as the Battle of Britain, a steadily weaker and weaker air defense within Germany led to strategic bombing crippling Germany's ability to produce everything from handguns to Tiger II's.
Just to note that virtually none of the middle east oil fields had been opened up. There were no wells, and no refineries.
Essentially yes. Mainland Europe isn't particularly well known for its wealth of oil in particular among other essential wartime resources. Even with Europe's largest oil fields in Romania under German control, Germany was still operating at a net deficit of oil for the entire course of the war. Attempts were made to resolve this by driving to the Baku oil fields deep within the Soviet Union in 1942, but failed when the 6th Army at Stalingrad was encircled, causing a full retreat from the Caucasus in fear of a total encirclement of Army Group South.
