The Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Mayans, the Chinese, the Malians and the Indians are just a few examples of cultures that we know had rich mathematical traditions. There are entire books devoted to each of them.
There are variations in the mathematical notation and idioms used across different scientific fields however, as folks tend to use whatever form is most prevalent and well liked within their field, however these variations tend to be much slighter than even dialectical differences let alone the shifts between properly different languages.
Aside from differences in the way numbers are represented there have also been great differences in the mathematical concepts that have circulated regionally and the notations used. One famous example is the near simultaneous co-invention (or discovery) of calculus by both Newton and Leibniz in the 1600s. This resulted in regional variations in the notations used for calculus which persisted for decades until a variation that was closer to Leibniz' notation eventually won out. And that illustrates one of the important mechanisms at play here. Scientific communication has been nearly global for several centuries, and when materials are translated between different languages it's much more important to translate the words than the notation. With math the notation is the least important aspect, as long as it's clear. It's understanding the concepts behind the notation which takes work, after which learning one notation or several is trivial, and then you tend to favor whichever notation makes things clearer. This is in contrast to language, where the notation is much closer to the material and where there's rarely such a thing as a translation between languages that is completely accurate, due to the different cultural contexts that get embedded into any language's terminology, idioms, phrasing, etc.
Then we have the Reinassanse. You have Europeans being influenced by the ancient greeks, but also by the arabs and the indians. These different mathematical traditions merged and were improved upon. As a result soon after the end of Middle Ages you have people using Algebra to find the Quadratic Formula, the Fibonacci series, and early ideas about negative and imaginary numbers.
