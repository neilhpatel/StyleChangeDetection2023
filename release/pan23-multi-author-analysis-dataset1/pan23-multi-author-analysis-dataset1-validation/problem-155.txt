Itâ€™s funny how there are articles saying the sanctions are having no impact, articles that say a limited impact and articles acting like the sanctions are devastating.
I trust the IMF. They only state that russia's crude flows have not been impacted much. Russian crude is trading around 57/bbl right now. They need somewhere north of 80 to keep their coffers full. Sanctions are going to take a while to fully impact them. Its not a switch.
As a person who live Iran which is heavily sanctioned although the regime brag about that they are not effective and we are growing in truth it made the whole country's economy broken fully and they are struggling in mud and they lost support of a lot of groups in different countries and can't fund any more groups, lobbyists and terrorist around of the world in a way they mostly send people with death penalties to attack with knives to other countries China left them Russia is using them to just throw them under the bus of us military to breath a lil which in conclusion it would be effective in time.
Production cost are low yes. But Russia is a petrostate and needs oil revenues to fund the govt. Especially during wartime. They need 80$ oil to fund the govt without a war going on. They have already entered into a deficit with the sharp drop in oil prices.
People also suggest that they are throwing their younger generation to the grinder, but this is Russia, they will have no problem dumping the older generation as well and promoting a boom of a new generation of completely brainwashed North Koreaned children, specially with the same China engine that feeds us also feeding them.
Russian oil is still trading below the price cap at 57.60. The sanctions are working, but Russia has built up a massive amount of reserve currencies over the years that will keep them solvent for a while.
