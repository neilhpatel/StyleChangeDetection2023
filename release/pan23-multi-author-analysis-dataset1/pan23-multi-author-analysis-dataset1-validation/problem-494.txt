Why would a non-capitalist country not be affected by such pressures? This digs at capitalism just look juvenile in the face of no viable alternative. It's really easy to criticise it, while the system that anti-capitalists advocate for has either failed everywhere (not true communism), or they exist as flawless, untested ideals in your head, with the benefit of all that bias and imagination.
Everyone know when coal, oil, gas etc. are coming under sanctions and how it will proceed. The purchases of fuel prior to those sanctions coming into force is perfectly legitimate, so stop posting articles fucking whinging about it. That serves no-one except Russia.
To do that you would need long term thinking and corporate capitalism doesnâ€™t have that, long gone are the days of classical liberal government makes the infrastructure to plan ahead or the Keynesian government intervention to make capitalism work.
We know. No one thought that Europe had completely stopped buying Russian oil and gas. At least, no one I know. They are trying to get away with buying as little as they can, and to make longer term plans to get to zero. I choose to be happy about that progress rather than mad that all of Europe can't go to zero immediately.
