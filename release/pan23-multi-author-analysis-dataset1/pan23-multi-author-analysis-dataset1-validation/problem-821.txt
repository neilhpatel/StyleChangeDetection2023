The word concubine is Latin in origin and the word concubina described a cohabiting relationship without marriage. The important thing is that concubinage came to be an officially recognised practice, with notice having to be given to the authorities of the relationship. It was used for relationships where marriage was not permitted or not desirable - for example a senator in relationship with a freedwoman, or wanting to prevent the children from the relationship having a right to inherit. (I only mention Rome first because it's the source of our English word and this question is primarily about language, not because the practice in Rome is somehow most important or influenced any others.).
It was not unknown or unheard of for a royal marriage to be annulled after a number of years, but Henry's behavior was erratic, and Catherine's declaration that her marriage was valid was the best protection she could offer her daughter, despite his imprisoning her and worsening her treatment steadily, she maintained her status as his wife. (Eventually, after Catherine's death, Mary would agree that her mother's marriage was invalid and that she was Henry's bastard child, which was a contravention of both common sense and canon law. Canon law held that a marriage entered into in good faith meant legitimacy for the descendants of that marriage, regardless of later rulings.).
So we see for example that China only outlawed the practice in 1949, Japan in the Meiji period, and there are plenty of examples in the Arab world and elsewhere of harems of women who have some status akin to, but not the same as, wife. The thing they have in common is some level of recognition.
Edward VI would succeed Henry VIII, but was underage throughout his reign and may or may not have been sickly throughout his life â€” regardless of whether he was a strong infant or not, he died in his mid-teens of a disease most likely tuberculosis, certainly a lung complaint, possibly a pneumonia.
As to non-Western cultures the same rule can be applied. If the woman he is sleeping with holds no legal status in his household and is not being paid to sleep with him (prostitute) then she was a mistress. This is the ultimate difference and the reason why the terminology is different in Western society is the general acceptance of monogamy, this acceptance meant there was only one legal position available per man and thereby anyone else was in fact a mistress by definition. This monogamy was not so generally accepted in Eastern societies where women could still hold legal status in a household outside of marriage. This is once again seen by Chinese provisions on inheritance laws regarding the rank of the woman in the household and making a separate provision for bastard children.
