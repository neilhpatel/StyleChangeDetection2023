I work for the worlds largest network company and I can tell you there are no 40k network engineers. Also, minimum LOA wage in the US is 60K, so I strongly suggest you consider changing the line of thought… Like any regulated program immigration or not, there is some abuse but the mass generalization is stupid I am a H1B product who is now an American citizen and I never made 40K… I started at 95K right out of grad school as a network engineer and before I became a citizen was promoted and over paid at times..
That is simply untrue. While some positions are bottom of the barrel, most major American technology companies actively hire international applicants on H1B and pay them the standard pay in the company. H1B visa holders have played an important role in the domestic US tech sector and the innovation it has produced especially at large cloud technology companies.
What? :O but now who will call me from Microsoft or McFee and ask me to give them gift card vouchers for Google store to help me get rid of the viruses on my PC?
