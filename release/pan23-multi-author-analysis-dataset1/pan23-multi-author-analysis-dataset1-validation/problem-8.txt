I did read the article, itâ€™s full of environmental scientists saying that the target numbers make no sense and that this is mostly just the hunting lobby pushing for it. Same shit that happens over on this side of the Atlantic.
Nordic countries are artificially keeping these animals at a critically endangered level. Itâ€™s neither controlling the population nor reintroducing them to the ecosystem. Itâ€™s simply a disgrace.
It is a shame that sweden thinks it is a good idea to cull so many maybe relocation could be better, isn't it interesting that a few years ago sweden was worried that wolves were dying, the main problem is the ecosystem if you remove all those wolves, rabbits may rise up, caribou, beavers and so forth, law of unintended consequences.
Yes. Which seems to be based on ignorance rather than an enlightened approach to wild life. One shot a wolf and got a prison sentence. Other places theyâ€™ve been blamed for attacking livestock, yet it was determined through saliva samples to have been a dog (at least the one I remember). Itâ€™s a shame really ðŸ˜”.
