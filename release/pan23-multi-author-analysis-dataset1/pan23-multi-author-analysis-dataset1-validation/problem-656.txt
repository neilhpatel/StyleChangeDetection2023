What she did do well however was manipulate him, using her virtue to demand a high price for consummation apparently. An interesting tactic, but given Henryâ€™s relationship with her older sister, one can assume there were complex interpersonal relationships going on there we can barely fathom.
Depends on whom you ask. Anne was revered during Elizabeth's lifetime. Many in England preferred an Englishman/woman over foreigners and many foreign consorts were seen as in house spies, often sending back confidential information to their home countries without anyone batting an eye, or worse, using England as a satellite. After his divorce to Anne of Cleves, Henry never married another foreigner, and the question of marrying a commoner came up again after Mary's unpopular Spanish wedding to Phillip, and again when debating Elizabeth's marriage, and not for the first or last time, raised many debates about the preference for a monarch to wed a subject.
How does she compare? From a Tudor point of view? She gave Henry his most extraordinary child. She only married the one Tudor. Also, she and her family upset a lot on the way up, and ultimately ran head long into the deadly politics that surrounded Henry.
Thank you! I know that, in 1513, Catherine was in command in defense of England when James IV invaded in Henry's absence, and that practically all the Scottish commanders, including James, were killed, so that definitely sets Catherine on a level of monarchy that Anne doesn't really compare to. It's sad how the couple were such a powerful duo in their early years and it all just faded away.
