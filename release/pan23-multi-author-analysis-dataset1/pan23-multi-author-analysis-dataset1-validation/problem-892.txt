You could probably make some kind of typology list ("Cities set aside for peace negotiations during the conflict", "Treaties imposed at the site of the invading army", "peace signed at the capital of one or the other of the powers", "peace signed at a border location" etc. But it would probably be too much work and end up with too many exceptions.
The treaties with Germany's former allies were similarly signed at western Parisian suburban locations: St-Germain-en-Laye (Austria), Neuilly-sur-Seine (Bulgaria), the Trianon (specifically Louis's Grand Trianon château in Versailles; Hungary), and Sèvres (Turkey), though the last never bacame effective and was replaced by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. The 1919-20 treaties were nevertheless collectively called the Paris Peace Treaties, though the term "Versailles settlement" later came to represent the postwar status quo.
Brest-Litovsk was the German headquarters in the 1917-18 campaigns against Russia, so it was there that the Soviet negotiators were summoned for the armistice and subsequent peace talks - hence it's analogous to Versailles in 1871.
