In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Agreed. Until virtually the entire Republican party is willing to publicly and repeatedly denounce him, he's still their guy. And the GOP won't do that until their base does that too. Once the GOP voters make it absolutely clear that they dislike Trump completely and want him gone, then he'll be broken. Until then though, I think he's still the favorite for the GOP's presidential nomination in 2024. After all, none of them can beat him if they can't even criticize him.
The Republicans got what they wanted from Trump: a completely in-the-bag SCOTUS and total chaos regarding legitimate governing, political compromise, or consensus building. The court will be the rulers, led by their theocratic temperament and protection for the oligarchs.
