"Democrats in contested state legislative races experienced ballot roll-off (only voting on the top races on your ballot and not the rest) almost 80% of the time, whereas Republicans in contested state legislative Republicans only experienced roll-off 37.25% of the time".
"If Democratic candidates had gotten just 4,451 more votes in the two closest races in the Arizona state House (0.09% of the total 5,028,382 votes cast), they would have flipped the chamber. Just 1,813 votes in the two closest districts would have flipped the Minnesota Senate. A similar story played out in Virginia in 2021, when Democrats lost the majority in the House of Delegates by just 733 votes across the three closest seats. Democrats are often closer to winning power in state chambers than aggregate vote totals suggest, which is a call to arms to keep fighting for every vote.".
