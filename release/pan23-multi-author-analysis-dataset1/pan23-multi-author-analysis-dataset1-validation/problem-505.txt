So maybe you missed this. Weaver and Harris were acquitted. (Weaver was only convicted on a bail violation $10k fine and 18 months time served). At least 1 FBI agent in jail. 1 more FBI agent indicted. FBI, ATF and USMS agents forced to resign for poor decision making and unconstitutional killing of US citizens. Not sure how you donâ€™t see that as a black eye.

Crap. I forgot when that happened. My brother in law from Texas (no offense to the non stereotypical Texans) is now dragging around an oxygen bottle from the fake COVID virus.
