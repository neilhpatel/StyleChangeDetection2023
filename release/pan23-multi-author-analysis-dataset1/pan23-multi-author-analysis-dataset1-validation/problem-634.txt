How would you fight an argument that when we engage in sexual contact we have a "rough" sex with much more "violence" than the normal shake of a person that didn't know what she was doing highly intoxicated behind the wheel of a vehicle that endangered the life of quite a few people? So she likes "rough" sex and doesn't accuse me for that, but yet in another act me shaking her is taken as violent? I just don't understand why would I get charged for something again she didn't accuse me in...It's also one thing to take this as an act of violence and it's complete madness to go ahead and say you find her other two bruises accusations credible and plausible too, that automatically means that the judge believed I am lying since I said it's the first time I see the bruises and haven't caused them, what gives the judge the right to assume things like that at the end...
Those are entirely different things. As different as going to the gym and boxing with someone, versus sucker punching an obnoxious blowhard in a bar.
