EIC ships were turned away from ports in the rest of the colonies before they could offload their cargo, but the Governor of Massachusetts, Thomas Hutchinson, refused to give in to popular pressure and refused to allow the British ships to return to England (at issue here was the payment of import duties to the colonies, different than the waived export duties owed to England - Hutchinson's sons and some of his friends were consignees of the tea shipment, and not only would the colony lose the import duty payment, but also the potential income from the sale of the tea. He had a lot to lose, personally, in both real and political terms). When several ultimatums had come and gone, a general meeting of citizens at the Old South Meeting House broke up with "a general huzza for Griffin's wharf.".
In addition to the excellent reply above, it's important to note that although the so-called "Boston Tea Party" was a relatively local event, and therefore could have been organized by New England-based smugglers, it was only one occurrence in a broader protest against the tax on tea that could never have been pulled off by smugglers. When EIC tea arrived in other ports, including Philadelphia, New York, and Charleston, locals also protested and largely stopped the tea from being imported. For example, discontent had stoked the colonists of Charles Town, SC into a frenzy on December 1, 1773, weeks before the events in Boston. In Charles Town, the colonists were aware that of laws concerning unloaded cargo in the harbor and refused to allow the London to disembark more than 200 chests of EIC tea. With the tea essentially forfeited by the ship's investors, it was sized by custom agents for nonpayment of the tax and moved to the Exchange where it was locked away. While this may have been a short-term boon for local smugglers, to suggest they whipped up the entire town is unfathomable. As smugglers were largely independent workers, it is incredibly unlikely to believe they orchestrated such a large protest. Furthermore, it is impossible to think smugglers in Charlestown relayed their message roughly one thousand miles north.
