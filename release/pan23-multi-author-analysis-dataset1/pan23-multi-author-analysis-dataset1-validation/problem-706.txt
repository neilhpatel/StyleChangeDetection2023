Without reviewing your lease, I can't say what other reprecussions are in order, but LL has an obligation to protect your right to enjoy your space from other tenants...and their dog's pee. This sounds like laziness to me.
Just to clarify, I think OP was referring to management being unable (or unwilling) to take any sort of immediate action without them specificity seeing the dog in the residence proper, not specifically urinating at that time, just presence.
Set up a camera and point it at their balcony. Make sure it's time stamped. Film the dog doing its business for a week or two, then take the footage to management. It should be easy enough to prove they aren't 'dogsitting' (is that even allowed under this company's leases?).
Unfortunately, even if the lease states "no pets" (most boilerplate leases usually include notations regarding any animal presence, regardless of short-term stays, and will just flat out state that "all pets must be approved", etc.) Management still has discretion, and can choose to take no action.
