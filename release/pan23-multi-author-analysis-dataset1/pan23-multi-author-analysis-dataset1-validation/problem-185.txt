In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. This is an interesting one, though. Devolder-Santos Campaign expenses are all $199.99; Food/Beverage 4/3/21 $199.99, Hotel Stay 7/22/21 $199.99, Airfare 8/13/21 $199.99, Taxi Fare 10/8/21 $199.99 - the spreadsheet goes on and on. More specifically, many of those expenses are for Il Bacco Restaurant, some on the same day. He'll be running for President in 2028. Probably.

In late November, the Daily Beast reported that Andrew Intrater (a cousin of and money manager for sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg) gave more than $56,000 to political committees supporting George Santos, who defeated Democrat Robert Zimmerman Nov. 8.
I don’t understand why this is such a big tadoo. Dump spouted equally as ridiculous lies for years and the media just acted like business as usual. Not to mention the Republicans didn’t give two shits when the media finally started to kinda call him on his shit. Why is all of this guys lies all over this page. We already know Republicans vote for liars, this isn’t new, and it isn’t news at this stage.
