Yep. Growing up, I remember there being a distinct separation between Denver, Castle Rock, and the Springs. Last time I was out there, it was one, unbroken suburb between all of it. It was shocking.
Then I grew up, and discovered that, not only had I been capable of being my parents' intellectual equal in my teens, not only that I'd actually been programmed to be a simpering doormat for anyone with a raised voice who happened to be in my life, but I'm LGBT myself, and it's actually really hard to get yourself killed or even hurt from things like cannabis, or going 40 mph in a 35 zone, or having friends who aren't Christians, or being a huge fan of heavy metal, D&D, random childrens' book serieses, tv shows featuring characters who are witches, horror movies, video games that happen to have violence somehow, etc.
I was 5. It took me decades to deal with the flight or fight or freeze she gave me. No idea where she got the idea any of this was acceptable.
