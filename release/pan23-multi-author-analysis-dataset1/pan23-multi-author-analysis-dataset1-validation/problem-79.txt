Do you have an attorney? If not, you absolutely need one. Felony charges are not the kind of thing you should DIY. If you cannot afford to hire a paid attorney, apply for a free attorney through the public defender/go through your jurisdiction's process for receiving a court-appointed lawyer.
There was a house with damages done to it. They said the back window was broken and barricaded from the inside. When they got to the location I was walking in the yard lost trying to find my phone. I am on new depression meds and have reports with drs about having serious side effects. They said I had dirt on me and there was dirt in the residence when he unbarricated the window and went inside the home. I was on their body camera in the yard when they showed up. I was afraid bc my meds cause paranoia and they were questioning me about the house and damage. I told them it wasn’t me. They said the dirt on me says otherwise. I am not a criminal have no record no arrests. Been depressed for urs and started meds bc I was really in a bad place. The meds help but they also have lots of bad side effects. Also I appreciate the help if you have any. I don’t mean to leave things out I just felt like I could respond more if it was needed. I’ve never been in this situation or process before asking for legal help so anything is highly appreciated.
In process of finding attorney. They gave me a week until court from when I got out the psych ward. I have been looking for pro Bono lawyers in my area and going to sign up for public defender tomorrow.
