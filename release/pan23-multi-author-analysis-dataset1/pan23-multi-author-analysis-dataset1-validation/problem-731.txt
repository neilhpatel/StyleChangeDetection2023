Allowing the federal reserve to rapidly raise rates is the chemo-therapy solution to inflation which increases cost of manufacturing and increases future risk of recession and causes further business cycles. A better way to suck money out of circulation is a national property tax with deductions for the replacement cost of non-vacant, non-obsolete improvements and state & local property taxes actually paid. As tax falling heavily on vacant & abandoned land which is untaxed locally would suck up money without raising the cost of production. And redistributing vacant land would be good for renters, as excess price paid for access to land is surplus value which doesn't really contribute GDP or wages, even if it is accounted that way by national income statistics.
Completely agree with you here. But where I differ is that at the end of the day the economy affects all of us and it is happening on Biden's watch. Trump absolutely is the reason we're in this situation. Low interest rates and the PPP loans. But Republicans are spinning it to say its the government hand-outs to the middle-class and poor which is the problem. I think thats absurd. I don't think anyone has gotten rich off of a 1k stimulus check and the media keeps spinning this narrative. As a progressive, I continue to think Biden doesn't go far enough to protect the lower/middle class. Interest rate hikes are affecting the very people who voted him in.
Yes, definitely. The government can directly orginate mortgages without a central bank. The government can suck money out of circulation to reduce inflation without raising interest rates. The best way to suck money out of circulation would be a national property tax, with deductions for the replacement cost of non-vacant, non-obsolete improvements and state & local property taxes actually paid. As this would directly tax vacant land, abandoned buildings, and corporations with excessive state & local property tax abatements and not raise the cost of production.
