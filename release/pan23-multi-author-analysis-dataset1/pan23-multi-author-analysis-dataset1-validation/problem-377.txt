Also note who else Doheny is calling 'Bolshevist": President Woodrow Wilson; Charles William Eliot, who was President of Harvard from 1869 to 1909; Frank Vanderlip, President of National City Bank of New York (the future Citibank), and Charles R. Crane, a wealthy oil heir who was a donor to the Wilson campaign and involved in Wilsonian diplomacy (and who later would get into hot water for favorable comments about Hitler). Also notice that Doheny is singling out 'peace committees',pacifists and socialists, who in the 1919 context would have been groups opposed to US participation in the First World War. Basically Doheny is listing a who's who of notable progressive figures connected to Wilson, and groups further to the left, and smearing them all as being in league with Bolsheviks (who in the context of February 1919 were a rag-tag group clinging to power in the Russian Civil War, but with an upsurge in strikes and industrial action in the United States after the end of the war in 1918 were thought to be destabilizing American society - this would lead to the "Red Scare" of 1919).
It was the current basis for the Federal Reserve! The Federal Reserve itself summarises it as follows:^1.
So Woodrow Wilson championed neutrality before favoring US intervention in the war, but also disputed bitterly with Republicans like Roosevelt and Lodge over America's goals in the war and peace (Wilson was a "liberal internationalist", wanting to use US participation in the war to establish a new international order, while Lodge and Roosevelt were more great power "realists", wanting to militarily defeat Germany to the utmost and establish the United States as a great power well-positioned against rival powers).
