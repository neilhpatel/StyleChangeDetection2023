It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks, but "The Greatest Love of All" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation, dignity. Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really. And it's beautifully stated on the album.
fucking pathetic how the world had to endure 6 years of flag waving mobs, lifted truck parades, flotillas of trump paraphernalia bedecked boats and all of the other horse shit and they unceremoniously drop him like a sack of rancid trumpâ„¢ brand steaks in an alley behind the rnc headquarters. really goes to show how 'sincerely held' their beliefs are. the right are, and will always be, a fucking clownshow.
