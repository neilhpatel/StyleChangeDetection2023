They don't like that one lol.
Why yes, existing as a sovereign democratic country while strenhening ties to the civilized world and improving its peoples lives by tackling corruption all while being within eyesight of Russias perpetually oppressed population is an existential threat to Putin’s authoritarian regime. Definitely a provocation worthy of a genocidal invasion….. Mr. Watters, you’ve lost the god damn plot man.
