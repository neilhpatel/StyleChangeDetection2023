There are currently lots of (so far unconfirmed) reports that their retreat is going very badly for them today. , pro-Russian sources report that Russian troops are treating in panic as Ukraine enters Kherson city, and that Ukrainian artillery is fiercely hitting the few Russian river crossings.
See. I kinda disagree. First of all, I didn't say it can't work, I said it is destined to go bad. That's a difference.
Did you see the video of the Russian newscaster who said that if he supports the retreat he's discrediting the territorial integrity of Russia and goes to jail (Russian criminal code section 280 article 1), and if he denounces it then he's discrediting the Russian armed forces and goes to jail (Russian criminal code section 280 article 3).
A dozen? No. But I could see several splintered factions. Maybe east and west Russia. I call dibs on naming the southern Caucasus region, "Caucasia.".
America basically has the civil war codified by lawusing a two party the winner takes all system with the office of president collecting more and more authority over the years, things that were in the hand of congress before.
