3. The Gold Rush and explosion of Johannesburg change things. The British see far more value in South Africa than just a port of passage to India. The Boers become increasingly paranoid and distrustful of the British as they both demographic shifts with the importing of primarily Mozambiquan and African labour to undercut South African labour.
This is so helpful, thank you. My knowledge of Dominion politics and history is embarrassingly limited outside of Ireland, so this has been a fascinating read.
1. From Brits landing and taking Ownership of the Cape Colony, the relationship between Afrikaners/Boer and the Brits has been adversarial at best.
Basically Britain was faced by an exceptionally strong nationalism in South Africa, the attempts at Anglocization were failed. For example the governor Milner wanted to use Rugby and sport to anglicize the population. Well rugby became the Afrikaner sport by 1910(Douglas Booth, The Race Game: Sport and Politics in South Africa). South Africa because it was white controlled, like Canada, Australia and New Zealand, was given a bit more leeway, and with the strain of WW1, Britain is forced to give up some of the holding and relent to nationalism, especially in the case of South Africa when Hertzog and the National Party mainted control of parliament through the 1920s. To be clear though, what was put in place in 1910 by the South Africa Act was not independence or British forfieture. It was unionisation and consolidation to a central South African Government, that was still very much second to the whims of Britain.
