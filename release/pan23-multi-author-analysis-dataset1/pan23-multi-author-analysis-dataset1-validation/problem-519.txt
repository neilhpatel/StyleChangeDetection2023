In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Literally unconstitutional. The First Amendment protects the citizenry's right to free expression from government censorship. But let's waste millions of taxpayer dollars to let the courts tell us what we already know. They pretend to be the party of the Constitution, the party of fiscal restraint. The reality is, this is what American fascism looks like.

Essentially if you could use one section of the Constitution to invalidate a newer interpretation of another section then SCOTUS could essentially rewrite the Constitution without ever changing a word. Which in many respects is what they've been doing.
After all, if someone they consider a "man in a dress" is legally classified as an "adult performer" when all they're doing is reading Mary Poppins to kids in a library while dressed as the titular character, what exactly does that mean for the person whom they consider as a "man in a dress" who is just trying to go to her job as a 5th grade Math teacher? Or hell, just trying to go to the grocery store?
Ultimately the idea of money being speech is such an insane bastardization of the first amendment as to be ludicris but because of the way the system works it cannot really be challenged in any meaningful way until we do away with the conservative majority on the supreme court which given how rigged the system has become and how conservatives are seeking to further rig it I'm not sure that is even possible. It might end up that a complete abolish and rebuild is inevitable for America to survive as these kinds of open contradictions make the country itself unsustainable.
