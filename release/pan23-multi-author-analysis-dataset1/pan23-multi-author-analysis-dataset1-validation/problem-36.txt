(3) But to address why Japan "westernized," the simple answer is because they didn't see it that way. They adopted Western ideas without construing them as necessarily Western, a process that Ravina calls "cosmopolitan chauvinism." In effect, Japanese leaders and thinkers integrated Western cultural products and values into their own society by asserting that they were actually reflective of universal, rather than culturally relative, principles. In the same way, a more ancient Japanese society had integrated Confucian principles without necessarily "Sinicizing" or becoming "more Chinese," at least not from the perspective of those in Meiji Japan. From this perspective, Meiji Japan was not adopting "Western" cultural values; it was recognizing self-evident, universal principles and adopting them in the way it had done with Confucianism, Buddhism, etc.
This is a much better answer than mine. I realised after sending it that - after rereading the question - I hadn't really answered it at all but gone off on a random tangent.
