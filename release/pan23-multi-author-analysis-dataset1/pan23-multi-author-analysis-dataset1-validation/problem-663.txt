The morale and political investment of Red Army soldiers is another factor that must shoulder some of the blame for the mass surrender incidents. Elite units like paratroopers drew heavily from Communist Party membership and should be considered to have a high level of political buy-in; however, the Red Army as a whole was a rather mixed bag on this front. One example presented itself in the recruits from the Ukraine and Baltic states: “The fact that, during the prewar years, there were a great number of Red Army men, as well as military service men from the reserves of the western regions of Ukraine and Moldova and the former bourgeois Baltic states...who required additional attention from all political organs.” These recruits, especially those less educated, did not hold the desired level of socialist idealism. During the dark days of late 1941, many an NKVD officer's reports to headquarters mentioned pessimistic grumblings from the troops. Self-mutilations or outright desertions were frequent. Especially before it became apparent how poorly POWs would be treated, many men (especially but I must emphasize not exclusively Ukrainians and members of other nationalities who often felt little loyalty to the Russian-dominated Soviet state) found it preferable to surrender than fight for a cause they held little love for.
It is where the main fault lies, btw. Soviet Intelligence (all of its branches, both military and civilian) back then lacked one the main qualities of proper intelligence agency - ability to process and analyze information gathered. Essentially, Stalin and all other people in the USSR leadership were using reports unfiltered and unprocessed by the analytics departments. It is why you have infamous Stalin's resolution on one of the reports from Germany. And honestly, I cannot fault Stalin for that because that report consisted mostly of bullcrap with only one grain of truth in it. So you can probably imagine a frustration of a person who was forced to deal with such intelligence on the day to day basis.

"for Stalin's seemingly idiotic attempts to stave off war with Germany, going so far as to ignore dozens of separate intelligence reports indicating that a German invasion was obviously imminent).".
This issue boils down to several disputed possibilities, all of them having the same result: Stalin simply did not expect operation barbarossa and, being in total control of virtually everything in the USSR, him being caught off guard meant the entire USSR would not be ready. The question of why Stalin didn't expect barbarossa is one with disputed answers. There are people who have written on Stalin (e.g. Edvard Radzinsky) who state that Stalin didn't expect barbarossa due to its undeniable and incredible stupidity. It would open up a second front to a war that had already devolved into a stalemate with the nazis being incapable of properly invading England. Others state that for some inexplicable reason, Stalin trusted the non-aggression pact. Either way, we know that even after being repeatedly warned about operation Barbarossa, even being given its exact date, Stalin refused to authorize any hostile move towards Germany.
