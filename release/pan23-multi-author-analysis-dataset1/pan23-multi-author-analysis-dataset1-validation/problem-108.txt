It's no longer possible to determine in anything resembling the timespan of a normal online interaction on a comment thread, for example. You'd likely need, say, 10 comments/messages exchanged or more to be able to definitively tell (and that's based on currently publicly available models. Who knows what Google has -- we know fairly little about the performance of models like LaMDA and PaLM beyond what Google wants us to see.) When this knowledge permeates society and becomes conventional wisdom, I'd imagine online forums and other casual forms of online communication (I.e. forums not somehow anchored in the real world through a real group, or populated by people known personally to you) will be in for some trouble. Assuming captchas or potentially personal online IDs become commonplace. I'm hoping for the former, but who can say?
It's now basically impossible to be proficient in Machine Learning, and one has basically need to specialize in a much narrower field to be deemed specialist as opposed to only have a global but quite superficial understanding of Machine Learning.
Cool. Because writing a robust, structured directive is called coding a program. That's what it is. No matter what, you need people who understand how to build logical structures, that's all programming is. That's why I don't care what language it's in, I'm confident I can pick it up: programming is all just languages of logic. I'm good at logic.
It's no replacement for google (as a "knowledge indexing and retrieval system"), it will contribute to making search engines worse, in fact, by increasing the amount of artificially generated and indexed noise on the internet.
I'm gonna be fine. You're imagining a future where CEOs and the super billionaires are the ones telling AIs what to do, and that's plum dumb. Just unabashedly stupid. I know you're not actually imagining that though, your cynical brain stops working after two steps. But that's the end result of your cynical outlook and as with all cynicism, it's way over blown.
