Not to excuse them in any way but I suspect many private corporations (and some public eg Enron) are the same, dominated by the owner with tame executives and board members and no accountability. Lawyers and accountants are bought off (as allegedly here), creditors schmoozed or ignored and auditors and regulators are generally useless at spotting and stopping illegality unless months or years afterwards.
As much as I despise trump, I think he'll walk on this. As article says, "Weisselberg said he \[Weisselberg\] then instructed the company's controller to deduct the $100,000 from his salary, allowing him to report a smaller income.".

'Weisselberg? Never herd of him. Must had been a coffee boy or something. I mean of course I'm pictured with him, all sorts of people have their picture taken with me. John Eastman-Kodak invented the camera for me. Everyone was saying "What's a Kodak, I've never heard of a Kodak?" but then he took a picture of me and everyone knew what a Kodak was from then on ....'.
