Jewish identity was very hotly contested in the Second Temple period and particularly the first century, because of centuries of outside colonization and conquest. If you read a lot of Second Temple texts, you'll see a pattern of labeling "good" and "bad" Jews based on whatever criteria the author is trying to push. The first chapter of 1 Maccabees is really informative for this, both because of the exclusionist language and because the conflict is very obviously what a modern westerner would call political, not religious.
They do not eat red meat. (You can see where I'm going with this -- do you see the traditional lamb in Jesus' birth offering, or in his last meal?).
The reasons why Jews specifically were persecuted, expelled, and discriminated against throughout mainly European history can vary greatly depending on time and place, but there are overarching historical factors that can help us understand the historical persecution of Jews - mainly that they often were the only minority available to scapegoat.
1. AD 47-50, Romans establish themselves to the farthest West, in what will become Londoninium -- that date is pretty close to Jesus' ministry. Bringing along their garrison grab-bag of beliefs, including presumably Christianity.
Paula Fredriksen handles this nicely in Paul (2017). In short, of course Paul doesn't expect gentiles to follow Judean ancestral tradition--they're gentiles. Judean apocalyptic tradition makes room for gentiles turning to God as gentiles, and that's what Paul is pushing. Paul has his own relationship with Judean tradition and especially purity standards like food taboo, but for gentiles those are irrelevant, and faith in the Judean god (who for Paul and other philosophically educated Jews is the universal god) is about participation in the spirit by means of the community, NOT about becoming Jewish.
2. The name Nazarenes was the first name the Christians called themselves. The name Christian came later, as an exonym of the Gentiles -- and Paul found it convenient to adopt for a reason.
