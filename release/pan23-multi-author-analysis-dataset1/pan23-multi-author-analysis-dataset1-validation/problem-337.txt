This is why youâ€™ll hear various counts of how many amendments he proposed. This is because he himself grouped them differently than in their final adopted form, and at various times different paragraphs were combined or separated into different amendments during debate. Arguably what became the 1st Amendment really should have been 3 different items; freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom to assemble are different rights. But Madison and later Congress grouped them together. This is why people often say he proposed 19 or 20 amendments instead of just 9.
Ultimately he proposed 9 amendments, of which most were reworked into 12 adopted by Congress. Eventually 11 of the 12 would be ratified, although one would take till 1992.
Kentucky was the last state to ratify; making 11 of the necessary 12 at the time. None have ratified it since the 1790s. The full list of states ratifying are: Kentucky, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia.
2. Can states revoke their ratification? If so, does it matter if they do it before the deadline (as 4 states did) or after it (as South Dakota did)?
