It still seems pretty unfair to me. Employers have more power than their employees so employers can force employees to do things that they don’t want/approve. I use the term ‘force’ because essentially that is what it is; Unfortunately in this world not everyone can afford to find a new job, let alone quitting, leaving the employer with the higher advantage (as the case for my mom). Perhaps that is why they call it the ‘workforce’. You could try to argue it’s a choice but in the end of the day so is the case for a robber with a hand gun to your head. You could choose to not give the robber what they want, after all, that is your choice. In both cases it’s a choice but it’s a forced choice.
I agree with the other things you said and there are some ways to address that with regards to employment, understanding that the USA employment landscape is what it is until a "better" system can be adopted -- but at the end of the day, no employment structure in any country is perfect to the extent that it protects both the employer and employee to a degree that everyone can agree on. They all have their benefits from whatever perspective, and usually, an equal amount of detriments.
