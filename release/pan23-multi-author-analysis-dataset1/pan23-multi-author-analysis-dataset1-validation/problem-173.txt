If you do not have Comprehensive coverage, which I can't imagine you do on a 20 year old car, your insurance carrier likely can't help you here. Also, since the vehicle was in the care of a dealership, a bailment clause may apply meaning that since it was in the care of the dealership, your insurance could deny coverage (imagine this depends on the state you're in and your specific policy).
Thank you for your advice! I think I’ll do this. And you’re right, it was my family’s car growing up and the car I learned to drive in. So many good memories and it was in great shape. Looked at estimates for what I might get and it was so low. Better than nothing but you are right, I was surprised.
Vintage cars and bikes are a completely different market, but older mass market cars are significantly cheaper for comprehensive and collision than newer ones - in my case, when I had two 10+ year old cars, I was paying about $5/mo comprehensive and $10/collision (and over $100/mo for PD, liability, and UM).
