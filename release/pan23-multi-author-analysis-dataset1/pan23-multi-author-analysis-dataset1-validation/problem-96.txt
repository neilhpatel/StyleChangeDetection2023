So what to do? Consider 1) telling your wife's attorney in writing that you need time to think about the deal, that she is not authorized to take you off the deed or do anything unusual with joint accounts until you do, 2) consider filing the complaint yourself, as that usually freezes things until there is an agreement, but that depends on your state, 3) either hire a lawyer or consider jointly hiring a lawyer as a mediator.

Fifth, consider jointly hiring a lawyer as a mediator -- that gives you the ability to ask the mediator privately questions like, hey, what would I likely get in court on this issue, or is there a creative way to get me a fairer share of the equity without her having to move, or if I give her this equity in the house, how do I know she won't move in a year anyway?
God yes. If she hired this attorney, that attorney works for her. The reason everything is so amicable is because everything is going her way.
