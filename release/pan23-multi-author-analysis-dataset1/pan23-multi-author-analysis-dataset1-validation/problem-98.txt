Trump committed many crimes, LIVE ON TELEVISION, confessed to others, LIVE ON TELEVISION, and when questioned in interviews, doubled down on his confessions, justifications for his actions.
No shit. Not all investigations take the same amount of time. To think you'd be able to charge some minion and a mastermind for the same crime in the same amount of time is laughable. I don't see how this proves the DOJ is acting politically. If anything, it seems to be proving I'm debating someone woefully ignorant on how federal investigation ls work.
Interesting question. I think the short answer is: that wonâ€™t really be a factor. The question will be how the facts line up for each potential charge. Your question does, however, lead me to think about the Mar-a-Lago investigation (one of the two DOJ probes, the other being Jan. 6). Because there, the general issue of classified/national defense information forms the factual backdrop of a potential criminal case that could come from that investigation. But ultimately, in all of the several probes into Trump, I think it will be more about the direct question of how the facts line up with the specific text of each criminal law at issue.
Hello. What is your opinion on the media coverage of Trump? Trump seems to get more coverage than anyone else, including the current Biden administration, long after Trump has been out of office.
