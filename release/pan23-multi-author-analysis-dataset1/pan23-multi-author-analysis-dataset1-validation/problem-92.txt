More to the point, iron weapons were not really any better than bronze weapons (indeed, it's arguably the other way around). The main advantage of switching to iron is that iron production was not dependent on long distance trade routes, whereas bronze production required importing tin from Cornwall and Afghanistan. There's always more to be said on this, but u/wotan_weevil wrote about this in and.
In theory, the benefits granted by the innovation of iron are based less on some supposed superiority over bronze and more on its cost efficiency- while being roughly equivalent to bronze in strenh & durability (if perhaps slightly inferior), iron is much cheaper & easier to produce. This is important because it allows for civilizations to use strong metals on a much broader scale. Iron means bigger, better equipped armies & farms for a lower cost. Where the average farmer, laborer, or hunter might have found bronze tools prohibitively expensive they can now use a broad range of iron tools for more reasonable cost. The benefits of this can be quite significant.
