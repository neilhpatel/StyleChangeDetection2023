Consider first that that's not the worst thing Dante Alighieri writes about the Church as a contemporary institution and about the actions of individual Popes. In Inferno XIX, for instance, Dante bumps into Pope Nicholas III (1277-1280) among the simoniacs, i.e., those who sell Church offices and assets for personal gain. Nicholas and the Simoniacs (a potentially great name for a band, incidentally) are half buried upside down and their feet are set on fire. Because Nicholas cannot see Dante, he mistakes him for Boniface VIII (1294-1303) and even predicts that he will soon be joined among the Simoniacs by Clement V (1305-1314). Indeed the historical Dante Alighieri had direct beef with Boniface VIII, who is said to have operated for the poet's exile from Florence in 1302 (still several years before he started composing the Commedia).
Oh ok. I thought those were generally about his life. I'd like to read something that analyzes the whole Comedy or even just a particular book. I haven't read it yet. But I'd like something to read soon after. I find criticism about the Catholic Church in those times very interesting.
Fantastic! Personally, I envy the opportunity you have to read the Commedia for the first time. It's a book that rewards a second (and third, and fourth...) read, as you will better appreciate how things are interconnected and at times scandalously self-contradictory; but also one that specifically encourages and rewards first-time readers. I will not spoil anything but I'll say that there's a lot to learn from falling in the traps that Dante sets up for first-time readers along the way. I think they are worth falling into, so perhaps there's something to be said for going into the text without much preparation. Any good commentary will supplement your reading if you need some notes, but I wouldn't worry too much about it at this stage and just enjoy the ride.
