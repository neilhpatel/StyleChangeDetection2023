Those obstacles seemed to be the only cover on the beach. Once they were off the landing craft, it seems like hiding behind those obstacles gave them a moment to collect their wits and catch their breath before making a mad dash across the open beach. Has anyone ever written about that?
I'm personally a fan of Atkinson's work as a an excellent, accessible history of the US fight against Germany, but I would of course note that it is a history of the campaign in Northwest Europe as a whole, not just a history of D-Day, so not as applicable here.
It depended on the beach. At Utah, it was about 3-400 yards from the low-tide mark to the high-tide mark, then a further 1-200 yards to the beach exits. At Omaha, the beach spanned about 350-450 yards from the low-tide line to the seawall. The British beaches were somewhat shorter - they landed later due to delays, while wind blowing waves further onto the beach. On parts of Sword Beach, the width of the beach was usually 30 yards at high tide, but on the 6th, it was less than 30 feet.
