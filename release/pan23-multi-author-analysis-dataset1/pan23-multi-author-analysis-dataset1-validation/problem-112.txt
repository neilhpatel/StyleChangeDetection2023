In their view, the globalization of the bourgeoisie created a single common interest for the proletariat, who, comprising the vast majority of industrial society, had only to realize their power and assume control worldwide. The workers would then establish “lower state communism” (or “socialism” as Lenin and other later thinkers have called it) where state power and money or a money like medium of exchange would still exist and a “dictatorship of the proletariat” (most commonly read as not a literal dictatorship but a contrast to the “dictatorship of the bourgeoisie” that was republican governance) would restructure society to eliminate all class divisions and make all people equal. At the end of this project the state would simply “wither away” as humanity would have no more need for it.
In the Marxist stage-ist view of society, under feudalism that organ was controlled by the aristocracy (hereditary land owners, as wealth was basically just how much land you had before industrial capital), under capitalism by the bourgeoisie (thanks to the invention of industrial capital), and under lower-phase communism/socialism, by the proletariat. Eventually, with the dissolution of all classes as distinctions between people on the basis of wealth/their relationship to production break down, the concept of a state ceases to make sense as there are no classes anymore to either exercise their will or be the target of that will.
Thanks for reading it! I was worried I was too late to the party. The other answer is good too but I was in too deep to back out by the time I saw it.
