Both sides are bad? That's how the entire history of Palestine has gone. How about we stick to the 1967 borders, instead of colonising our neighbours.
Palastine and hamas aren't the same although some arab countries do help them but that's the only way they can and they also do that because non of the Western countries help palastine also they can't say they help hamas because then it can be said that palastine and the arab countries help terrorists which makes the case for palastine way worse so it's a bit of a balance they want to damage Israel but not directly to look like the bad guys but on the other hand Israel evict them from their home kill some of them injure some of them and the west watch and do nothing so they want to retaliate but not too much and the cycle continues.
You have that backwards. Palestine is the country that the Israelis claim is theirs. And do you mean the terror attacks that the Israelis undertake against the Palestinians? Or are you condoning their genocidal tactics and their illegal war?
