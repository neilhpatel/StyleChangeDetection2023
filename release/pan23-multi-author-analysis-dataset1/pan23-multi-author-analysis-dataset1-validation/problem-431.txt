The other thing I see mentioned is their again, deluded, belief that their "wonderweapons" would solve everything. Didn't this factor in too?
As for what the Nazis were holding out all this time for, it wasn't much holding out for something but the hardened belief in no surrender as to avoid the perceived humiliation of Germany's defeat in 1918; or if leaders were sufficiently fanatical/delusional, a genuine belief in Endsieg. As for officers and leaders who did have cooler heads, most were aware of the unspeakable crimes committed both in the Eastern Front and from the Holocaust, and that surrender would almost certainly mean execution by the Allied forces. For them, the decision to fight on was because there was no other alternative but either hang from Nazi or Allied ropes.
As to why holding out for any kind of separate peace simply wasn't in the cards, look no further than Nazi Germany's conduct during the war. A nation that launched a war of naked aggression against all its neighbors, blatantly broke or dishonored every single treaty it signed with foreign powers, forced entire populations within their occupied territories into slave labor, and exterminated anyone they deemed unworthy of life. Any kind of peace treaty signed with Nazi Germany wouldn't be worth the paper it was written on with their history of blatant disregard for good faith or conduct on the world stage. The Allies' purpose in accepting nothing less than unconditional surrender was to send the message that defeat in the war would be no one's fault but those who perpetrated the war, unlike previous German attempts to pass the blame for defeat on treachery or a stab-in-the-back.
From there, German plans to obtain their victory rested in repelling an anticipated Allied invasion of France, hoping that defeating a major landing would force the Western Allies to pursue a separate peace in favor of Germany. This never came to be as the Allies successfully landed in Normandy and began the liberation of France. After that failure, the Germans' counteroffensive through the Ardennes in December of 1944 was intended to break through and capture Antwerp, encircle and crush the main Allied force on the Western Front and again try to force a separate peace, but the Battle of the Bulge also ended in complete failure.
