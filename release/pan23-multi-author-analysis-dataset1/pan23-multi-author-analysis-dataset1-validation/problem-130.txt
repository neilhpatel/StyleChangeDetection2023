Not surprisingly, she also doesn't claim that this signature was validated and counted in 2020. She just implies it.
Looking at the court filing, she also says, "The separation of votes between Hobbs and Lake is far narrower than the number of presumptively illegal and illegally cast ballots in Arizona." Her evidence: "Witnesses who were present... as well as other facts meticulously gathered, show hundreds of thousands of illegal ballots infected the election in Maricopa County.".
For the signature verification process we are led to believe that the innocent republican workers who were rejecting 30-40% of all mail in/EV ballots for signature mismatch were doing so for valid reasons while the other checkers who found that to be BS were in on a conspiracy to include ineligible ballots. It's much more likely that the republican workers were wrongly trying to invalidate large number of ballots.
