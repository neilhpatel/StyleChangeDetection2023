It seems like he was terminated for not getting along with a friend of the boss, which is legal. He should qualify for unemployment. Frustrating situation.
Oh, and I missed the last question in your previous comment. An attorney is not necessary to file an EEOC complaint, though they can be helpful. Your boyfriend can file a discrimination charge himself, and the EEOC will pursue the charge on his behalf if they determine this does constitute illegal discrimination.
Your boyfriend can consult a local employment lawyer who specializes in discrimination claims, who will be able to look at all the facts of the matter and let your boyfriend know whether he has a feasible case. Your boyfriend can also file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, who will investigate and determine whether this constituted illegal discrimination.
I don't want to discourage your boyfriend from trying to pursue this, since getting a free consultation with an attorney and filing an EEOC charge will both cost him nothing but time, but it doesn't sound like this is a surefire case of illegal discrimination.
