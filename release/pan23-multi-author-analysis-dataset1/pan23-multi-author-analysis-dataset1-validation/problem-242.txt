The immediate cause of the creation of the Confederacy and the war was the Presidential election of 1860, but the conflict over slavery's spread to the Western territories had been a political hot button for decades before that. Free labor settlers in the North did not want to economically compete with sprawling slave plantations on the frontier in places like Kansas and Nebraska. Southern planters meanwhile felt that the slave economy needed continued expansion West (or even South, as many wanted to annex Cuba and Central America) to continue its dynamic growth. David Blight goes so far as to formulate what he calls a "Shrinking South" theory, supposing that Southerners feared free labor was going to eclipse and destroy them by the 1850s. Failed measures to compromise in 1850 and 1854 led to the collapse of the Whig Party and the rise of a new anti-slavery party (the Republican Party). Northerners resented being made to enforce the federal Fugitive Slave Act, and the Dred Scott decision by the Supreme Court at the end of the decade ruled that slavery could not be restricted in the Western territories, crystallizing Northern public opinion further behind anti-slavery ideology and the Republican political movement. Furthermore, the failed abolitionist insurrection led by John Brown at Harpers Ferry in 1859 frightened Southerners into believing that Northern anti-slavery sentiment was going to result in more armed attacks on Southern slavery.
Thank you for the answer ! I am also interested in how did the North and South war begin with and what were the motives. Such as did the war begin as they wanted equality or was this more for economic/political reasons? (Sorry if this seems to be a stupid question).
