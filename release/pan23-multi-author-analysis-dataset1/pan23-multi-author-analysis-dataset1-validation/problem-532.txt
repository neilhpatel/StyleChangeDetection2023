The problem in your case is that it sounds like a relatively minor injury and Indiana is not a heavily litigious state when it comes to comp. With accepted injuries, the employer/carrier does have medical control; however, if they failed to report the WC injury to their carrier (and thereby to the State), seek medical treatment as necessary and keep documentation of your visits, mileage, prescription costs, etc. They may eventually redirect your care, and that's ok, but you can make the argument that you sought medical treatment because your employer failed to provide it to you.
Hi Bea! Thank you for your reply. I was weary of the drug screen obviously, and told them that I was not injured. However, my pinkie toe is swelling up and may or may not be broken. I've been such a wreck emotionally about this that I figured I'd rather keep my job then see if my toe was broken and needed care. Thought that if it was just an "incident" and not an "accident" itd be more likely that they wouldn't have to report.
