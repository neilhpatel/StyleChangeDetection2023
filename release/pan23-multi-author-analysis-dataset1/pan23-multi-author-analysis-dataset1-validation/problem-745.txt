Well to begin with, I think we need to unpack al-Ma'arri being an "atheist." "Atheist" is a pretty loaded term, and only recently has the explicit meaning of "believes God/gods don't exist." The etymology of "atheist" comes from the negating prefix "a-" and the word "theos," giving the word the meaning of "someone who goes against God and/or the gods." Thus, early Christians were called atheists by Pagan Romans (even though modern atheists wouldn't call them their kin), because they went against the Roman gods, despite believing in the divine Jesus and Yahweh. Similarly, Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza were called atheists, despite having philosophies that had a place for a God. There's also a similarity in the Indian tradition, where "Hindus" (unpacking this category will get us too off-topic) called people "atheist" not if they disbelieved in God (there were orthodox Hindus who explicitly claimed there is no God or supernatural beings), but if they rejected the Vedas (e.g. Buddhists, Jains).
“Capitalism” in the previous commenter’s context likely refers to a number of specific societal factors: the existence of legally-recognized corporations, as opposed to trade guilds or feudal manors; protections afforded to entrepreneurs to encourage development; and the enshrinement of the free market as a force of good not to be tampered with.
Thank you so much for this spectacular response. You mentioned that there were three possible views of the Quran, the second one being that scripture was untrue but useful to help those who couldn't understand the world through science and philosophy wrap their head around religion.
So, yes. al-Ma'arri can be called an "atheist." He was certainly considered one by many, using this broad definition. A label often associated with him is "zindiq." This word can be translated as "heretic" or "atheist" and was explored in Sarah Stroumsa's influential Freethinkers of Medieval Islam (she translated the word as "freethinkers"). The alleged "zandaqa" were people such as (also called Rhazes), who had this label applied to them. The word initially referred to Manichaens (Manichaeism was regarded very poorly by Islam, Christian Rome, and Zoroastrian Persia), and Manichaens were very clearly people who believed in God.
