I mean, I'd be okay with a criminal investigation if there's a crime that's possibly been committed, but if I found out Tiffany Trump, to pick an adult child of Trump's that was uninvolved in politics, was doing some scummy and/or illegal shit that wasn't a matter of national concern, no, I don't want congress spending their time on that.
