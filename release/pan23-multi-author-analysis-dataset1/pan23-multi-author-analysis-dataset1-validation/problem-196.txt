You should definitely calmly and professionally state the conditions of your employment with your EAD and how it does not make a difference whether you possess that or a Green Card. If they keep giving you issues, tell them that youâ€™ll take them to court.
I understand you don't want to burn bridges or harm your repution but if you absolutely need money now that card that is supposed to be in next month might even take another year, if not having this cash will cause I severe financial strain call the uscis help line to request an expedite based on that (keep in mind the expedite is only for a severe emergency and the may ask for proof you absolutely cannot do without the money).
US has anti slavery law. Not getting paid for any work is against law here (and the main reason some people work with $1 token fee).
Absolutely this. Besides he is a contractor not an employer. Your EAD has nothing to do with the contract you signed. Actually a person can be undocumented immigration wise and still enter a contract.
