Olaf and Biden are bloody cowards. Time and time again they hem and haw and demur and equivocate. Biden from the start has been wringing his hands at doing anything - from stopping transfer of Migs by allies, stopping transfers of s300 anti aircraft batteries ans many other weapon systems all the way back in March of 2022. Germany? Forget about it - they cannot do anything right. Now both refuse to send ranks or even allow others to send them. Cowards - the lot of them. Whatever aid they do offer is calculated to maximize suffering. Enough to counter Russia but not enough for Ukraine to take back its territory. They should make up their mind and either shit or get off the pot. Cowards.
German here, I get that point and all the criticizsm, but we did choose to be peaceful as far as we can, that doesnt mean we wont help by any means, we did so already, but we are very very careful because Our past, I get that it pisses a lot of people off, but I want yall to Keep that in consideration.
That's the thing. Everyone wants Germany to be the ones deciding about tanks. Next thing you know, Republicans block further funding, and suddenly Germany is the warmonger.
