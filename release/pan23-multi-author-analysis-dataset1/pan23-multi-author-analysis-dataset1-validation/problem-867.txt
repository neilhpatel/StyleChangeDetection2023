NAL - I believe you are addressing the current situation that the sellers find themselves in. However, at the time of the listing, the agent had a fiduciary responsibility to only the sellers (representing only the sellers), before the agent took upon the "transaction broker" duties.
But yes your first question is easy to answer. Exact models(albeit brand-new) are going for far more than $430k which is what she is on video saying we can list for. However she hit us with under $400k and said we couldn't do any better. For my street and immediate area, $400k-$500k is the average. We just had some floor damage that we put a $5k sellers concession to cover. Brand new.
When you end this relationship the fiduciary responsibility also ends, but confidentiality does not end.
Not a lawyer. You might consider playing the video for the realtor, and ask her, as your realtor, what she advises you do with this information. It should be amusing if not useful. Your 4 year old will most likely not remember anything about this sad event, but having her in the room when you play the video for the 'realtor' would be an added bonus. (yes, I'm an asshole, but aren't we all?).
If at the time prior to becoming the "transaction broker", she had information that the property was underpriced, then she had a responsibility to inform the sellers. The real question is how far into the "transaction broker" duties - she started to show some favoritism to the buyers. If it was a couple of days - then that begs the question as to their potentially not representing the sellers' interests before starting to act as a "transaction broker".
