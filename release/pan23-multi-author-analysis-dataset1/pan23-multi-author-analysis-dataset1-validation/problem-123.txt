Double jeopardy means you can’t be prosecuted for a crime for which you’ve already been found innocent. The court has already ruled, so the state can’t keep prosecuting you for something you’re innocent of. In some jurisdictions this means forever no matter what (like, even if you confess), in others you can be prosecuted again if a court finds that sufficient new and material evidence has been found that it could affect the outcome of the case.
It doesn't work like that. Once a court has decided on a matter, unless it's APPEALED, that matter is done. Normally, you can appeal a small-claims court to "big boy" court (which might be district court, a court of common pleas, or something else where you are), but that's something usually handled by an attorney. And, based on what you've said, that's not what happened anyway. So, if they do sue, you tell the judge about the previous two times they tried to bring up this claim.
So, (i) they lost their original counter-claim, (ii) they sued you again and lost, and now (iii) they want to try a third time?
