Regarding the incident, the Chinese do not seem take a sophisticated approach (which likely has more mileage in a heavily censored country) and Xi (leader of a "democracy with Chinese characteristics" and completely full of shit) may have just been feigning a belief that "leaks" had occurred (in what appeared to be staged confrontation given the camera--and translator moving out of the way). His lecture and posturing makes little sense in any context if presumed honest. There is straightforward motive for an autocrat to try to establish a pecking order given rapid escalation between the two countries (eg forced divestment of Chinese mining companies in Canada, arrest of alleged Chinese spy, and pronouncement of Chinese interference in Canadian democracy).
Fucking weirdos I swear. People are mad because of Canada's handling of COVID so now they will back anyone who comes up against him. Yep, they don't see any irony in praising a man who locks down entire cities over a single case of covid and completely shuts down any free speech that isn't 100% xi jingping dickriding. Unreal.
I am by far not the biggest fan of Trudeau. Always voted conservatives. That said, I would've make it very tranparent to everyone if someone took a shit in my backyard the same way. Show all my neighbors the video when Johnny takes a dump on my property and the results of our conversation.
