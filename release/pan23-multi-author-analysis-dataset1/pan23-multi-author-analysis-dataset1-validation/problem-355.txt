There has been a great deal of study of just what effect US bombing had on both Japan and Germany; the short form is "less that strategic bombing advocates imagined and had hoped for, but still substantial". It remains controversial as to whether more air resources should have gone to tactical air vs strategic bombing -- eg would you have gotten more net war winning military effect out of 3 P-47s than one B-17 (assuming that the resources required to build and operate one four engine B-17 are roughly equivalent to those required to build and operate three one engine fighter bombers).
Thank you for your response. Despite my title and continued usage of the two terms as seemingly the same entity, I'm well aware of the differences of the two. That is my fault for being careless with the distinction.
For example, during the Second World War, there were attempts to target specific factor inputs like ball bearings that were thought to be critical to the Germans industrial capacity-- this proved less effective than hoped, and its a reason that Sweden produces very good ball bearings to this day.
