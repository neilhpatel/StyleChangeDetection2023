OK, now that I think -- he has gotten a little more ... I don't even know how to describe it ... in the last decade or so. For a while he was on this kick about how the war of 48 was a jihad -- which isn't exactly an earth shattering revelation (secular political leaders in Muslim countries often got religious leaders to sanction military action, so it would have been unusual if it weren't), but it seemed like he was trying to draw a connection between the 48 war being a jihad and contemporary jihadism to suggest that certain parties have always wanted Israel's destruction and can't be trusted.
(Which, I'm not arguing one way or the other, but most of the jihadist groups involved in the conflict today --Aqsa Martyr's Brigade, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard -- didn't exist in '48, so trying to make some sort of big historical link under the banner of "jihadis" seems a bit gratuitous).
Thank you so freakinâ€™ much for this great rec! It seems like the reactions from both Israeli and Palestinian students to reading this book make it less biased than other books.
