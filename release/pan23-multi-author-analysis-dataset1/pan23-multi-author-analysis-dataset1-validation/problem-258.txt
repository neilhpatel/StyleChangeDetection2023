This is a great question I remember just a decade ago, both Barack Obama and John Boehner worked to keep their habit under wraps. Obama quit smoking during his first term in office (mostly), but one Politico profile from 2017 said that Boehner continued to smoke two packs a day Cigarette addiction is a non-partisan affliction.
Hi! Thanks for coming and doing an AMA. This might be a weird one, but I know that some cigarettes were directly marketed to women, like Virginia Slims - did cigarette companies ever directly market brands to market segments based on race or ethnicity?
No! Even though there were many mechanical cigarette rolling machines in use for the production of cigarettes in the late 19th century, cigarettes were not the primary way Americans smoked. Cigarettes were scene as a foreign vice--something that immigrants in big cities did. It took the First World War to "domesticate" the cigarette as the armed services promoted cigarette consumption at the front. It was not until the 1940s that cigarette consumption eclipsed other ways of consuming tobacco.
But this did not mean tobacco smoke went unregulated. A social movement fueled by nonsmokers began to score successes at the local level during the 1970s. Even before there was substantial medical evidence of the harms posed by cigarettes to nonsmokers, anti-tobacco activists scored indoor smoking restrictions passed to protect "nonsmokers' rights.".
I remember reading that cigarettes were originally marketed in the 20's to women as a way to 'rebel' and photos of women smoking were used in an early example of progressive advertising (I'm not sure if that's a real thing, I mean when a brand rides a positive cultural trend to increase its own exposure, for example, Gilette's "Is this the best a man can get" campaign, or sponsoring a float in a Gay pride parade).
Thank you for joining us Professor Milov! One not directly smoking related but activism related question if that's okay:
