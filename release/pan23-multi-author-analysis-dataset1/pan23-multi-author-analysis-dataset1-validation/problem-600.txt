Well ten years ago I was put on probation and I had a very bad image with the police department I was put on probation for five years because I got into it lots of trouble in high school and the police and the judge gave me a misdemeanor and violent because I broke the guy nose three times and he almost died from it because you kept on bullying me I'm scared that the police is not going to believe me because of my record.
This is very difficult to follow for lack of punctuation and paragraph breaks ...among other reasons. You don't need to ask us what you can report to the police, just consult them directly. They are capable of letting you know what you can or cannot pursue. Please get some help. Contact Rainn.org.
