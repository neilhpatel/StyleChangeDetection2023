I admit that it was late about 10-15 times over the course of the entire lease (about 6 years). Now, because my landlord requested a certain type of electronic deposit that took 5 business days to post, the majority of times we paid after the 5th, it was because of holidays or starting the payment process after the 31st.
I’m looking into this as well. I have a friend whose in the exact same situation. Never assessed late fees until the lease ended and asked for security deposit back. His building is one of those 10 unit apartment homes where the landlord is the owner. I was reading a real estate forum and some people were saying that if he didn’t notify you of the fees but continued taking your rent like everything was paid up. It’s presumed that the landlord will give away his right to collect the fee at a later date. Such a shady tactic.
Update: The landlord sent me my check for the full security deposit plus interest (leaving me a note on the check saying "thanks for trashing the apartment") What a dope It's his own damn fault, as we had a leak in a bathroom and the landlord's handyman kept cutting holes in the ceiling and doing a shitty job patching them up. We actually left the house in pretty good shape, except for some broken wood trim in 2 spots and some scratched paint on the wall (ordinary wear and tear). He wanted to charge us 1500 for damages but couldn't charge us shit.
