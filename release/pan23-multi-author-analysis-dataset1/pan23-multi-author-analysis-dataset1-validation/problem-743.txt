Exactly this. Twitter doesn't really offer anything that we needed so why would people be looking for a replacement? It was mildly entertaining, then it wasn't. Its not really a big deal to very many people.
Typical social media hysterics. People say crap that they’re going to do to support their position and then never do. Like “I’m getting rid of my Tesla because Musk is evil”. They either don’t own one or they keep driving it.
Exactly. Twitter is mostly a passive news feed / notification system with a very low barrier to produce content. It's far from essential or even engaging for most people.
I will say this if Twitter indeed survives you best believe these companies are watching and with the oncoming economic downturn diving even worse we might see many companies start going towards not just normal layoffs but instead complete trimming of fat/becoming skeleton crews since Twitter has that issue (cut basically half the staff) and surviving relatively easily.
What? The same people that threaten to leave America for good every 4 years if a Republican wins didn't make good on their threats to delete their Twitter accounts? I'm absolutely shocked. I did not see that coming at all.
