You need to contact a local criminal defense attorney, preferably at a law firm that also handles personal injury cases. You have a couple of weird issues that would require people knowledgeable in both of these areas. One totally pivotal issue is the statute of limitations on a personal injury case in your jurisdiction, if you are within the statute of limitations and suffered damages you could potentially sue the other driver. As a criminal defense attorney, I would love (LOVE) to have a person call me who was convicted of something petty and has new evidence that proves actual innocence. In north carolina, I would assist you with a "motion for appropriate relief" which (in NC at least) can essentially withdraw the prior guilty judgment and allow the case to be resolved as if it was new - this is permissible when new evidence shows that someone who was convicted was actually innocent, which almost never happens.
First off NAL. 3 things here to think about. Any legal judgement, insurance changes, legal liability.
