but these were rare and expensive - the gold-bladed dagger also found with Tutankhamun was likely the cheap-and-nasty companion to this iron dagger. (Iron smelting had been discovered, but had not reached Egypt yet.) Tutankhamun's iron dagger demonstrates that key iron-working technologies, such as hot-forging and forge-welding had been developed. With these, depending on the object, iron can be easier to work with than bronze. Typical Bronze Age bronze alloys need to be cold-forged (and annealed by heating and quenching as they work-harden), and this cold-forging needs more force than hot-forging iron. Bronze had the advantages that it could be cast, and some items were easier to forge (e.g, large thin sheets, or helmets, or breasplates and other plate armour pieces) because it's easier to hand such pieces when cold than hot, and they cool quickly if hot-forging (due to large surface area for their mass).
No. Aluminum is quite easy to melt and cast, it's true, and it's very abundant as an element in minerals. But because it combines with other elements very readily and those compounds are very stable, it does not exist in nature in metallic form and it's very hard to refine. It was not until more was learned about chemistry in the 18th c. that it was thought to exist, and it defied industrial refining until the mid 19th c. , when Frenchman Henri Sainte-Claire Deville came up with a process- and that first required making metallic sodium! Though Napoleon III was very intrigued by the possibility of using the new metal for weapons and armor, even then it was far too expensive, worth more than gold by weight..
