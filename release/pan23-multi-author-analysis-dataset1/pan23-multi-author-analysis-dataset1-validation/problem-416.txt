In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Now? Well now that mentality isn’t as prevalent, hell look at how many crazy MAGA’s are in the Republican fold at this point (my state elected one in the form of Josh Hawley). That same anger and agitation just isn’t there anymore and the people Trump will do his “alpha male” schtick on aren't reviled or hated, they’re people within the same movement. Most conservatives view DeSantis very favorably so him attacking Ron out of pettiness doesn’t and won’t have the same reception as when he went after Bush, Graham, or Cruz.
No, he can't. Leading into 2016, Trump was the exciting outsider, someone who was going to shake things up. Jeb Bush, on the other hand, had Hillary Clinton energy. It was Jeb's "turn", there was a sense of inevitability about Jeb more than any actual enthusiasm about him. Trump was outrageous, the media ate it up and amplified him for clicks.
