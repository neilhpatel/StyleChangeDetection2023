I am talking here about something very specific - British attempts to control the salt manufacturing industry in Bengal in the late 18th and early 19th century. The British wanted a total monopoly on salt manufacturing and trade. They basically created a system by which they determined how much salt would be manufactured in Bengal every year and then they would farm out the manufacturing contracts to various manufacturing areas where malangis - poor peasants who manufactured salt on a seasonal basis would manufacture salt from the brackish waters of the rivers of lower Bengal. The malangis would then sell this salt to the British government (actually the government of the East India Company in Calcutta) on the pre-agreed rate and then it would be sold wholesale at British determined rates to Indian traders who would sell it at various retail markets.
What a brilliant bit of history. If certainly sounds as though there is a truly interesting environmental history-themed academic paper to be written here. Someone ought to do it.
Something like 20-40 people are killed every year: a study found that of 822 tiger-caused casualties between 1990 and 2009, 445 happened in West Bengal (where the Sundarbans are located), and a forest officer at Sundarbans (there has been a tiger reserve in the area since 1973) recently estimated that between 2001 and 2021 some 212 people died in tiger attacks. In fairness, he also estimated that some 51 tigers were killed in that same period, which is a fairly substantial number given that the tiger population is only between 80 to 100 individuals (and they are surrounded by more than 14 million humans, with resources for both species under stress from pollution, climate change, cyclones and rising sea levels).
I am afraid I don't know anything about Kutch. Regarding salt production in Bengal, its been years since I saw the old production tables (handwritten by quill pens in old cursive, nightmare to read) but I think annual production quotas for this period was around 200000 to 400000 maunds. Maund is an old Bengali unit of weight roughly equaling around 37 kilograms. In addition to this, there was an import quota for Madras salt (South India, present day Tamil Nadu).
