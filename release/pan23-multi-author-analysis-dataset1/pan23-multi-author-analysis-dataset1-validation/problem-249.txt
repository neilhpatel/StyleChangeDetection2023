Thanks for the response! I feel like there should be something in line because he consented to sleeping with her with the understanding that she was in fact on birth control. I’m unfortunately not surprised that there are no legal actions he can really take, but it feels like a form of assault. They had a clear conversation about how he does not want children. I guess it’s just frustrating. But thanks again .
Others have given you the legal advice but just statistically speaking it almost as possible to get pregnant with an IUD as with condoms (99%) effective, though there is still a possibility. In addition, even if there was a cause of action you’d have to prove that she removed it without his knowledge ajd not that it simply failed, or as can happen (and does frequently) that it fell out or migrated making it ineffective. It is possible that it fell out and she didn’t know - just as an aside.
They absolutely aren’t sleeping together. There were a lot of serious events within the month they were dating so he has been trying to cut her out of his life. He’s blocked her on all social media along with her phone number. They hadn’t talked for nearly a month (even though she tried to by calling his family members, begging them to convince him to come back). She eventually got a new phone number through an app and that is when she said she was pregnant. I believe he had initially been thinking about a restraining order before this pregnancy scare. Although it’s way harder for men to get restraining orders against women from what I’ve read.
