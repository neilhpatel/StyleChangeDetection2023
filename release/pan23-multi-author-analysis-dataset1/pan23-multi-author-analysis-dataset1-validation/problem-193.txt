It's especially funny because there was a reddit thread earlier today where I was reading a bunch of comments from people claiming they're suburban 40 year olds and they're still listening to Cypress hill and Wu Tang. The idea that only gangsters and teenagers listen to that music is sooooo wrong.
Logistics. The only ones in Europe that have m1s are the poles that have 7 training ones expecting the first batch of actual ones in 2024.
Thats disappointing. It more and more looks like West is just interested in both countries bleeding out while showcasing own military products to potential buyers. Meanwhile the ukrainians die.
And it practices using those aircraft in joint operations across all branches, in operations with allies like NATO and non-NATO allies like Japan, and doing all the complex and difficult coordination work to make sure that all of those complicated moving pieces work together every time.
Problem with ATACMS is that they are fucking OLD stuff. We have maybe 600-700 of those, how many are in appropriate working order is unknown to the general public but quite a lot are reserved for upgrades and maintenance. Oh and the production lines have been dismantled since 2007.
The US military has thousands of aircraft that can be used for cargo, hundreds of aircraft that can refuel those aircraft, thousands of fighter aircraft to defend those cargo aircraft, hundreds of radar aircraft that can detect threats to those aircraft, and thousands of reconnaissance aircraft and drones to detect threats the radar aircraft can't see.
If we were actually in this war, we'd have cleared the skies first, and have C-5s delivering massive amounts of materiel to Ukrainian airports and then C-130s and smaller aircraft (which themselves would have been disassembled and delivered by C-5s, you put the smaller, slower aircraft for this inside the first wave of larger cargo aircraft, that is not something I'm making up here's a photo:
[Edit: So they wouldn't do this normally with C-130s, but they absolutely do it with smaller, shorter-range aircraft, and the navy also helps deliver those when possible ]) deliver the stuff the C-5s deliver to unimproved airfields or just empty fields. C-17s are filling any gaps in that system and making regular deliveries themselves.
