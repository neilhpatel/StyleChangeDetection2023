In the Spanish case then a stronger focus was on raw resources to be shipped over; which profited a small group of local elites in Spanish America (esp. Spanish and creole); which meant a system built on highly unjust institutions and accelerating corruption. Whereas the British American case had at least partially transformed product (incl. tobacco or sugar) for export to the metropole; plus by the 17th c. institutions that favored a more democratic development from which not only the elites could profit. I'm also drawing on "Why Nations Fail" by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson here. They sum up some of those points:
There were Europeans who married Indigenous women, but they were incredibly rare - relationships were more likely to be a result of abusing frontier conditions (like starvation or authority) to trade for sexual favours, or outright ownership as (illegal) domestic slaves. This led to much of Aboriginal Australia having mixed ancestry, which was measured by white society to determine what rights the individual deserved - for instance, in some states someone with 'a quarter' of Aboriginal ancestry might be classified as fully white, fully Aboriginal, or somewhere in between, and thus might have their right to marry, travel, work, vote, etc. revoked. The abuse of Aboriginal women was so common that segregation via reserves and missions was partly aimed at preventing sexual relations, and state governments decided to assimilate mixed race children - stealing, re-educating and pushing generations of Aboriginal children into white families and work institutions, an attempt at genocide.
From the earlier answer. Short version: migration of Spanish women was indeed low until ca. the 1530s, with about 1.000 women leaving Spain per year. This can also be connected to the harsh conditions of life in early colonial times, especially during the military campaigns. With an increasing stability at least in the colonial centres and increasing ubranisation, female (but also male) immigration picked up, with ca. 2.900 Spanish women arriving yearly in the Americas between 1500 and 1700.
The combined effects of increased immigration and birth meant that by the late 16th c. Spanish women were much more common in many Spanish American regions - although esp. in border regions were life was harder and in the Portuguese possessions their presence was still more scant. By then the first convents were also built, in part to (as mentioned) provide space for daughter who found no fitting match. Spanish men would marry Spanish women who had migrated or who increasingly had been born overseas - we can see here the beginning of creole society with its own identiy and culture distinct from the metropole. In part this was all still connected to colonial policies encouraging European immigrants to marry.
We can contrast this with less flexibility and intermarriage between ethnic groups in British America, also in connection with the economic reasons I laid out. This differences I would say even increased with hardening racial attitudes towards native people and African Americans (incl. the One Drop Rule) - would be glad for additions on this comparative aspect. I hope the economic, judicial and social difference between both cases I mentioned do make things a bit clearer. We should also keep in mind that despite such major differences, the British and French also looked closely at Spanish policies in order to avoid what they saw as Spanish mistakes.
