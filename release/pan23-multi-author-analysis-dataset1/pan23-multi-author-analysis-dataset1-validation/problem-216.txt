On the direct reasons and the situation that led to Japan allying with Germany and Italy during the Second World War, with contributions from u/Lubyak and u/Starwarsnerd222 should be a good read for you. (Don't forget Lubyak's previous posts on the matter which they link to in that thread.).
" Also I saw some information online that said Japan allied itself against the USA during WW2 because it was afraid that the USA was pushing democracy through the east and eventually to Japan itself, but after Japan lost the war and rebuilt itself its now one of the most Democratic and culturally "western" Asian country's around which is exactly the opposite of what japan wanted and the reason they were enemies with the united states ???

And yes, by 1941, Japan had defeated the Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russian Empire in the Russo-Japanese War, occupied German colonies in World War I, invaded Manchuria in 1931, and launched a full scale and devastating invasion of China in 1937. The Imperial Japanese Navy was the third largest fleet in the world, after the British and the Americans. So, Japan was absolutely capable of being a threat to other nations, and throughout the 1920s and 30s, both Britain and the United States recognised the threat of war with Japan, and planned accordingly.
