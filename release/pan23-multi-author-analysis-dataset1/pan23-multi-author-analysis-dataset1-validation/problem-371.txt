What you're referring to is what is termed syncretism. Roman syncretism evolved quite a lot over the period of the Republic and then into the Empire, but in general, Romans were happy to leave local deities and practices in place so long as they were compatible with their own. This was usually not an issue for polytheistic cults, and gradually, starting in the 2nd century, when the Empire became less and less focused on the actual Roman people (in Italy) and increasingly ruled by emperors drawn from all over its territories, it became even more prevalent. It was a problem for strict monotheistic religions, primarily because of the conflict with the Roman Imperial cult (where emperors, both living and deceased, were viewed as divine beings). The Romans saw the inability to acknowledge the imperial cult as a sign of disloyalty, which is one of the main reasons the Jews had so many conflicts with the Romans through the first and second centuries, resulting in the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD and the Jewish diaspora after the bar Kochba revolt under Hadrian.
Awesome response! Is there also a possibility that those gaulish, greek and roman gods really were gods that shared a common Indo-European ancestor, more or less?
