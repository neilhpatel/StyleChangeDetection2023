Quebec is a strange animal, it has elements of Conservatism that have to do with protecting the french language in a sea of Anglophones in North America and a spirit of Progressiveness in dealing with social issues such as gay and Trans rights, feminism and the absolute equality of women and men or criminal rehabilitation.
I mean everyone cares about money. But there's better and worse ways of going about it. You know what I'm saying.
my impression when visiting it was always that the linguo-cultural conservativism there is also supposed to push against politically conservative anglo-american ideas, and to get into closer contact to the political ideologies of other romance-speaking languages in Europe and the Americas.
That said, I don't see why you care what people do for fun. Some drugs I see as more harmful to society are those prone to addiction or that facilitate violence. Which ironically alcohol falls into. Weed and shrooms are not harmful to society the same way. It's a total waste of time and money hunting those kind of drug offenses. Legalizing weed has brought in tons of tax revenue that can be used to better the country.
