Part of the issue is that the Chinese languages as a group are fairly unique in that they are the only widely used languages to have a symbolic written system. The standard definition for a language is that two tongues are dialects if they are mutually intelligible, and languages if they are not. However, this definition fails for the Chinese languages - because the language is symbolic and not phonetic, the Chinese languages are mutually intelligible when written, but not when spoken.
If we go by the spoken language definition of language, this actually only makes the linguistic situation in China more confusing rather than to help us to better understand the Han people. The spoken languages of southern China are one of the classic examples of what is called a dialect continuum, in which languages of adjacent regions are mutually intelligible but as you cover larger distances, the differences accumulate and languages gradually become unintelligible. As a result, there is really no sensible way to divide these into linguistically distinct "languages" in which each group consists of mutually intelligible dialects and each language is mutually unintelligible with each other. Chinese scholars have a traditional classification, but partly because of the fact that it is not a clean classification, people do not really strongly identify with the language/dialect they have been classified into. Moreover, similar phenomena exist with other cultural differences like cuisine.
But your post seems to suggest that the label of Han is the be all and end all of it â€“ and apologies if that's not your intent, but that is how it read to me. It's very fair to say that 'Han' as an overarching label is one that nearly all of those it applies to subscribe to, and that the very continuous nature of how diversity manifests means it is hard to actually label anything below that top-level definition. But continuous differences are still a form of diversity just as a diversity of discrete categories would be.
