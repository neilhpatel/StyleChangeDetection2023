No shit. Corps do not want regulation. If they could have slaves they would. If they could remove safety regulations they would. If they could make children work they would. CORPORATIONS ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS, CORPORATIONS DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU, THE WORLD OR ANYTHING BESIDES NEXT QUARTER'S PROFITS. Fucks sake people. We knew this in the past when they literally paid you in fake money and forced you to work 7 days a week how has everyone just forgotten about this shit. Our rivers used to be on fucking fire.
