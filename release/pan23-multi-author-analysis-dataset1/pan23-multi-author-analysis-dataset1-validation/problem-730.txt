Movement to cities created unique problems for American Indians compared to other ethnic groups. Unlike any other ethnic group within the United States, Native Americans have sovereign political relationships with the federal government. Moving away from their reservation communities and living in multitribal urban communities where Natives were a tiny minority could put a huge strain on political and cultural unity for members of a tribe. Still, urban Natives rose to these challenges by forming pan-Indian groups, such as the All Tribes American Indian Centre in Chicago formed in 1953, the Intertribal Friendship House in Oakland formed in 1955, and the Los Angeles Indian Center founded in 1935.
Makes sense! Indian activism in the latter half of the 20th Century is a particular interest for me, so that's why I happened to notice it, haha. My maternal grandparents were actually at the Fort Lawton Takeover (and were arrested by the MPs after the first incursion on May 8th) and my maternal grandpa was at the Alcatraz Occupation.
