By then, take into account that Lincoln had already written the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation and had read it to his Cabinet, only archiving it because he wanted to issue it after a Union victory, per the recommendation of Secretary of State Seward. So, in the first place, we must dismiss the claim made by many people that this quote shows that Lincoln had no intention of freeing the slaves - he had already resolved to do so when he wrote it. But, and this is a big caveat, it does reflect the fact that Lincoln thought of the Emancipation Proclamation as primarily a military measure for the preservation of the Union, rather than a moral act.
Furthermore, this quote is part of a series of attempts by Lincoln to prepare White public opinion for the idea of a war for Union and Liberty. Large swathes of the Northern population bitterly opposed the idea of fighting for slave emancipation, many soldiers even threatening to resign from the army. By convincing them that emancipation was necessary for the preservation of the Union, Lincoln could maintain their support, vital for the successful prosecution of the war. This strategy worked, as many soldiers and people who once opposed virulently the Proclamation came to regard it as a necessary measure. By the election of 1864, Union soldiers overwhelmingly voted for Lincoln, who ran on a platform that proposed the abolition of slavery through Constitutional amendment, showing their acceptance of emancipation.
Thanks. I'd tried to find an answer myself and came up short, so it's good to have that confirmed even if I'd hoped I was wrong.
James Oakes' Freedom National dedicates its first chapter to examining the development of both the abolitionists' plan for peaceful, constitutional emancipation, and the theories of military emancipation. Highly recommended!
That certainly does sound like Sumner, though. Any suggestions for an analysis of abolitionist military emancipation theory?
This does not mean that Lincoln did not care about slavery or the slaves. He did truly hate slavery, and the policies of the Union Army sought to secure just and humane treatment for the contrabands (escaped slaves), inviting them to flee to the Union lines and "faithfully labor" for wages. But the Emancipation Proclamation could only be legally justified as a military measure. Years ago, abolitionists had developed the legal justification for military emancipation, as an act that allowed the government to emancipate slaves but not touch the institution itself. The prevailing theory was that the Federal government had no power to directly abolish slavery in any state, even if under rebellion since the official position was that the states remained in the Union, but it certainly could emancipate individual slaves.
Operating under this belief, Lincoln could not declare slavery abolished as an institution, neither in the Confederacy nor in the loyal Border States. This does not mean that, as some then and now have charged, Lincoln only emancipated those outside of his reach while leaving everyone else in slavery. Areas of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia were not exempted, and thus around 50,000 slaves were immediately freed. In the Border South, the Proclamation pushed these states towards abolishing slavery themselves, and before the end of the war Louisiana, Missouri, Maryland, West Virginia and Delaware had all done so. The fact that the Proclamation also allowed the enlistment of slaves, whether their owners were rebels or not, also fatally wounded slavery in the Border States - 60% of Black soldiers came from there, and 60% of Kentucky's eligible black males served, thus earning their liberty.
