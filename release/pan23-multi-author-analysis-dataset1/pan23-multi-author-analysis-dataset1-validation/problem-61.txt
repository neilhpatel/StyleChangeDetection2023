Hey, german here. The translations from google are almost correct, however I read over them and made some corrections to maybe make some more sense. Maybe post a picture of the note for a better translation since you seem to have misinterpreted some letters which makes it quite hard to understand and also explains why google had a hard time translating some of it. (This might include some mistakes aswell as some sentences I could not translate since I had to guess some of the words.).
Edit: having read the other translation offered by the other redditor (sorry, would acknowledge but I’m editing this on mobile), I wonder if what you have found are notes made by someone learning to play the organ for liturgical use. I initially formed the impression that it was a letter of admonishment, but perhaps it is more a record of someone intending not to fall into such apparent pitfalls.
Thank you so much! Your translation helped a lot. And I know my copy in German wasnt quite up to par, some letters looked alike and because I dont know German I couldn't figure out the correct spelling. But thank you for working with what i had.
"The organ always appears leading or accompanying (other instruments). Page 39" (I'm not sure what "lütend" is supposed to mean, but it might be "führend" which would translate to "leading").
