I don't think you'll find much argument against the position that the Japanese navy, in most respects, was militarily superior to the USN at the start of World War II. Japan was quite aware it did not have the industrial or financial resources to win a prolonged war against the U.S., which was seen as a potential adversary for most of the interwar period; instead, Japan's navy specifically trained for what we'd now consider asymmetric warfare, becoming proficient in fighting at night, using the then-new technology of airplanes and aircraft carriers, and emphasizing fewer but larger weapons systems that could overwhelm a quantitatively larger opponent. And this worked for them in at least the first six months of the war -- they overran allied (Australian/British/Dutch/American) forces in conquering the Philippines, breaking the Malay Barrier, raiding into the Indian Ocean and driving the British fleet to the far side of the subcontinent, and pushing a defensive perimeter all the way out to New Guinea in the south, Burma in the west and the Gilberts in the east. They lost this momentum after strategic mistakes at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, collectively two battles where all of their fleet carriers were disabled, and the Americans were able to take the strategic initiative with the invasion of the Solomon islands (Guadalcanal being the focus of the struggle), but it was not until 1944 or so when the provided overwhelming force that would eventually win the war.
And really there isnt any way the USN could have had an answer to those 3. Not in any sense, given the realities it operated in during the lead up to war anyway.
