Honestly I don't think you're entirely wrong, the Panther has only been in development for 4-6 years (components since 2016, system level development began in 2018). So far, they've been using the tried-and-tested Leo 2A4 hull, layered in passive armour, reactive armour as well as their modular APS panels on top, so only the turret is really new - and feature like a launcher for loitering munition and such.
That prototype you see in the videos is based on the tried an tested Leo 2A4 hull with mostly off-the-shelve motor, APU and suspension, fitted with three layers of armour: some very conventional, off-the-shelve passive armour, a layer of newly developed ERA, covered with another layer of AMAP-APS panels, also not a new development.
You have good points. But I will say 120mm tank shells have been used effectively to destroy Russian built tanks in the past. While the extra firepower would be nice, I think the added logistical and manufacturing challenges outweigh the advantages. It would be better for Ukraine to not have to add another ammunition size to their logistics system.
