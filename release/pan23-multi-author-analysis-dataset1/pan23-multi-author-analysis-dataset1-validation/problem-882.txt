The very sad thing is, your friend might be right. It’s very possible nothing would be done. Especially in small towns, if your friend isn’t white or if she’s indigenous (I see you’re Canadian) or the fact that she was drunk. A lot of women experience sexual assault/rape and then are traumatized again by being dismissed by law enforcement. Additionally, rape kits are extremely invasive.
However, this is only if your friend wants to do this. Your friend has had a traumatic experience and does not “need” to do anything. I understand that we have things that we think should be done after an assault, but talking to police or getting medical attention can be extremely invasive and re-traumatizing and if your friend just needs to lay in bed and needs your support to just talk then that is what you need to do. Her experience and feelings are what’s most important in this moment. Sorry this is happening to you and your friend.
Get treated IMMEDIATELY. Not only will this protect her health, it is also important to do a rape kit (collecting DNA evidence) before showering and, if possible, even urinating. This window is narrow. She can always decide not to report to the police, but if she declines to get the rape kit done because she'd rather not report, and then decides later that she does want to report, it will be harder.
