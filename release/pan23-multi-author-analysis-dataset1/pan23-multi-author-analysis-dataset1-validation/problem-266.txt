I have question here on this I seen where some were in servitude do we know how this process went. Seen reference to the survivors being listed as Political prisoners and was put into Involuntary Servitude. What this consist of. The Small Amount was said to be sent to Barbados. So do we know the wait from church till sent out to places like these were they transported elsewhere. Do we have evidence of any survivors at the church sight and how their lives were like for different ranks. Some of the stuff I seen and been told about and stories finding not adding up.
I'm particularly interested in those prisoners who reached Massachusetts. Were any of the prisoners that you traced put to work in the Saugus ironworks? If so, do we know how that process worked? Were these individuals with past experience with that sort of work?
Negotiation. Certainly the Scots raised money, quite a lot of money, to be delivered to the officers who were held at Tynemouth Castle. This would have improved their conditions - standard of food etc. But there is nothing to indicate that the ordinary men got anything. There was no negotiation.
