1 June/July of 2023 is correct. She will likely face a lot of scrutiny again by immigration officials, but she would not remain inadmissible under 212(a)(2)(D) for something committed more than 10 years ago. The language of the statute is very clear. She can technically apply for admission again before that date if she seeks and obtains a waiver, but I donâ€™t see why she would need to. Is she trying to visit the U.S. because her boyfriend lives there? Or some urgent family matter? If no, it is much cheaper to just wait. Seeking a waiver for entry before July 2023 only seems worthwhile if she plans to marry a US citizen before then. 2 Nope. 3 This is not true generally speaking because many types of morally turpitudinous behaviors that can render someone inadmissible are considered conditional, not permanent, because they can potentially be waived.
Here's the thing. She could be inadmissible for multiple reasons, each with their own statutory timeline (criminal inadmissibility is indeed a permanent ban iirc but requires a conviction) and a waiver would need to be requested for EACH current inadmissibility.
I believe they made an error. The officer didn't report she also violates INA 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)(Crime Involving Moral Turpitude) when she admitted to the prostitution 6.5 years ago.
