Is that an accurate way to think about them or was that particular reenactor being a tad hyperbolic? Thanks!
Mary, the wife of Robert Mendame, of Duxbury, for using dalliance divers times with Tinsin, an Indian, and after committing the act of uncleanness with him, as by his own confession by several interpreters is made apparent, the bench doth therefore censure the said Mary to be whipped at a cart and tail through the town's streets, and to wear a badge upon her left sleeve during her abroad within this government; and if she shall be found without it abroad, then to be burned in the face with a hot iron; and the said Tinsin, the Indian, to be well whipped with a halter about his neck at the post, because it arose through the allurement and enticement of the said Mary, that he was drawn thereunto.
2. As a descendant of John Billinon, what was going on with the non-Pilgrims on the Mayflower? Did they all understand what they were signing up for?
Newell and Warren both wrote extensively about Massachusetts slavery, with Newell strongly supporting the belief that the legal precedents established in Massachusetts regarding slavery would influence later slave laws in other states, but Native American slavery in Massachusetts is a bit of an odd duck. I'm reading Morgan's American Slavery, American Freedom and found it extremely helpful for understanding what Virginians thought of the idea of liberty, and how that evolved over time.
1. Ah, my poor namesake. He and his sons promptly died during the 1620-21 winter. That John Turner had a daughter who had not come on the Mayflower and eventually settled in the Bay Colony. My own father did emigrate from England on a boat, but a much more comfortable one in the early 1960s.
