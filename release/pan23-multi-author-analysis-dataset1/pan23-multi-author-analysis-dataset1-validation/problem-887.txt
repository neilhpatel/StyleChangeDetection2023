The one lawyer who emailed me back through Homeline said the letter I got seemed normal (it isn't - everybody else who has looked at it agrees it is hostile) and not to pay my rent because they couldn't raise it without notice. Then said let him know if I had anymore questions. (sigh).
Have a really good case with a ton of well documented evidence, preferably a prevailing party attorney fees clause in your legal lease, and be able to prove damages then voila! Contingency lawyers galore.
To be clear, he said to pay your old rent not your new rent, right? Don't pay no rent, unless a lawyer you've retained and who is actively representing you says otherwise.
With respect to an unlawful rental increase, you'd refuse to pay the increase (for one month allowing for the notice period) and then defend if landlord tries to evict anyway.
Location is critical in understanding how much notice you're entitled to, if there are limitations on how much landlord can increase rent, and what landlord can do if this turns into conflict (in most US locations, landlord can give you notice to end the tenancy).
