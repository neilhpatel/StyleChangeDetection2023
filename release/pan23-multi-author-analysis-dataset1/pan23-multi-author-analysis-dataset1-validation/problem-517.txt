Thus, at the beginning of the 21. Century, there were quite a lot of academic degrees in Germany. And some of them actually survived, still, most students today finish their studies with a bachelor or masters degree. And here is why.
In any case, though continued education meant you could specialize in one of the greater fields, such as medicine or law, an abbreviated education in grammar, rhetoric, and logic meant you were still unusually qualified for what will end up being called clerical work.
Let’s jump to the 19. Century. A big jump, but right into a time when significant changes in the world-wide university system have already occurred and, more importantly, are happening. Let’s take a look at the situation in Europe, first. Before the French revolution, all universities in Europe were pretty much the same, teaching pretty much the same curriculum. But then, two university models emerged, which left their impression on almost all universities worldwide.
If you allow me the vast simplification, those two models left their imprint on basically every university system worldwide. Grandes Ècoles were opened in most countries annexed by Napoleon, but especially the Ecole Polytechnique, where engineers were trained, proved to be an international success. In the Germanies, Austria, Hungary and Russia colleges founded in the 18. Century for engineering were transformed in Higher Polytechnical Schools, which nevertheless resembled classic universities in some respects.
TLDR: Clerical work, which sounds like a pun but really isn't. Also, it depends on when you're asking.
To sum up and jump forward: Whereas university studies were pretty much the same everywhere and university degrees universally accepted during the Middle Ages, the long 19th century, aka the age of national states, brought about a number of different university systems in different countries. Albeit influenced predominantly by two university systems, the French and the German model, it is quite appropriate to claim, that each country and each nation developed their own system of higher learning. Next to universities, institutes of higher learning were founded teaching specific disciplines in the military, polytechnic, artistic, medical, agricultural, veterinarian, educational or commercial sciences. (Some numbers: While there had been 143 universities in Europe 1789, there were only 83 in 1815, that is after the French revolution and Napoleon’s wars. In the 1930’s however, next to 200 universities, there were about 300 institutions of higher learning, providing an education with a specific orientation.).
It is therefore universities which provided the courts of Europe with literate, professional, educated men. As the powers of Europe became more administratively centralized, the need for what amounted to bureaucrats increased, especially in England and France. Oxford, Cambridge, and Paris---after Italy's Bologna and Sicily's Salerno (arguably, as Salerno was mostly a medical school)---are among the first universities.
