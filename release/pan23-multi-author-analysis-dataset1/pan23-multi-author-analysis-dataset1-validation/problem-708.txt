I get that. It's a shame Zelensky cant speak to Lukachenko direct and get an accord that Ukraine can attack russia military inside Belarus without making him join forces with putin to attack Ukraine. That is pure fantasy, i know.
The Belarusian military doesn't support Russia's invasion, if Ukraine attacked Belarus then the (Belarusian) military would probably directly help Russia.
They play by their own rules and the world kind of just has to humor them. If we played by their rules NATO troops in Ukrainian uniforms with fresh passports would be flowing into Ukraine by plane and through Poland with their own tanks and weapons and artillery ðŸ¥¸.
Hmmmmmm. No. I am not talking about attacking Belarus or its people and infrastructure. I am asking if the russian forces in Belarus are legitimate military targets.
I get that, but, under the rules of war, if russia invades from Belarus aren't the russian military installations in Belarus legitimate targets?
Does a few targeted strikes against the russian military installations there make putin pull them back from the border to a safer distance?
