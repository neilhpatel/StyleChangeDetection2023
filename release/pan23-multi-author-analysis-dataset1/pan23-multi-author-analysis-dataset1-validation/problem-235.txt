Yes, you could be sued. Use their van if at all possible. Your insurance will likely not cover any damage. Also ask if their insurance would cover the damage (or if they even have insurance at all). Definitely not worth the risk, especially absent a liability waiver.
That makes no sense. They are currently transferring the risk solely onto you instead of using their van. If you were to be involved in an accident, your own insurance would likely deny the claim since you are working at the time and then you alone are on the hook. They have this van but are unwilling to use it and are instead putting you at risk. Run from this place.
Another option could, if other options are not viable, is to ask the company to sign an indemnification agreement where they agree to cover the costs of any lawsuit or judgements against you. May be unlikely that they agree, but is potentially another option.
Absolutely possible. And what's more is the use of "sue me" in your statement. People generally use the term generically in these contexts and really mean pursue your insurance.
