Courts, even small claims courts, are required to have jurisdiction in order to rule on a case. Jurisdiction is comprised of two parts, subject matter jurisdiction, and personal jurisdiction. You can argue subject matter jurisdiction pretty easily, although I'd argue the cause of the breach occurred in CO, not TN. But there's certainly a colorable argument for the TN court to have subject matter jurisdiction. But that still requires personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Unless you're trying to argue the CO person is actually a company with their principal place of business in TN, or incorporated there, or OP is lucky enough to provide personal service when the defendant just happens to be visiting TN, you'd be hard-pressed to present a colorable argument under the 14th Amendment that any TN long-arm statute would be sufficient to give a TN court personal jurisdiction over a CO resident with infrequent and insubstantial contacts with TN.
Only if you sue in superior court. Most states only allow small claims to issue judgements for money. One has to go through the hassle and cost and difficulty of superior court for court orders rather than just monetary judgements.
