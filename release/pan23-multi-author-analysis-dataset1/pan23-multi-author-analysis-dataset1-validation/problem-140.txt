It's also worth considering that sodium ion batteries are coming on strong at the same time lithium is ramping up. Sodium will never have quite the energy density of lithium but for any non-transportation application it will almost certainly be cheaper than lithium and even for some transportation applications it will likely be an attractive alternative to lithium meaning the market for lithium may be more limited than it seemed a few years ago.
Yes they did, not 100% sure maybe a Chinese PRC coroprate project. There are generally horrendous environmental costs, associated with such projects espically in relatively densely populated & compact Serbia. My tuppence contribution is that given it was very small potatoes in the scale of things & given pronounced oppo to it, it was not worth the Chinese PRC expanding too much or any beyond symbolic token political capital to see it through espically given its within Europe & that the blowback if anything went south, would be consequential.
Serbia also bought French jets. And we'd probably buy US arms too if the US was willing to sell, which it's not.
