This theory has been proposed as recently as 2019 by Arnved Nedkvitne, and it's derived primarily from Ívarr Bárðarson's 14th century description of Greenland. When he travelled there, he claimed that only the Eastern Settlement is intact - the Western Settlement was destroyed in an attack by the Inuit. Similarly, Góttskálks annáll claims that "[Inuit] attacked the Greenlanders and slew 18 men and took 2 boys into slavery" [I am replacing "Skrælingar" with "Inuit" because the former is regarded as a slur to the descendants of the Thule people].

Exactly! And on top of that, looking at Storm's edition of the Icelandic Annals, Góttskálks annáll is either damaged or simply has no entries for most of the 15th century, and Oddaverja annáll is the same way - no entries between 1416 and 1427 (the last year in the edition).
Thanks for the response! Did skirmishes happen, even if they weren't the ultimate cause of their demise? If so, what sort of weaponry would both sides be using?
This fits well with the traditional narrative of broader literary activity in Iceland, which is to say that new literary production falls off a cliff until the Reformation, and that includes the annal-keeping practice I'm not.. entirely persuaded by that argument, I think it assumes that only "bad" sagas were being copied in that time, but as far as it goes for the question of Greenland, it's fairly straightforward to claim that the annal-writing tradition is practically defunct by the time any larger upwelling of emigration may have occurred.

Greenland, however, is said in both Eíriks saga rauða and Grænlendinga saga (the two sagas about Vinland, derived from independent oral traditions in Greenland) to have been named deliberately by Erik the Red. "því að hann kvað menn það mjög mundu fýsa þangað ef landið héti vel.".
(Added): I'd also like to add that Icelandic annals that mention the skirmish between the Skraelings and the Greenland Norse is one of the most important contemporary texts for the western part of Scandinavian history (Iceland and Norway) in the 13th and 14th century, so its source value is not so perhaps to be underestimated as a mere hearsay, though I generally agree to /u/sagathain's excellent post above.
Thanks for the comments! I'm glad to see that the population estimate has been pushed down yet again - McGovern's argument that if there was mass emigration then it would have been recorded in some annal tradition has always struck me as fairly weak, and as the population keeps getting pushed down it gets even weaker.
