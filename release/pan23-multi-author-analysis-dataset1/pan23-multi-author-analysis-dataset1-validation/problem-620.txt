In Rick Perlstein's The Invisible Bridge -- a history of the rise of Reagan and national politics in the time period of 1972-1976 -- he tells the story of how the POW-MIA narrative became popular on the American Right in the 70s, and in particular how figures like Ronald Reagan came to promote it. He links it to a a more general political argument that was being made at that time, that America was self-defeating/losing some sense of national pride or greatness. It wasn't that America had lost the war, but rather that politicians, student activists, etc, had not allowed the military to win it. Similarly, the POW-MIA narrative made the argument, implicitly, that the end of the Vietnam War was an indignity that the nation was suffering and that American troops were being abandoned or failed in some way.
Thanks. The question of motives may be beyond the scope of r/Askhistorians, but it seems to be driven by grief and a lack of closure due to the way the Vietnam war ended for the Americans (no one was concerned about secret POW camps still hidden in Germany or Japan after WW2 as the US occupied those countries, of course). The 1970s was also a period of rising distrust in government and disillusionment after the failure in Vietnam and Watergate which also factors in, although I can't prove there is a causal link between those attitudes and the POW conspiracy theory. The actual mistreatment and torture of POWs during the war (most famously, John McCain who faced lifelong disabilities due to torture) probably also contributed to the idea that the Vietnamese would continue holding US prisoners merely out of spite. Once again, hard to prove a causal link but these were all contemporary cultural issues which probably fed the conspiracy theory.
