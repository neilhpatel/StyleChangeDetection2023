You've been given marching orders - they suck and I think they're heavy-handed, but they are what they are. Follow them to the letter. Sooner or later she'll trip herself up. And while HR is playing it safe, they're highly unlikely to take actual action against you based on one person's accusations w/o other corroborating evidence.
3. I know it's tough, but you need to make sure you do everything your management/HR tells you within reason, and you treat this person NO differently than before. Don't ignore her or exclude her or go out of your way to avoid her. She engaged in legally protected activity by making a sexual harassment complaint against you, and if you retaliate in any way (and by retaliate, that means anything that could discourage a reasonable person from filing a complaint), then she may have a legitimate legal case against you/the company, even if her underlying harassment complaint was bogus.
I'm not sure why you have an issue with this. They are providing a clear, indisputable path for you to communicate in front of witnesses at all times and have a written record.
