In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I wish there was one. Because Fox News isn't a broadcast station the FCC has no jurisdiction over it and consumers cannot file complaints. Us plebs have no recourse that I an aware of except to urge changes in the rules governing the FCC that probably haven't changed in 50 years. (IDK, just a stab in the dark there).
I was listening to an episode of Fast Politics the other day, and the host was talking to someone from Media Matters who mentioned that because of the way Fox has structured their carriage contracts (what cable providers like Xfinity pay them to carry the content they produce,) they actually don't need advertisers to be profitable. Making them lose advertisers is a good start, but they'll just keep broadcasting extreme shit. Probably more so once they have nothing to lose.
