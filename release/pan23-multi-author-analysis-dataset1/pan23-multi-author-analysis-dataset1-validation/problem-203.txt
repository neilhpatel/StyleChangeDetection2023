I'm uncomfortable enough with the unchallenged and unanalyzed citation of the above mentioned Campos piece that I'm delaying some of my Veterans' Day obligations because any answer that relies on that as its main source needs a solid and critical reevaluation.
Thank you. I had seen discussion of the Campos article elsewhere on the web and assumed it was a largely accurate expose. Thanks for the fuller picture.
Nor does it go into any detail about how Truman didn't dodge creditors with his government salary as County Judge as much as he juggled and paid them as best he could during those lean years, which isn't quite as remarkable as the fact that Truman could have - as almost all of his political peers in Missouri did - siphoned off part of the Pendergast road contract money for himself and solved all his problems, rather than what he did: awarding them with pretty scrupulous honesty to the occasional annoyance of his corrupt patrons. In an era in Missouri which Governor Stark - generally regarded as not subject to the political bosses as his family money came from orchards (they claimed to have developed the Golden Delicious strain of apples) - had as a matter of routine business taken enough obvious kickbacks so that a Senate investigating committee friendly to Truman found enough graft so that even if Stark defeated Truman in the primary and won the general, he faced an uphill battle even getting seated in the Senate. In Missouri especially, Truman stood largely alone in integrity.
