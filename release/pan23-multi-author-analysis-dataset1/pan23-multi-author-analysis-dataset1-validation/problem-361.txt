So first, I need to explain that television sitcom actors from the 1950s had a wide range of dialects that was a result of their training and/or performance background. Many of the most well-known actors of the period began their careers in theatre, radio, and/or Vaudeville. Those early acting opportunities shaped much of the development of their popular characters and acting styles once they appeared regularly on a television sitcom. Broadly, actors made dialectical choices for their characters that they had been working on and refining for much of their careers. But, you are specifically asking about the "circus carny" sound of men and the strident quality of women in television sitcoms of the 1950s, so I'll try to address that directly.

To quote from one of the removed comments:
