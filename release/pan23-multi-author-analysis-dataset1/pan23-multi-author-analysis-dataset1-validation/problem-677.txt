It is a better description than third world (there is no longer a Soviet Union), developing countries (some of these countries meet the definition of developed), or emerging (purely economic). What term would you use?
Between the brutality of the war on Ukraine, the devastation of its infrastructure, the minimal effort by Swiss companies to leave Russia under sanctions, the cloaking of financial dealings related to Russian assets, the minimal financial aid provided to Ukraine and its neighbours, and the refusal to provide arms and ammunition, Switzerland--the world's wealthiest country per capita--certainly enjoys a certain privilege while ignoring many types of severe war crimes ongoing in real time.
jee somebody's jelly and butthurt. if Switzerland stopped doing business with the Nazis while continuing doing business with the Allies, then that wouldn't really be that neutral, would it? Switzerland also didn't seize any jew gold, as many like to claim. people opened bearer-accounts, which means they could only access the funds if they had the "key" on hand. in return, the assets were protected from the tax-man. those who opened name-accounts got their money back. it's like losing your key and getting upset with the guy who installed the door ffs.
At the other end of the spectrum are four Swiss companies that have not changed their strategy and continue doing business as usual in Russia: the chemicals corporation Ems-Chemie, machinery manufacturer Liebherr, wood processor Swiss Krono and consumer goods trader Zepter.
A fifth category of companies that have either halted new investments or limited their sales but otherwise continue to do business in Russia include eight from Switzerland: among them are pharma giants Roche and Novartis (the sale of medicine is exempt from economic sanctions for humanitarian reasons), food producer Nestlé, and chocolate manufacturer Barry Callebaut. Nestlé, the paper points out, continues to sell a large part of its expansive product range in the country.
