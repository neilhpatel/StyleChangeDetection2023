Secondly, we have noticed that these questions are often phrased to be about people's individual experience but what they are really about is why a certain event is more prominent in popular narratives of history than others.
But anyway. Back to von Neumann. John von Neumann made a lot of fundamental contributions. The importance of some of them were known in his time, though his contributions to quantum physics were (and still are) pretty obscure to non-experts, his contributions to nuclear weapons were highly classified until after his death, and his contributions to modern computing were so far ahead of their time that their impact could only be glimpsed at. He died relatively young. He never did any kind of serious science popularization or public outreach (other than his government service as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission). He is the kind of person you know about if you care about these kinds of scientists but his public profile is and was comparatively low, at least relative to many of his other contemporaries (Oppenheimer, Bohr, Fermi, and even Teller were far more famous).
