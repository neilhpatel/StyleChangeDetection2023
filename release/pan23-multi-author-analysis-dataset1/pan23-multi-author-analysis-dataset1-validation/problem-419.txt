That’s quite interesting. I have a story about a person I know very well. It’s my old friend. I invited him to live in my house while he was dealing with his financial problems. I haven't seen him for a couple of years. From the first week of his presence, I discovered he had changed. He was really strange. Later I felt his behaviour sort of sociopathic. And then he proved my thoughts by saying he wants to kill people. No jokes, for real. I felt like I covered a maniac in my house.
you get people not buying the new harry potter game to not support JK saying that giving her money will only support her transphobic views while also saying that not buying certain products (meat and diary mainly) that harm the environment is useless because these firms will pollute anyway to try justify their own everyday pleasures. They don't care about being consistent with their logic, just want to avoid change.
Seriously? The US did not purposefully target hospitals, maternity wards, day cares, and schools. Nor did they rape children to death and film it and spread it around social media. Nor did the US take their own soldiers and bash their heads in with sledge hammers to scare other soldiers from fleeing.
Apparently not. Anyone that's outraged about Russia's invasion of Ukraine should be equally or more outraged about the USA's actions in the middle east.
