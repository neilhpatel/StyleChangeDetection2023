It's important to stress, I think, that the transition from line to skirmish tactics was not a flick of the switch. If you look at, for example, Napoleonic-era warfare, you find troops moving pretty fluidly between line and skirmish formations to suit the needs of the moment. A good illustrative example that springs to mind personally is the French right wing at the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 21-22 May 1809 (see for reference), which we have a particularly harrowing firsthand account of from then-Sergeant Jean-Roch Coignet of the Guard Grenadiers. (All emphases mine.).
The American skirmishers fighting after Lexinon and Concord were effective in large part because they were fighting a relatively small detachment that had already been beaten and demoralizing by American militia fighting in line formation.
Surely even farther back than that? Caesar would have recognized the basic concepts of command and control at Waterloo (general/legate and staff close to the action, battalion officers and NCOs/cohort centurions at the front with their troops, passing orders by galloper or runner), as well as the tactical formations (a battalion deployed in a close-order line is pretty similar to a cohort arrayed for battle), even if the weapons would be alien to him.
The reason I do this is because of how the game works though. Skirmishers have a higher spotting range, are faster, and tend to be less vulnerable when caught in a dangerous situation i.e. they can quickly retreat with little losses.
The trouble is that the Napoleonic period was one in which loose-order infantry were employed pretty liberally, and while rifle-armed skirmishers achieved particular prominence, ordinary musket-armed troops were also regularly expected to be able to go into extended order as needed. This had precedents going back before the era of the JÃ¤ger rifle. We have accounts of contingents of light infantry being used in European land battles well before Napoleon, such as Grassin's Legion at Fontenoy in 1745, or the Pandours employed by the Austrians as early as 1740 and used to great effect during the Seven Years' War. The growth in the use of light infantry and light infantry tactics is, even in older historiography like Chandler's The Art of Warfare in the Age of Marlborough (1976), recognised as being a phenomenon of the latter half or so of the eighteenth century, from the age of the musket rather than of the rifle.
Just to highlight the fluidity aspect a bit further, one of the most noted light infantry formations of the Napoleonic period was of course the 95th Regiment of Foot (Rifles) in the British army, a force of rifle-armed troops that were distributed as the army's specialist skirmisher force, though also functioning alongside faster-firing, musket-armed light infantry contingents. During most of the Napoleonic Wars, particularly in the Peninsular War of 1808-14, the Rifles fought as skirmishers, but there were exceptions. Notably, at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 the Rifles actually fought in line at several points. Lieutenant Colonel William Eeles of the 95th, a captain in the 3rd Battalion (part of the 3rd Brigade) at the battle, had this to say in a letter recalling his experiences in 1834:
