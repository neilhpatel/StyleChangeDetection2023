Yea, them saying the CFO didn't have the authority to begin with is a joke. My company has 42,000 employees so its not some small shop. I'm in a unique role where I bypass many layers of management in the reporting structure. I mean, I could somewhat understand if HR told me my Director didn't have the authority, but the company CFO!?
His story of "(1) CFO approved your raise and (2) CFO now says he lacks authority to give you the raise" really makes the CFO look bad and perhaps the CFO would disagree that 1 or 2 or both ever happened and would not be pleased that the Director invokes the CFO's name when making promises and when reneging on promises.
Or perhaps he got it approved by the CFO but Director now regrets giving you the raise and wants to cut salary in his department, so he's revoking the raise and blaming the CFO.
Is it possible your Director isn't being truthful when he says the CFO approved this or that the CEO is now saying he/she doesn't have the authority?
Unfortunately yes. It may be different if you, say had an offer in hand, and decided to turn down that offer based on your employers promise.
