get the money, then use some of it to pay for ads next election season: "DeSantis wasted your tax money that is paying for this ad. Cut the waste, Cut DeSantis.".
The violent mob was only one half of the Jan6 insurrection; the equally dangerous half was the "mainstream" Republican legislators who voted to decertify Biden electoral votes for no reason other than that they didn't like the results. And two years later, 51%-52% of voters chose that party, even after it expelled most people who denounced Trump's attempt to overturn the election. The attitude "Democracy isn't going anywhere anytime soon" is like saying "sure, I had a minor heart attack, but I don't need to worry about my health because it was my first heart attack and I survived". Democracies end all the time, and the US isn't special in that regard. If we want to pass the robust secular democracy we inherited onto our descendants, we have to work for it.
