Like other people said, check credit reports, life insurance policies, but the biggest thing is SEE IF A DEATH CERTIFICATE WAS FILED. I looked it up, and it was said that death certificates do have SSNs listed on them. That can cause issues for multiple things, such as unemployment claims or taxes if you file jointly or she files separately for example. You said your wife visited that state- Did she ever lose any vital identity documents there? Good luck.
Meh, all I can really point out here is that, while the obit phrasing does sound generic --almost like it could be an automatically generated blip based off the site's calculations of your wife's age and the lack of input from family and friends-- they've only used it for her. I originally thought that maybe the site uses bots to crawl the internet and gather information about deaths and just made a mistake, but all the obits I looked at were at least personalized. That doesn't mean a bot couldn't have scraped the obits from other websites, I suppose. At any rate, your wife should Google her name and check her credit report for evidence that someone has been using her identity. She can also check her social security earnings record by following the steps on page.
