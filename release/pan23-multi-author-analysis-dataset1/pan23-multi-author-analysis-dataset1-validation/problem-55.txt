To understand this question we have to take a step back to the 1950s. Black artists of the time were struggling to break into mainstream popularity, more specifically a white fanbase. Simply put, there was an identity crisis. Black music was still largely divided into the 3 impulses of blues, gospel, and jazz, each with a distinctive style and fanbase. To break into a wider market, black artists would have to combine these styles and hope for the best. Ray Charles was one of these artists who attempted to do so, but by putting secular lyrics over gospel tunes, he faced severe backlash from the black community, but did attract whiter audiences. Keep in mind too the white community during the late 1950s cast rock and roll as "devil's music." But before rock developed, rising black artists were found in doo-wop and took a Booker T. Washinon-ish approach of reforming their image to break into a white market. Groups like the Drifters, the Platters, and the Ink Spots wore suits and ties, annunciated words properly, and sang tame lyrics. This approach worked. Many of these black doo-wop groups found mainstream success, mostly due to the fact that listeners could not tell whether the artists were white or black while listening over the radio. But as rock and roll emerged, a lot of them lost out to whites (ironically) acting more black. Elvis Presley noted that stylistically one of his favorite singers was Clyde McPhatter of the Drifters. Out of the second generation of rock, only two artists were black: Chuck Berry and Little Richard, yet during their breakthrough into a national, interracial fanbase, Berry was arrested for prostitution and Richard left rock to return to the church (reflecting on the black community's popular identity crisis).
This part makes sense to me. I guess I was curious what made the overt blackness of Gangsta rap suddenly popular with listeners, where it seemingly had been somewhat anathema before. I suppose musical trends often don't seem to have a rhyme or reason, so there may not be a satisfying explanation.
