In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Well, yeah. That's true of all social institutions though. Like Thomas Jefferson said, "laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind.".
One shouldn’t have to be religious or have a religiously-sanctioned relationship to enjoy benefits and protections offered by the government, which under the establishment clause can’t discriminate or provide preferential treatment to a specific individual based on their religion.
How so? I could see under the pre-20th century interpretation in which the right to contract was seen as largely inviolable, with marriage being a contract and all, but since the 20th century the right to contract has largely been eroded. Also how would that apply before the doctrine of incorporation in the 20th century? Under what provision would the right to marriage be constitutionally protected?

I can certainly see how the Constitution has always protect gay marriage against a Congressional act prohibiting gay marriage, as the Constitution does not grant Congress any authority over matters of marriage or contract, and I don't even think the pretzel logic of Wickard could justify marriage contracts as being interstate commerce, not to mention the protections of the 9th amendment on all matters not delegated to Congress being reserved by the people against the Congress.
