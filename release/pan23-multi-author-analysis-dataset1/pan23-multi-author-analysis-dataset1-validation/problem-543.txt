Prior to 1920, there wasn't a consistent process for drafting the annual spending bills. Originally the Ways and Means Committee would write a single appropriations bill to fund the entire government for the year (so technically an omnibus in the sense that it funded everything, but on a much smaller scale), but as federal spending increased, the workload became more than Ways and Means could deal with in addition to their other responsibilities. The House created a dedicated Appropriations Committee in 1865 with responsibility for crafting the spending bills, but you still get some spending bills coming from the relevant authorizing committees. The spending bills in this time period were more issue focused than the agency focus we see today. You'd have one bill that funded salaries and working expenses for all of the agencies, one bill that funded all projects related to rivers and harbors, one bill that funded all military activities, and my personal favorite - the Sundry Civil bill, which funded all of the domestic programs that didn't fit neatly into another bill.
Thanks for this answer! I'm curious what your sources were. I see you cited something in text, but didn't list the full reference. Could you please provide these?
