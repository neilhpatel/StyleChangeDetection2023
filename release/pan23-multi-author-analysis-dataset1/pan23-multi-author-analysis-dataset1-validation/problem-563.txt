But unfortunately we are still holding our collective nato shvances in our hands when it comes to hypersonic which is an actual game changer.
Maintaining nuclear devices is incredibly expensive. Judging by i Russia's military performance over the last year, I'm guessing they are non functioning.
Obviously not. but then, what part of the failed Jan 6th coup in the USA do you ascribe to Putin? He and his agents were sowing violent strife for years.
Russian nationalists absolutely love "Kiev". If you don't know that then you aren't paying attention. In their eyes it's the mother of Russian cities. Wiping out Ukraines government is a stated goal of their operation. Biden just stopped by and gave them a hug.
I’d give US and NATO the upper hand in conflict as they are a much more professional military with JAOC2C abilities that simply have not been seen by Russia and until proven otherwise (aka a conflict) China is a party army. (That’s not to under estimate them, you can’t measure something that hasn’t been active in real world combat).
