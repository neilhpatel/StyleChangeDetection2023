However, I have complete faith in the utter shittyness of the fascists holding this up. It's entirely possible that they could collude to have enough of them vote 'present' to spite/scare McCarthy and fuck up their math in a way where Jeffries accidentally wins.
I'm currently dreaming of a vote where the Freedumbers all vote 'present' to spite McCarthy and don't realize they are putting Jeffries in as Speaker by doing so.
I'm actually starting to hope that the Freedumb fascists unintentionally put Jeffries in by having enough of them vote 'present' and fucking up their count in one of these votes. They clearly aren't voting for anyone at this point. There is lterally nobody else that can win the position right now besides Jeffries. All it will take is some angry asshat electoral math fuckup. I'm pretty sure that scenario isn't outside the realm of possibility at this point.
