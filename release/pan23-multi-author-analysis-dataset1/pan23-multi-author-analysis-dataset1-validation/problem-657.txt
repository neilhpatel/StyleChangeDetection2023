Edit: sounds like they have completely separate porches. Still doesn't meet threshold for wiretapping, though. He can take it off the wall though.
Because they don’t live they and they are putting their property onto yours I’d take it down and put it on their own porch with a note (take a picture of the note too) stating they can’t put their personal property onto yours and that the next time they do this you’re gonna assume that it’s a gift and you’ll do with it as you please.
Take it down. It’s been affixed to your property without your or your landlords knowledge or consent and can be considered illegal monitoring of your personal property and business. Also file a police report for this reason.
Carefully remove. Take to police station saying you found this installed, get an informational report. If someone comes looking say how great it is they remembered where they mistakenly placed it. They are in luck as you brought it to the police station so they could properly reclaim their lost property.
