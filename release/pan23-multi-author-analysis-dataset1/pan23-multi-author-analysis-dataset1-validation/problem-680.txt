In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
No. As long as they trigger the libs, pretend to be religious, and feed the grievance and outrage content streams, they can do anything they want. Republican voters donâ€™t care. Republican voters want everyone else but them to be angry and suffer. The Cruelty Is The Point.
Also, immigration? The immigration system wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for policies in Latin America that has led to destabilized countries, which both Republicans and Democrats have played a hand in. Republicans haven't even mentioned once a pathway to citizenship for immigrants. I have a friend who's been waiting for citizenship status for a decade. He's paid taxes and everything. What is the Republican plan to help create a pathway to citizenship? They only talk about immigrants like they're demons, without realizing a majority of immigrants have been here for almost a decade now.

Plus, Republicans have perpetuated an immigration black hole that encourages illegal immigration while simultaneously arguing against every measure that could fix it.
They must be fought with this in mind. There are no unfair tactics only unjust targets. Republicans consider any Democratic supporter an enemy to be removed by any means at their disposal. They must be fought and defeated the same way. Democrats make the mistake of bringing logic to a feelings fight far too often.
