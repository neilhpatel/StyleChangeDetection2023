Yes, but its not the same. If you live in the U.S. (which I do) count your blessings. It's not until you visit Nigeria that you realize the vast amount of poverty versus the very few elite living, for example, on Banana Island. There is even more of a contrast in the North (Kano).
I don’t have a prophet I follow, they all failed and became blasphemous farces through the writings of following psychopaths telling the people the lies they want to believe, and that lie is "I will make you wealthy, I will take care of you, and we’ll make them pay, and we’ll make them suffer for it. No let’s go slaughter their men an take their women and children as our slaves." 10,000 years of war and slavery, and we blame Allah, or God, or Chaos, or whatever, anything but our own I just follow Allah directly.
Will humanity ever choose to quit defying Allah and give up this 10,000 year old economy based in Human Suffering? Every religion, every revolution the same. Allah tries to get people to give up war and slavery as the basis of our growth, and every single time we twist His words into Blasphemy and continue killing and torturing other people. , we choose to live our own truth, one of taking our ability to create anything we desire, and we choose to create human suffering for profit. Allah has already made sure we created a fully funded replacement economy that allows everyone to live comfortably while obeying His only requirement ever for us, “Be kind and take care of each other.”.
They don't have to though. It isn't necessary to improve the lives of your citizens to drill oil, so they just keep it for themselves or let the oil companies keep most of it.
