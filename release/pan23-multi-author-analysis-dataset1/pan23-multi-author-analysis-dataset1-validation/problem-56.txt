A ton of the people that Republicans have vomited all over the federal courts are literally unqualified, they were grown in the federalist society lab and boosted up onto the federal bench so they could pretend to be judges, undermine rule of law and cater to delusional conservative nonsense.
It's not as bad as it sounds. Of the 20, 18-19 are fairly safe based on voting records. Most of them are up in the North East. Honestly, Ohio, Montana, and maybe Pennsylvania are the only ones that might truly be difficult to defend. There is also Arizona, which like Georgia, has shown itself capable of getting out to vote for democrats for the past two elections now. And not that it matters yet, but I genuinely thing Susan Collins is done this time in Maine. Roe v. Wade is going to be too much for her to win again.
