In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Interesting. Where did "in god we trust" and all of our other religious based ideology get implemented then? Also, what is the reason that freedom of religion made its way into the first amendment? I have no stance (or religion) here, just curious about this.
Exactly. They’re going to have a hell of time making it so something like an architectural firm can’t legally discriminate against black people or Jewish people. Or maybe that’s what they want and they’ll overturn some civil rights legislation as unconstitutional.
Really. Really. This bullshit again. Can’t these religious creeps just go crawl away and let the rest of us normal humans live? These religious nuts seriously need to go away. You are EXHAUSTING.
