Typical, actually. Republicans are SIXTEEN TIMES more likely than ANY other demographic to be involved in the sexual assault/ murder of a child. That’s a statistical FACT look it up.

Remember Anthony Weiner? Do you guys remember how all of his evidence was posted for the world to see? Where the fuck is the evidence that proves that she actually committed these crimes? This isn’t in her defense because I have about as much information or less as the article but when the article resorts to hearsay and the hearsay is just giving a general answer then what do you expect the reader to believe? I mean if you were to say that happened a long time ago and I also won money that doesn’t sound like something an innocent person would say. If you were innocent you would just say it and then accuse people of lying, but she didn’t claim innocence. I don’t know if this article is even accurate if they are using hearsay and gossip as evidence.
