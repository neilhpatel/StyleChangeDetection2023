While it is true that Muslim scholars (whether Arab, Persian, or otherwise), helped preserve many of the classical Greek texts, they did not do so by translating them. In fact Muslim scholars could not translate them. The whole reason for the translation of Greek texts into Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age was not for the purpose of preserving them. It was because Muslim scholars could not read Greek or Latin, and were therefore totally unable to understand the texts they had acquired unless they were translated.
Since they could not read the Greek texts themselves, Muslim scholars paid Christian and Jewish scholars to translate these works into Arabic for them. Unlike the Muslim scholars for whom they were translating, Christian and Jewish scholars were typically literate not only in their native language but also in Greek, Latin, and Arabic, and sometimes in additional languages such as Hebrew or Syriac.
Franz Rosenthal, who was the Sterling Professor Emeritus of Arabic at Yale University, noted that the famous ninth and tenth century Muslim commentators on the Greek texts, did not actually know how to read or write either Greek or Syriac. \[23\] Peter Adamson, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Munich, writes "When philosophers like Avicenna and Averroes read Aristotle, it was never in Greek - a language of which they were ignorant". \[24\].
A follow-up question if you don't mind - how did this Christian enthusiasm for Neo-Platonism and Greek philosophy in general reconcile itself with some of the more virulently anti-pagan tendencies within Christianity which were seen during the time of the Emperor Theodosius for example?
1. Arab translations didn't reach Latin Europe until relatively late; the last quarter of the twelfth century. By this time Western scholars had recovered most of the classical tradition themselves, directly from Greek texts. When they did come across Arab translations, they typically found they were inferior to the Latin translations they already had, which were directly from the Greek.
Very few of the Greek texts were actually returned to the West via the Arabic translations. Although almost all of the Aristotelian corpus was available to Muslim scholars by the end of the tenth century, hardly any of it was transferred to the West through Arabic; Western scholars recovered almost all of it themselves, through Greek texts.
As I noted previously, during the Twelfth Century Renaissance, Western scholars were recovering the classical intellectual tradition from the Greek, not via the Arabic. For example, by the end of the twelfth century Western scholars had recovered almost all of Aristotle from Greek texts transported from the East.\[29\].
By the end of the twelfth century Western scholars had recovered almost all of Aristotle from Greek texts transported from the East.\[22\] During the twelfth century, Burgundio of Pisa and James of Venice lived in Constantinople, and translated many of the works of Aristotle, directly from the Greek. These texts were then sent West. During the same time, Henricus Aristippus translated works by Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Proclus, and Ptolemy from Greek texts sent to the king of Sicily by the Byzantine emperor.
Still in the twelfth century, Henricus Aristippus in Sicily supervised the translation into Latin of works by Plato, Euclid, and Ptolemy. Reynolds and Wilson mention that “Aristippus himself translated Plato's Phaedo and Meno, some works of Aristotle, and perhaps Hero's Pneumatica, which discusses steam-engines, 'penny-in-the-slot' machines, and other gadgets”. \[12\].
Also, in history textbooks, I do not agree with the use of broad umbrella terms such as "Islamic Empires" and the "Islamic Golden Age" since they had varying governance structures, ethnicities, etc that easily differentiated them from each other. The commonality was Islam as the main religion but in a loose way. In particular, different ethnicities practiced and still practice Islam today differently due to varying schools of thought.
