Formed in 1944 by Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso to negotiate terms for a negotiated peace to the war, efforts to negotiate any terms such as the retainment of conquered territory in China and Southeast Asia were immediately fruitless, namely because of the Allied agreement of only accepting the unconditional surrender of any Axis Power during the Casablanca Conference in 1943.
Wierd to think about though... Especially when certain leaders of today are a bit... well... too talkative towards the public. Not mentioning any names or countries, of course.
While the Counsel Hardliners vehemently opposed surrender in any capacity, Foreign Affairs Minister Shigenori Tōgō instructed Naotake Satō, Japan's ambassador to the Soviet Union, to solicit Soviet support in mediating a peace conference between the Allied Powers and Japan. Months of back and forth between Satō and the Soviet Union would be exchanged like a broken record. Sato would ask for Soviet mediation to end the conflict, the Soviet response would be vague and non-committal, which in reality was a delaying tactic as the Soviets had no intention of mediating peace, but were intending to invade Japan and join the Allied Effort.
Very interesting read. Can i just ask, why was the Emperors speech unheard of? Did he never speak publically or was it something he said? Or was it just the fact that the japaneese , a proud people who never surrenders actually surrendered?
