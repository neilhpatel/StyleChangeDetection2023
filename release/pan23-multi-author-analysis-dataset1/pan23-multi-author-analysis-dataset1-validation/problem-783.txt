Last Saturday was Pachamama day, the day dedicated to the celebration of Mother Earth, as personified by the Andean deity Pachamama. Many people observe the day by fasting, presenting the soil with different gifts such as coca leaves in the northern parts of Argentina and Bolivia, or with wine and tobacco here in Mendoza; and more importantly for today's trivia, by drinking, mid fasting, three shots of a beverage called carrulim or caña con ruda. For anyone interested in tasting something foul but with a long and symbolic history, you'll need a bottle of caña, an alcoholic beverage similar to rum (distilled from sugar cane juice), some lemon slices and a few leaves of rue herb. Place the lemon slices and rue leaves inside the bottle and let it ferment for a month. The result is honestly awful when it comes to taste, 3/10 wouldn't recommend.
Seeing a good thing, Manischewitz eventually shifted most of its advertising to target the African American community, with advertisements featuring the likes of Sammy Davis Jr and 85% of the magazine advertising budget in 1973 going to Ebony. While it had previously attempted to target a more WASPy clientele, these efforts had generally been unsuccessful and were largely quashed. When in 1968 the company introduced its Cream White Concord, it launched two very different advertising campaigns- one touting its brand name, targeted at the African American community, and one that tried to hide or ignore it, aimed at white consumers. It was much more successful on the African American side, to the point where by 1981 Forbes Magazine recognized that community as the main demographic consuming Manischewitz drinks. While the wine was no longer marketed to a population that would be drinking it at the seder, it still was seen as a kosher, Jewish wine, even when outside a Jewish setting and when marketed to communities that mostly were not Jewish.
In the end, I don't think it's surprising that a company specializing in selling wine to strictly kosher observant Jews was the one that changed the paradigm- these were the people for whom kosher is not a one-time-a-year, traditional concept, but something that is important for all the food they eat, and so innovation and modernization are important. In the end, it was the people who saw kosher wine as a symbol of Judaism and not as a necessary consumer product who held on to the image of kosher wine as being sweet and cloying, preserving it in popular culture even as that no longer quite holds true.
Wine has the dubious distinction of being both one of the most important components of Jewish ritual and also being one of the most complicated food items to make kosher. Traditionally, wine (or grape juice) is used every week for kiddush on Shabbat, not to mention the four cups per person needed for the Passover Seder. Yet, without going into the nitty gritty of kosher laws too much, it generally requires a great deal of oversight when it is made in order to qualify as kosher. The way this has historically worked is that either people who wanted kosher wine would make it themselves, buy it from someone who made it who they trusted, or buy it from someone who made it and whose operation was supervised by a rabbi they trusted. The latter option developed, in the United States and worldwide, into a more sophisticated kosher certification industry.
Anyways. The guaraní people are considered to be one of the most advanced pre-conquista societies when it came to medicinal applications for plants and herbs, and, come what the Gregorian calendar calls August, they would celebrate winter's arrival by fasting and drinking, while fasting, large quantities of herbal beverages designed to ward off spirits and ailments, but mostly to strenhen their immune system against the coming cold, which can be extremely humid in their tropical areas.
So where does Manischewitz come in? While the Manischewitz food company had been founded back in 1888 by Dov Ber Manischewitz as a kosher food manufacturer, it had no role in the wine business- in fact, Manischewitz himself preferred to make raisin wine for personal consumption. It wasn't until the 1920s that Leo Star, George Robinson, and Meyer Robinson founded the Monarch Wine Company to make sacramental wine in upstate New York, in the center of Concord grape territory, and not until the 1930s with repeal of Prohibition that they decided to license Manischewitz's well-loved name in order to help promote their product. Not only that, they decided to use the same team of rabbinical supervisors that Manischewitz used and marketed heavily as the religious, traditional option, with a big Star of David and bearded rabbi on the bottle and the words "wine like mother used to make," a nod back to Prohibition and even earlier, when homemade and raisin wine were popular. Still, it was a long road for Manischewitz to reach true market penetration- many large local stores didn't add it to the shelves until the 1940s, initially preferring the smaller local brands and the Carmel brand from Mandatory Palestine (soon to be Israel).
There was awareness drink could be a problem. The first Emperor of Wu Sun Quan implemented a "do not execute people I tell you to kill when I'm drunk" order after nearly killing scholar Yu Fan over the latter's feigning to be drunk to avoid a toast. The Shu officer Liu Yan, a man from the same village as his Emperor Liu Bei who he had accompanied across China, struggled with drink, failing to keep a promise to stop drinking and seemingly become increasingly unwell and drunk. Eventually he caused scandal by (seemingly falsely) accusing Bei's son and Emperor Liu Shan of sleeping with his wife the beautiful Lady Hu and was executed.
