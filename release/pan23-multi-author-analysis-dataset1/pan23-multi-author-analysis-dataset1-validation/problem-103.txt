Many black citizens were stripped of south african citizenshio during apartheid, with their citizenships transferred to non internstionally recognised 'Bantustans' in formerly South African areas. This was done through the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970.
Really? Have you forgotten all the campaigns that Western nations have done against various nations around the world? You think Israel's actions in its own neighborhood against hostile nations and entities is far worse than what the West has done even in modern times? Please.
Are you calling the newly declared state of Israel in 1948, (who by accepting the UN partition plan, also accepted a Palestinian state be established), that had their neighbouring arab countries declare war against them upon this deceleration, and managed to gain territory in what was a defensive reaction to the declaration of war, the aggressors?
Good. We germans were silent towards everything Israel did for a long time. I am glad my government takes part in this and doesn't let historical guilt stand in the way of what's right.
