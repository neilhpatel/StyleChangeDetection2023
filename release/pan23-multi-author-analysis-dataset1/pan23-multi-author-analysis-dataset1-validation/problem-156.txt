She dosen't need any of your documents. She can contact the city/state where she was originally married and get a copy of the marriage certificate..which should be sufficient to counter the "not married " status on your dad's death certificate.
Why? Most people inherit from their parents unless their parents are indignant. He is your only father to inherit from. Just because his significant other has tried to make you feel weird about it and tell you they are broke, doesn’t mean that’s true. What if, by owning the business, you were able to retire early? Or buy a home? Or have a better life for your future kids? It’s not just you that you should consider, but any potential offspring of yours. There is nothing wrong about inheriting from a father who was absent. You / your mom are legally entitled to his estate, and if he didn’t want your mom to have it he would have gotten divorced. If he didn’t want you to have it, he would have made a will giving it to someone else like his girlfriend. You could be going against his wishes by not inheriting.
