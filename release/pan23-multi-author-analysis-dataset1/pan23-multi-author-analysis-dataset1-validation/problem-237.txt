Two statutes have been enacted to compensate veterans exposed to Agent Orange: the Veterans’ Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-542); and the Agent Orange Act (P.L. 102-4) enacted in 1991. And a class action filed in 1986, Nehmer v. U.S. Veterans’ Administration(3), alleged that veterans' claims for service-related disabilities connected to Agent Orange had been improperly denied. In 1989, the District Court held that the VA had improperly been using too stringent a standard in looking at the statistical correlation between Agent Orange and long-term health implications, and invalidated the VA regulations. The 1991 Agent Orange Act was a result of this case.
This particular bill recognized that a previous VA standard which required film badges worn to show radiation exposure was arbitrary, as the film badges weren't as widely distributed as they should be, and did nothing to measure ingested/inhaled radiation which wrecked utter damage to folk's bodies.

And that the Army didn't know also seems logically consistent with the fact that as far as I'm aware, some of the most heavily contaminated areas are former US bases, and many of the exposed were US personnel. I don't think the Army would intentionally expose its personnel to toxic chemicals just because.
