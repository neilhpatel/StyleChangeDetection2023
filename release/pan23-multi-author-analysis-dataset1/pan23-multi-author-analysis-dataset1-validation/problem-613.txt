I wonder how many of these 200 Millionaires see themselves as Ultra-Rich. If you have 2 Million dollars but half of that money is just because you own your house in California and it's the only asset you have I wouldn't consider you ultra-rich but you're still a millionaire.
Yes! I'm super wealthy but I fucking hate that we have homelessness and poverty. No one wants to have that first mover disadvantage (ie I give away everything and find out no one else does). So MAKE us all give a chunk of it away at once. Not a band-aid. A big old back wax. All at once.
Even the clear thinking millionaire recognises the three ingredients for creating ever compounding wealth is: connections, access to seed money, and expert advice on dealing with the system.
They won't. That's stupid. Every one needs to be in the same boat. Or some people will disadvantage themselves for not much improvement. And now they are just disadvantaged.
