The problem with printing books in Asia is largely a problem of script. Because Chinese and Japanese are semanto-phonetic languages, there are thousands of unique characters in any book. Turning a single character into a printing block is time-consuming, and it's only a net time saver if you expect you will need it many times over. That said, movable type was created, both carved from wood and made of ceramic. Even then, there are simply too many characters--a figure I've seen cited is a quarter million individual blocks--to economically create many different print shops and spread printing the way the Gutenberg process did.
Thanks for this write up! With this explanation, it seems pretty apparent why Gutenberg's achievements in the process of making the type would be preferable over other forms and the language complications also make sense. Seeing as how these are more technical aspects, though, I was curious if you could elaborate more on the historical development of how this method proliferated compared to the impact that moveable type in Asia was having on an international scale?
