So the Protestant Reformation, the one that splintered the western Church that had lasted 1200 years? Was jump-started by, yup, cathedral funding.
The plethora of itinerant bellmakers is actually a really important thing too, since these tradesmen who were highly adept at cast large, complex objects in brass and bronze and iron became, somewhat unsurprisingly, the go to guys for when kings needed a cannon or several constructed at a siege, and remained the principle cannon makers until gunpowder started getting more common in Europe.
Fourth, charity. It was fairly common for guild provisions to (at least in theory) provide the equivalent of disability leave or longer-term sick pay, and possibly even a sort of retirement stipend. Basically, for people who could no longer work.
So if you saw a church dedicated to sant Omobono you would know that the tailors paid for it, if it was dedicated to saint Joseph then probably the carpenters financed it; another possibility was that the church (or more likely a chapel inside) would take the name of the saint whose name the patron beared or would be dedicated to a saint or Virgin Mary to who the patron had some special relation to; so even if nowadays they seem random, when it was being built everyone would have known that person X paid for that.
As for general labourers? Maybe they'd be able to source mostly locally, maybe you'd have people mostly travelling to the site for work, I imagine that depends on the demographics of the town and its surrounding areas in question.
Yeah, no. The Nuremberg guilds tried this one (well, a form of revolt, at least) in 1348-49. (The Black Death had not yet arrived in Germany). The result: the city patriciate abolished guilds. Instead, there was a council-appointed head of the craft. The idea being to limit the artisans' social and political power.
