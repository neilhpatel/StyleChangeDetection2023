so before she imitted herself she told her mother how she was feeling and she told her not to tell any of the doctors there because they'd probably not allow her to have custody of any kids the both of us would ever have, but im wondering if that would even be the case still since ive been in a psych-ward 4 times compared to her 1 time.

My wife was threatening to hurt me dog that I gave back to the animal shelter before either of us went this time and she was even telling me over the phone in the psych ward that she was thinking about hurting my dog because she had a broken wrist thats healing and the dog kept taking her splint away from her and while she was sleeping and resting the dog would shed a lot and honestly it was just an uncomfortable situation for her so i understand the stress in some way. Though i feel like you shouldnt just tell anyone you're going to hurt their dog.
