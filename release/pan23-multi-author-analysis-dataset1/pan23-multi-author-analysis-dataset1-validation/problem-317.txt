‘Songs of the Pixies’ by Samuel Taylor Coleridge appeared in 1796; it is an early example of literary adaptation of folklore about these entities. More importantly, Anna Eliza Kempe Bray (ca. 1790–1883) celebrated south west British pixies in letters to Romantic-era poet Robert Southey, printed in 1836. Two years later, she consolidated her writing in "Traditions, Legends, Superstitions, and Sketches of Devonshire on the Borders of the Tamar and the Tavy," and pixies began a journey as the shared property of the English-speaking world. In 1854, Bray furthered the advance of pixies into popular culture with her children’s book, "A Peep at the Pixies, or Legends of the West.".
it is worth noting that the Scandinavian traditions are extremely imprecise in how they describe and characterize their supernatural beings. the "hidden folk" are sometimes so small that a hundred of them can live in a single stone, and sometimes as large as a mountain (as the four national landvaettir of Iceland are: Olafs saga Tryggvasonar describes them as a giant bull, dragon, eagle, and man). Combined with the imprecise lines between elves and dwarves in the eddic material (svartalfr "dark-elf" is used to describe a dwarf in the Prose Edda), the folkloric traditions can get messy.
However, there is a sign in the later legendary sagas of a folk belief in human-sized elves, much more akin to the Perilous Realm found in some of Tolkien's pre-Hobbit writings. Specifically, Hrolfs saga kraka has a human-sized elf queen, who a certain King Helgi has a daughter with. This daughter, Skuld, eventually kills her half-brother, the titular Hrolfr. Similarly, the Thidreks saga account of the Niflungar gives them elven ancestry, reminiscent of Elrond Half-elven and the kings of Westernesse.
