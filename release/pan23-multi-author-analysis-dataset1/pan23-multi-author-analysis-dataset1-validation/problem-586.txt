In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
That just seals the deal. DeSantis is now officially the undisputed Emperor of Florida, and GOP governors everywhere are going to attempt to emulate him to consolidate their own fiefdoms. Get ready, people, this union is fucked, and the rest of the world probably with it.
Itâ€™s probably just another symptom of extreme gerrymandering. No longer accountable to the voters, legislators are less focused on serving constituents than they are on keeping themselves in power by any means necessary (which makes it easier to line their own pockets). Such a shame that we as a country keep having to learn this lesson the hard way.

DeSantis is continually grandstanding to impress the "conservatives" while in reality he is turning Florida into another Putin Russia. The land mass is just a bit smaller. I don't think there are term limits for the State's governor but I'm sure he would plan on being governor for life should his presidential attempt fail.
