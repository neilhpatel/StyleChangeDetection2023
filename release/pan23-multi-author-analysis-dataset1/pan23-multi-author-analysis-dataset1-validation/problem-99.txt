Finally, during the dissolution, it of course wasn't planned, remember, almost 8/10 Soviet citizens did not want the USSR to collapse. As it was an unplanned dissolution, there was no time nor thought to redrawing borders(furthermore, such an action would have to go through the council of ministers, and the Soviet of nationalities, the legislative bodies, which a.) Had more important things to do at that time, and b.) Would've never voted for something that massively disfavored the AzSSR, as the Soviet of nationalities served as a council to respect equality between all nationalities in the union).
3. Big cities don't usually tend to form along contested borders. Once the Russian Empire started to take some interest in the Caspian and the regions surrounding it in the 17th century, there was a back-and-forth between Iran and Russia for control over the Caspian and surrounding coasts for the better part of tree centuries, until Russia emerged dominant. For most of this time, Astrakhan was the key Russian city on the Caspian, given its location at the mouth of the Volga. It remains a decently large city, and was quite cosmopolitan in its heyday. In 1867, the Russian Empire shifted the base of its Caspian fleet to Baku in order to protect its oil interests there, which diminished the importance of Astrakhan.
