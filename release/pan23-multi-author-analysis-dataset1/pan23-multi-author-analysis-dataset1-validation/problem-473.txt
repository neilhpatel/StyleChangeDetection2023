My best hot take on it, as a non-specialist, is that the Merovingian political system was always highly fragmented, with its multi-king system, meaning there was a high degree of pre-existing regionality to the kingdom. As mentioned, centralization had to be done by force, and required justification and collaboration with the aristocracy. A long period without royal civil war after Clotaire II meant that competition moved down to the non-royal mayoral level. Sorta like when you're playing Crusader Kings as a king, and all your counts and dukes are at war with each other, but they respect you as king. Nominally you're in charge, but the functional skill set of warfare and accompanying resources brought on by successful contests are accumulating under these subleaders, rather than you. And at a certain point, you get a tipping point. And now you're only left with some rois fainéants (weak kings).
The rise of Peppinid/Carolingians had been described there and in other threads, and while it's not easy to assert why they became the leading family in Austrasia (where they were likely importantly landed to begin with), besides what u/y_sengaku advanced (the mastery of shifting trade roads and a particularly close relationship with Austrasian clergy thanks to their familial network) a closeness to one of the traditional sources of Merovingian power that is the dominance over the Germanic peripheral duchies in tribute, manpower and potentially as a source of slaves in a growing exportation to new markets.
So short answer yes. Articles and books continued to be generated at a quick pace over these last 12 years, and likely in the 3 countries/languages involved that "descend" from Merovingia: French, German, and English.
Good point. It takes an especially good regent, or especially charismatic ruler to break out of the child ruler trap. Usually, those below get to a point where it’s easier to openly say, “why the heck am I doing what this child tells me to do??” As a guy in his 40’s, I’d certainly be offended, or at least trying to bend the young regent to my own will.
