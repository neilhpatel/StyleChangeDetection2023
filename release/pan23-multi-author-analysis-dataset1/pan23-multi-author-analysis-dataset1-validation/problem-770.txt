I don't particularly care for the song and I don't play guitar, but I'm a reasonably able chord-based piano player, and I remember looking the song up and finding the chord progression extremely simple. I know chord/note sheets are rarely particularly accurate and often simplified for publication, and maybe I'm biased from having played a bit of jazz, but is the actual song more complicated than mostly repeating the sequence ii-IV-I-V7sus4? And then throwing in a... I forget how it's notated, like VIIb or VI? I mean playing the main chord that's a whole note below the fundamental, e.g. playing a C major in the key of D major.
Elsewhere in the world, Oasis and 'Wonderwall' were less popular, outside of the somewhat-nationalistic, Anglocentric Britpop context of the UK...but still very popular nonetheless. What's The Story sold 4 times platinum in the US (about 4 million copies) - respectable but not quite the sales of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill (16 million copies) in that country. In Australia, What's The Story was the 4th highest selling album of the year. Nonetheless, in 1995, 'Wonderwall' was a song from a very successful album, and a song that, therefore, a lot of people who were at least vaguely interested in pop culture would have heard across the world.
What's The Story's success was propelled by several prominent singles, of which 'Wonderwall' was the biggest. Singles in the UK tend to be bought in the first week and so they debut high, and then rapidly fall out of the charts. 'Some Might Say' (the first single from the album) spent 3 weeks in the top 10. 'Roll With It' spent 4 weeks in the top 10. 'Don't Look Back In Anger' spent 5 weeks in the top 10. 'Wonderwall' spent 11 weeks in the top 10.
