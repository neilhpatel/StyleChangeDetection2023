I have a BA in history with a minor in Gender and Women’s Studies. I was one class from a major that I got screwed out of, but I digress. My husband also has a BA in history with a double major in a social science as well as a minor in African studies. He’s an attorney. I’m an academic librarian.
Finally, (thank you for your help this far!) does this limit my career options to teaching mostly? I’m confident there are more options but I feel with a very specific education (including further education too) the main career would be teaching/research.
Definitely not! Humanities degrees are employable in a number of fields. The most common choices for history majors are teaching, law, and librarian/archives/museum work. Even within all of those fields, there are many career options. Humanities degrees provide a number of what’s called “soft skills” that are widely desired. Think writing, critical thinking, etc versus “hard skills” like computer programming. If you go to graduate schools, you’ll be funneled a little more directly into a given career than with just an undergraduate degree.
