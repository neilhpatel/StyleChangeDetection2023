In both relevant senses of "powerful," yes, this is a non-story. Not only is the amount of remaining radiation fairly small to begin with, being diluted like crazy, and being immediately and harmlessly absorbed by the water it's in, but on top of that tritium decay is also far lower energy (and therefore both less penetrating and less damaging) than most other nuclear decay, to the point where it can't even penetrate human skin in the first place.
True. This disaster is ONLY a disaster because of how localized the material is. It will have essentially 0 effect on the ocean at large.
You are deliberately trying to make it sound dangerous while conveniently ignoring actual radiation doses.
Holy shit, that's not how it works. Super heavy water in your body can under go chemical changes. Swapping bonds with other atoms, and taking the place of hydrogen in various metabolic reactions that take place. Some of them will form bonds and become sugars, proteins and amino acids.
You're arguing dishonestly and cherrypicking a tiny part instead of responding to the actual point - the total radiation dose. Do you know that you have quite a lot of radioactive potassium in your body? Tiny amounts are completely negligible and their effect is included in the radiation dose calculations. That's why I posted them. The target release level is below the food safety maximums set by the WHO, even if you drank the released water without further dilution.
