Well, it was "new" in that, as far as I can tell, I was the first person to open the box, and as far as I can see, all the peripherals are still sealed and the item has the safety tape on it. I plugged in the item, it's panel lit up, and I tested some of the motor functions with the buttons on the front of the device. Without hooking it up to my TV, and spending some time with the device, there is no way to tell if every function is working. I did not open the peripherals, e.g. remote, cables, I just thought I should plug it in. Perhaps that was a mistake as well.
The only way I could see someone truly being held responsible is if they declared it was in perfectly safe condition, but only after taking it apart and doing a crappy DIY soldering job on loose circuitry that an expert would look at and say "damn dude this is dangerous do not plug it into the wall under any circumstances".
I am paranoid. I see thousands of listings on ebay for all sorts of electronic items, and I realize that mine is just one more, but I am afraid that I will get bad luck.
