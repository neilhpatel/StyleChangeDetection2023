I think the premise of your question is off to begin with. Swords weren't rare or necessarily expensive weapons throughout the entirety of the medieval period. While thinking of them as significant investments might work for the time of 8th century England, buying a sword in the high and late medieval periods was not a difficult of expensive process. One receipt from the records of the armory at the Tower of London in the late 14th century shows that 32 swords were purchased from a Flemish merchant at a cost of 2 shillings each, while six "lances of war" cost two shillings and two cents apiece (contrary to the common internet-based assertion that polearms were cheaper than swords). Wills and death records from this period indicate that used or lower quality swords could be purchased at an even cheaper price, sometimes for a few pence. For reference, the usual wage of an archer in this period was six pence per day. These wages do not take into consideration the prospects for loot or random, which could be significant. From these numbers (which are representative in a general sense but should not be taken as universal), we can see that a decent quality fighting sword, one considered worth purchasing by the Crown for war, was only four days worth of wages for archers.
