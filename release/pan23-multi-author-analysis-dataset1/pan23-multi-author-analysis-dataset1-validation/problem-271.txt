Regarding the 1912 election, the major issue that led to the Roosevelt-Taft split was that they roughly speaking represented the progressive and conservative wings of the party respectively (both parties had fairly big proportions of progressives, moderates and conservatives, although these terms also don't really match up to modern political designations anyway). Taft had assumed the Presidency more or less as Roosevelt's successor, but had taken a turn against certain policies Roosevelt had favored, like antitrust positions, and also fired a number of Roosevelt administration officials like head of the Forestry Service Gifford Pinchot.
Taft is relatively unknown even in the US - he was a one term president who had a relatively mixed legacy, and was relatively traditional and overshadowed even at the time by the more "modern" and dynamic Roosevelt.
Theodore Roosevelt was in many ways the first 20th century president to reshape these precedents, and Woodrow Wilson took that further (he was the first president to travel abroad while in office, and the first president since Jefferson to give a speech before Congress), but the American Presidency didn't really cement these changes until Franklin Roosevelt.
Thanks for the excellent reply. I'm British and can honestly say I have never heard of President Taft before! But then there is plenty of UK Prime Ministers I don't know almost anything about, for example - Alex Douglas Home, and loads of them in the 19th and 18th century. It seems leaders always become know for just 1 or 2 things for example this is what I think of regarding the following leaders;.
