However however however however! There are approximately 6,200 undervotes in this race. An undervote is a vote where the voter simply left this election blank OR marked in a faint or small way their intention (think putting a single dot with your ballpoint pen in a scantron bubble or maybe underlining a candidate’s name as opposed to filling out the circle by their name). IF there is a mark or indication which election reviewers can reasonably ascertain, that undervote then becomes a real vote which is then counted. It is important to note that the vast majority of these votes will not result in a change to vote totals and that they are likely blank. I simply point out that these votes exist in case we see further changes in the coming weeks and people wonder where these new votes are being tabulated from.

"The challenger’s strategy was to downplay his Democratic Party affiliation and run on a largely conservative platform in order to tap into GOP disillusionment with Boebert’s polarizing rhetoric and what he called her brand of “angertainment” — a term that he frequently repeated in public appearances and media interviews.".
However however however, nationwide, in the past 20ish years, only 31 races have gone to a recount, with only 3 race results changing as a result of the recount (all 3 of those races were statewide races as well, not a smaller race like a congressional district).
Evidently over the last nearly two decades only 3 races across the country have had their results changed because of a recount and notably all three races were statewide races with larger populations than this congressional district.
