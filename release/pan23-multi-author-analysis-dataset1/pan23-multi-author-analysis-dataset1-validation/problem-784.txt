3nm is a bullshit marketing name. The minimum spacing between wires on "3nm" process is 24nm, the minimum spacing between gates is 48nm. Impressive enough, considering that the wavelenh of the ultraviolet light used to create the circuits is 13nm. The actual density increase vs 5nm is roughy 1.25.
The characteristics of chalom also reflect the theme of Thailand’s host year, “Open, Connect, Balance,” as in open trade (signified in blue), connectivity (pink), and balance (green) under the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economic Model.
For now. Conditions could be different decades from now. Taiwan would be foolish to only rely on America's word and not look out for itself in the long term. We used to have a full defensive alliance with Taiwan and formally recognized them until that was changed under President Carter.
Because ultimately, it's performance. If you can keep the same size but, say, reduce the gate switching time by half, you functionally just have twice the performance for a given number of transistors.
