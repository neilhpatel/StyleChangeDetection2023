I'm curious about your statement that the T4 program was a closely held secret. Wachsmann in KL writes, "Massing gassing of patients from across Germany only ceased in summer 1941, on Hitler's orders, following growing public anxiety about the killings, which had become an open secret." (I also thought I read in KL about German families slowly become aware of how seemingly all infirm / mentally unwell relatives were all prematurely dying in government care and many actively went to retrieve their family members from those centres before they "died".).

Hello, may i write a follow up question? How did this apply to veteran soldiers? Like a soldier goes to the eastern front and returns blinded by artillery shards, will he be euthanized as part of this program? Wouldn’t this kind of action have severe consequences in terms of morale and draft dodging?
