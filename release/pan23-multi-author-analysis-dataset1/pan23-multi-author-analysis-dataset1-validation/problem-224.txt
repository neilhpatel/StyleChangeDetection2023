If you are saying that this only benefits investors, then what is to stop them from investing those dollars overseas - where labor costs are much lower?
I don't disagree with the premise that we should be concerned about a lack of manufacturing jobs in the US - but I do disagree with the point that the world is better off when US taxpayers prop up the Chinese economy. Both sides are not the same.
Realistically, and according to the article, if the manufacturing wasn't sent to China then these new batteries just wouldn't have been made at all because no American businesses wanted to build them. That seems like the bigger issue here - lack of public interest/investment in domestic manufacturing by private enterprise.
Yup. China is the leading producer/installer of all green energy, not just solar panels. They are hell bent on being energy independent. USA could be diplomatic about it. Try and work out some good deals with China. Set up some trade agreements and some contracts. Instead politicians are passing laws to cut off China from selling their green energy tech.
