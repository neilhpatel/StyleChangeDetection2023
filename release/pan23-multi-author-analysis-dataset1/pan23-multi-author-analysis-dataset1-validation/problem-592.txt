So the ideas of the Lion of the North coming to defend liberty, the true (protestant) faith and saving (northern) Europe from the tyranny of Imperial encroachment on the old rights of the Princes of the Empire were peddled far and wide by prints in both text and images, songs and poems to the extent where northern German representatives would come to Sweden to ask for aid in carefully planned and orchestrated events that would help sway the members of the estates parliament for the case of war.
I had no idea about the peasant estates getting a vote. I suppose the stereotypical ‘peasant’ is a barely intelligent sack wearing farm hand like in Monty Python. It’s easy to forget that democratic roots go back a long way, even down to the common man.
Internally, the successes of Wallenstein against the north German Princes and forces of the true (protestant) faith, especially teh victory against Denmark in 1628 and the naming Wallenstein as "Admiral of the North and Baltic Sea" was used as an argument that the Imperials would not be content with enforcing centralised Imperial power in Germany, rather they would not only enforce catholic faith in the Empire, but Wallenstein was to be tasked with building an Imperial fleet (perhaps in cooperation with the Spanish fleet) in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and invade Denmark and Sweden to end protestantism in Europe once and for all. The unity of the papists (catholics) was often brought up as a threat, and that the protestants needed to unite, or fall separately (Americans will know this reasoning from the revolutionary war), with Spain and the Empire being ruled by the same catholic dynasty and Poland-Lithania, the other enemy of Sweden in this era, also being ruled by fervent catholics.
