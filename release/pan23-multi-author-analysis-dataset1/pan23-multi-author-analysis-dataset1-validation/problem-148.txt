We have no evidence of any fraud of the type that you're describing, namely the claiming of state-subsidized grain by those unqualified or who had already collected their 5 modii for the month. No ancient source gives any indication that this happened. We might hypothesize why, since surely such fraud did occur. The most obvious explanation, that the sources simply aren't interested in the behavior of the ordinary people, doesn't hold up precisely because the sources are in fact extremely interested in the state-subsidized grain from the moment of its institution. We're told of one type of fraud--the mass manumission of slaves by wealthy slaveholders prior to Pompey's cura annonae--, so defrauding the state of its grain was a known problem. Considering the great controversy surrounding the passage of the lex Clodia, chief among which was that the state couldn't afford it, it's rather remarkable that "double dipping" by the common man isn't mentioned anywhere ever as a justification for regulating the state distributions. Instead, it's the wealthy who our sources point to as abusing the system.
Interesting. Thanks for the response. Like so many topics, how great it would be to have more concrete evidence. But, I suppose, we should be grateful for the information that we do have, limited though it is.
