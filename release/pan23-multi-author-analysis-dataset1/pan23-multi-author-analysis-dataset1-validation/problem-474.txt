" Unlawful Early Move-Out And Reletting Charge. 10.1 Your Responsibility. You’ll be liable for a reletting charge of $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_804.10\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (not to exceed 85% of the highest monthly rent during the Lease term) if you: (A) fail to move in, or fail to give written move-out notice as required in Par. 23 or 36; (B) move out without paying rent in full for the entire Lease term or renewal period; (C) move out at our demand because of your default; or (D) are judicially evict-ed. The reletting charge is not a cancellation fee and does not release you from your obligations under this Lease. See the next section. ".
If there isn’t an automatic renewal provision, then your lease probably terminates on the final day specified in your agreement (unless you otherwise expressly renewed it) and you can walk away with no issues.
If there is an automatic renewal provision and you haven’t provided the notice to stop the renewal, then it’s a little more complicated. In that case, your lease is most likely renewed for another term and walking away without proper notice would be considered a breach of the lease. That means landlord can go after you. Maybe the best course of action there would be to talk with your landlord/property manager and level with them. Do so as soon as possible. Tell them that you found another place and plan to move out, and see what they say. If they can get another tenant to take your spot, you might be off the hook.
