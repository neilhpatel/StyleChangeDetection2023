I won't do a mini history of Argive politics here, but I will say that it is not straightforward to compare the "power" of Greek cities. In 491, on the eve of the battle of Marathon, Argos would have considered herself one of the foremost cities in Greece: rich in agriculture and horses, with a long, important tradition and important Greek cultural sites within her borders. She compared favorably to the other hoplite armies of the Greeks, save for the Lakedaimonians, and she had a powerful economy. Sparta, on the other hand, was a fearsome military threat on land but was also handicapped by the very domestic situation which enabled her power. Corinth also had a powerful economy, sufficient hoplites, and a powerful fleet. Athens, in 491, was large in land and economy, about average in hoplites for her size, but yet to "awaken" her power (thanks in part to a subsequent discovery of a motherlode of silver in her southern territory at Laurion, which the Athenians famously decided to use to bolster their naval assets).
Yes Thucydides is not for the faint hearted haha. Terry Buckley’a book is excellent, it is academic but works from the ground up, and has a political focus covering both international relations in the Greek world and individual polities - you’ll learn about the rise of Athenian democracy and Sparta’s unique political system, it’s a really good read and like I said it’s primary focus is the ancient sources themselves, which is the core of ancient history as an academic discipline and will hopefully help you move on to the primary sources themselves if you’re still interested in the ancient world. Enjoy!
In classical times Argos was a powerful rival of Sparta for dominance over the Peloponnese, but was eventually shunned by other Greek city-states after remaining neutral during the Greco-Persian Wars.[8.
So to summarise Argos maintained its power by opportunism- they would remain neutral when circumstances demanded, and then form careful alliances with other powerful states when opportunities arose to undermine Spartan control in the Peloponnese - such as Athens and Corinth.
- In 421 BC when a temporary armistice was signed between Athens and Sparta during the Peloponnesian War, many Peloponnesian states such as Corinth were disgruntled at Sparta’s agreement to the treaty with Athens and according to Thucydides sought secret alliance with none other than Argos. This panicked Sparta so much that she temporarily sought Athens as a potentially ally despite fighting a bloody war against them over the last ten years! So another method of Argive power was to attempt to undermine the Peloponnesian alliance when opportunities arose.
I would then characterise Argive geopolitical strategy in the rest of the 5th century as being one of opportunism to regain a foothold in the Peloponnese. This allowed them to survive the tumultuous period relatively unscathed. Then when opportunities arose they would push to regain power. Some examples:
