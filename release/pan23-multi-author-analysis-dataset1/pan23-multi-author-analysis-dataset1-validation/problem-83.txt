By all means, give them the wall if they won't honestly repent, but there's no reason they, or anything like them, needs to exist. Maintaining a system of arbitrary terrorist oppression is bad, and doing it makes you bad-in the causal ascmu h as definitional. Even if you're doing it to the bad guys. Better to just be done with them as a one time thing.
Imho, more so it's the fact that (a) SCOTUS did the investigation itself, instead of giving it to the FBI or some other non-affiliated organization; and (b) importantly, it didn't investigate the Justices themselves or their law clerks, which together were the most likely suspects. It's reasonable for people to conclude that "finding nothing" was the mission all along.
