This is an excellent question and Im super happy you asked it. Because this is actually more or less what I research; this question basically asking what Chinese national identity looked like in the warlord/early Republican period. Im going to break this answer down into two different parts; a brief introduction into how the Han (the ethnic group making up \95% of China, what we call "Chinese" in English) expanded in years past, and then how the borders of China were shaped and justified in the Republican period.
With Mongolia well out of the question by the 1930s, that left two other frontier areas to be disputed, Tibet and Xinjiang, both territories added to China by the Qing, and thus not “historically” Chinese. (Note: By 1920, Manchuria, or the Northeast is decisively Han. While it was once a frontier area in the past, it is considered a core part of China by the elite). Xinjiang had been particularly tough for Chinese management in the past and still to this day does not have a Han ethnic majority. Additionally, it has much less in common with Chinese culture than Tibet of Mongolia. Contemporary governors understood this well:
Got it, thanks! What I'm curious about is whether warlord era Chinese considered themselves to be living through a contemporary version of the Warring States or Three Kingdoms eras, that was destined to end with re-unification as all previous divisions had... or if they saw themselves as living in a qualitatively new and different age.
Woah. This is pretty different from the traditional ideas of "my race superior, yours is not!" There's a lot more nuance and more importantly, justification. Political justification as to why China should be... China. But that leaves the question, what is China? Is China the Ming borders, a dynasty which was ethnically Han, or is it the Qing borders, a dynasty that was not ethnically Han, but Manchu? Does China have a right to exist in the modern world?
