"satisfactory" is going to largely be determined by the customs and usage typical of the area the toilet is found in. In Harrison, NJ, do most people wipe their asses with toilet paper and flush it in the toilet? Does the Harrison, NJ municipal water and sewer works design their public sewage treatment system with the expectation that toilet paper will be regularly flushed by most people using a toilet in the municipality? If so, then that is the expected mode of operation for the toilets, and the systems hooked up to it should be considered capable for performing in the manner typically expected in that area.
NAL. . As of 163-3, section G, "No residential unit shall be offered for rental unless the following systems are in satisfactory operating order: ... The plumbing system, including domestic water, or public sewage and potable water supply.".
However, based on standards in Harrison, NJ, USA, the failure of the plumbing system to handle paper products designed for flushing (example, 1 ply toilet paper), is definitely from my understanding, something that constitutes a malfunction.
