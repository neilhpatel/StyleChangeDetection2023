You need a divorce lawyer that also handles non-divorce cases. There are a lot of legal issues here. For example, even though your MIL bought the house you live in, you may have a constructive trust over it for your role in upkeep, maintenance, and funds paid to it. You may also have a conversion claim against the MIL who took the 25k. Some states, like Texas, have “automatic orders” or “standing orders” when a divorce is filed/served or when it is clear that one is imminent. I’m not sure what you mean by “I asked for the divorce” if you mean filing or informality, but transferring any assets or money after the D word can allow for a reversion (and sometimes other penalties to the party carrying out those actions). You’d need to commence an action and get a judge, with your lawyer, to help resolve these issues. But just know, generally, you will have no jurisdiction over the MIL in a divorce action which is why you’d need to likely commence two actions—hence the recommendation to get a more well rounded lawyer and not just a pure divorce lawyer.
Thank you so much! She's being a bully and I am trying to get all of my and my daughters stuff together ASAP. She and my ex are making it impossible to do this peacefully. My daughter is in AZ spending time with her BFF and doesn't have to witness this.
