My account was banned after a week of it being up for actually no reason, which was very likely done on purpose cause what I sold is very over saturated on Etsy, and I found online other people selling the same item as me who experienced the same thing. Basically I had to go digging in youtube to find a special email to get it confirmed that my account was taken down for no reason and put back up. When your account is banned they don’t provide with any way to challenge it and the email on their website doesn’t work. Lol.
But, if we assume it is copyright eligible and the agreement was clean with no issues (a big assumption), the quickest and cheapest way to deal with this is to file a DMCA takedown with Etsy and the web host for the website. Etsy is an American company and the DMCA should be straightforward there. They will disable the ring and it will no longer be able to be sold on their site. The personal website of the seller may be a bit more complicated because of the international aspect but if the web host is an American company, it should operate just like Etsy and will remove the item. You can find out what entity is hosting a website by typing it into most host checker sites.
