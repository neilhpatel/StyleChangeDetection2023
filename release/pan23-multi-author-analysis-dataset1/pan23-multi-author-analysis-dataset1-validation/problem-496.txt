This is why they use the term illegitimate. They are literally signaling that they view every vote not for the GOP as illegitimate. You better believe if they could they would codify that in law. Believe the fascist when they tell you who they are through "jokes.".
This is also why people are mistaken to believe that Cheney running against Donald Trump in 2024 would hurt the Democrat's chances -- it's complete self-denial to believe that the sort of voter that is highly likely to pick Liz Cheney on a ballot would have otherwise been inclined to vote for a Democrat. The media environment has made most of these voters unreachable, and it's a far more efficient strategy to toss them a bone so they can vote their conscience and at the same time, not do damage by doing so.
I am not so sure about that. The race was extremely close. Even a very small amount of Republicans who decided to listen to people like Cheney could be said to be the impactful straw that broke the camels back. Obviously the same can be said of everything else that was necessary, but the point still stands.
