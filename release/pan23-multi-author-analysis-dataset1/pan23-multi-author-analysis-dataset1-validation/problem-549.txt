It is a far bigger can of worms than most people realise. The problem is that these tv guided torpedos essentially have such low observable radar cross sections that reliable detection of these can be a real problem. I suppose only sonar arrays can reliably pick these up due to the sensistivity of sonar arrays to sounds on water. And civilian boats do not have sonar.
manipulated - highly probable - based on overt smear campaign targeting Tesla with logic bending headlines and gaslighting editorials that attempt to reframe progress into failures, one could only assume SpaceX is equally vulnerable.
How could I say no? I tried to refuse the money he offered me as honor compelled me to take on this noble endeavor in defense of the innocent, but he insisted. Now, I faithfully and diligently speak the truth about the glorious special military operation whenever I have a chance to. The rest, as they say, is my comment history.
SpaceX isn't being stupid, they are being very careful with what they are providing Ukraine because the US is extremely strict when it comes to unregulated arms trafficking and unregulated arms trafficking is exactly what you're asking SpaceX to do seeing how Ukraine has incorporated Starlink terminals for use in suicide drones.
Everyone is getting confused here. The reason why SpaceX is baulking and limiting use here is due to one very specific example. See, Ukraine has directly integrated SpaceX Starlink terminals into the suicide drone itself. The Starlink terminal is part of the weapon, which in this case is effectively a tv guided torpedo.
The communications network of Starlink allows these tv guided torpedos to have infinite range, limited only by how much fuel can be loaded into the drone. If they were to use solar arrays to provide power for propulsion then even that restriction can be removed.
