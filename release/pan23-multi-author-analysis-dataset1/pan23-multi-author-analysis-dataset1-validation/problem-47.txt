He’s not talking about western country’s being paragons he’s talking about the people who live in the west who will protest their government’s if they are committing atrocities. The people of Russia are not the same their are outliers but the vast majority of Russians support this war and it’s not uncommon to hear them cheering the deaths of Ukrainians and you may say this is caused by their government crackdown on foreign and non state media at the start of the war but Russia has invaded other places like Georgia without good reason and they got very little resistance from their citizens. Even the US got a lot of pushback on the invasion of Iraq from it citizens and would have gotten more if it wasn’t for 9-11 and today it isn’t looked back as a just war even though the military was successful in it’s tasks.
4. Lastly, and this is the main point I was trying to make: while in Western societies the vast majority of people decry such acts, in Russia you still have the majority of people cheering along due to ideology.
It is entirely possible to condemn Russia without falling into relativism with America: after all, I am writing from Austria and the US is not "the West".
