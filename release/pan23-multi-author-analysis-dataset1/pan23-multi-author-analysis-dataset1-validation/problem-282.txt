Yeah I’m not sure what kind of a case we would have but I think the error was egregious enough that it is worth a consultation. Certainly not counting the money yet.
If you saw one member of a true group practice, I believe the group would have to dismiss or terminate you in accordance with state law from the practice before refusing to see you, so it would depend on the relationship between the providers, which would be based on the Tax ID each provider billed under. In scenario A, three providers all bill under the same tax ID, (a true group practice). You sue provider X. The group then dismisses you from the practice per state guidelines. Most states require a transition period, during which the provider and the other providers in the group have to be available for emergency care. After that, the group doesn’t have to see you.
Regarding malpractice you can consider consulting with a malpractice attorney. Keep in mind that a misdiagnosis does not imply negligence. Also be aware that malpractice litigation is expensive and you may have difficulties finding an attorney to take this on contingency if the damages are not large enough.
