NB: "native" people in a very general sense can mean any population native to a certain place in the world. For obvious reasons I can not speak to all those places, with colonisation having wildly different effects and outcomes in different parts of the world. My focus here was mainly on OPs examples, and esp. on indigenous people of the Americas. There, as I mention, colonial contact had specific effects including the esp. strong demographic catastrophe.
Ireland only merged with Great Britain in 1801, not in the 18th century. Would you be able to provide a source for Ireland being a minority language in the 18th century please? In school here were taught that it occurred after the famine.
The Japanese invested much time and money in efforts to eliminate aboriginal traditions deemed unsavory by Japanese culture, including tattooing, which was associated with the Yakuza criminal underworld in Japan. They confiscated aboriginal firearms with strict gun control laws. In the 1930s, a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs, rituals and a loyal Japanese identity. Chinese language newspapers were banned, Classical Chinese was banned in schools.
Notably there's overlap with the early English colonisation in North America: 1) in how generally native Americans were similarly marginalized, how conquest was justified and 2) more concretely - various important nobles would serve in both Ireland and then North America. Some of those were responsible for massacres against Irish people, and would bring their methods and views overseas.
