My wife and our six year old daughter were on their way down to the water when that guy came through, and they weren't wearing bright orange 'dont shoot me, hunters' vests because they don't have to, they live here. I stopped them on their way down to ask my wife for help in the garage, and I worry that if I hadn't, they would have been in this guy's path. You can say, 'oh I'm sure he wouldn't have shot them,' but it's clear that this person didn't know the pertinent laws surrounding the discharge of a firearm, so I wouldn't put it past them to fuck up so colossally as to take a human life in the course of their need to shoot a fucking bird. I am not in favor of giving bad hunters a pass just because there are good hunters out there. Good hunters can deal with the ramifications of the actions of bad hunters, the rest of us shouldn't have to deal with either.
Essentially it's a GIS (Geospatial Information System) problem/solution set. Everyone has smartphones with GPS these days. A simple hunter's GIS application based on standard maps, county records of buildings (counties already have this data in GIS databases), 150 yard boundaries, along with other posted PA hunting safety zone. This would easily take a few weeks to complete a first cut.
