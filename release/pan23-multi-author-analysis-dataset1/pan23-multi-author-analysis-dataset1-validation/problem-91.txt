No. Fusion power is not the Silver Bullet for Climate Change, at best it is the future-proofing solution for it, because reliable fusion power is still a couple decades away.
People who say that we should wait for fusion instead of investing in solar and wind are effectively giving the fossil fuel industry cover. Solar and wind power are robust and tested technologies that are ready to be deployed now, fusion is the technology that will take up the slack when we run out of square footage for solar and wind in the last half of the century.
That's a big ask. First you have to develop mining technology to operate in space at an industrial level (decades away). You also have to have reliable storage of said tritium in space after having been mined. Then you have to reliably transport that to earth which is almost prohibitively expensive (moon missions aren't cheap). Not to mention any technologies to utilize it.
