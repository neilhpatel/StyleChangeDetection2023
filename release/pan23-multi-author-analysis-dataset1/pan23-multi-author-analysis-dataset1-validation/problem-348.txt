Also, did you as the buyer or they as the seller pick this title company? Who picks and pays for title insurance in Florida is county specific. Also, some places like Sarasota, have laws that the final closing documents be ready 3 days before closing (for review by all parties). I doubt your title company was in compliance with local, state, and federal laws. If your real estate agent recommended this title company - do not recommend that agent to anyone! Title companies are notorious for offering kickbacks (some not directly monetary but services) to agents. Sound like the real estate broker for the seller probably ripped the title company a new one to fix the problem. Your agent's broker should have been at the title company the second things went sideways and they were not responding to phone calls or email - this is exactly the type of service your are paying for.
Thanks! Interestingly, the manager of the person at the title company who has been screwing all of this up sent a few emails this morning including a new cd with the correct amount and confirmation that I don’t owe anything more. She apologized for all of the issues. My lender and realtor confirmed this is final final and we can finally move in. I’m wondering if the seller lit up the title company… who knows. Anyway, appears all is resolved.
