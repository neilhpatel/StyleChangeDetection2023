Lack of/failure to communicate is a problem I'm sure you've experienced in your life. I'm also sure you've probably felt that an event you experienced didn't need to go the way it did, had the other party just been willing to talk or vice versa. So communication in general is a benefit in my eyes. Always more, never less.
South Korea's Samsung but also smaller companies like LG and Hyundai/Kia are incredibly important to world commerce, and about half of South Korea's population lives in and around Seoul, so it's a big deal economically and socially if the North attacks the south even leaving out Japan and US bases.
You keep straw manning me. How would not talking about NK nuclear threats be an abandoning of our allies?
I am still waiting for some kind of concrete example of how us talking about NK missile threats helps us, South Korea or Japan in any way.
edit: To clarify, I'm talking only about us, as in people in the west, discussing North Korean missile threats. That is the only thing I am discussing. I am not talking about removing sanctions, moving troops or any of that.
