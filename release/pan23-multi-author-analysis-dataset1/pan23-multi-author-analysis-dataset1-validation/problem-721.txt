In short, once a tooth is decayed enough the require a filling, there is a chance you will ultimately require a root canal. It feels like they cost you $2000, but the reality is that a root canal was always a possible outcome of tooth decay. This is true even if the teeth didn't hurt before the fillings. I wish dentists would be more upfront about this to help avoid the distress of feeling mistreated that you are currently experiencing. Fillings really can take a long time to "settle," as they like to say - months is not unreasonable. If they were deep, i.e. the decay penetrated far into the tooth and the required filling came close to the root, (you can ask your endodontist or new dentist this from looking at the before and after X-rays from your original filling), it was even more likely you would ultimately need a root canal.
Yes I think it would be the latter. Every time I asked if the persistent pain was normal, they just said “some people just take longer to heal—take more ibuprofen,” but by the time the endodontist saw me, he said my tooth was in awful shape and there was no question it needed the root canal. It seems crazy to me that the dentist could just say “it’s fine, it’s fine” repeatedly.
