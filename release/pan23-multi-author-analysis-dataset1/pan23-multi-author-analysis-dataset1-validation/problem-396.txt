Firstly, I'd find out how reasonable and friendly your neighbor is. Just go say hi, I just bought this land and wanted to meet my neighbors. Some folks will just move their stuff off your property. Others will get volatile fast.
NAL but the thing about towing, is without an agreement with a tow company like alot of private parking lots have that say "vehicles will be towed at owners expense" the vast majority of tow companies aren't gonna tow a car off your property without getting payment for it. Otherwise people would be doing it much more often. It's possible that with the proper paperwork showing your land, and proof that you have asked the owner to move the vehicles and given him a reasonable amount of time to do so, that the police who have agreements with tow companies could get the vehicle towed under their agreement, but it's also likely the police would tell you to have the vehicles towed yourself and sue the owner in small claims for the cost. 100% your best bet though is to talk to the owner of the vehicles. It's possible they're broken down and he's just waiting for a buddy with a tow truck to have some free time to move them, or a million other possibilities that aren't him just being a belligerent asshole. Making enemies with the neighbors you just bought property next to is likely gonna give you alot more headaches down the road than waiting a few weeks for the cars to be moved. It's likely this neighbor is friendly with all the other property owners in the area, and coming in and impounding his vehicles is gonna make you neighborhood enemy number one. And if he really is such a belligerent asshole that you can't even begin to reason with him, it's also a good idea to not piss him off. People like that are dangerous.
