I have receipts of my personal purchases for items that the individual erroneously claims I stole. The items in question are a specific item that are pertinent to the occupation mentioned, which I perform as a sole proprietor as well. The receipts are proof I purchased them. With this evidence in mind, and should the individual escalate this baseless claim, could the potential case be proven as extortion if they threaten to and/or file a police report?
1. Truth is always an absolute defense against defamation. 2. The complainant must prove actual damages arising directly and exclusively from the putative defamatory statement. 3. Complainant has to prove you made a false statement regarding a presently extant fact (not opinion) and that you knew the statement was false. 4. If complainant proves all of this, and several less daunting elements, he can only recover his actual damages (proving the dollar amount is challenging), punitive damages only if he proves you made the statement with the specific intent of harming him, and injunctive relief (in other words he is unlikely to recover much if he wins).
This really isn't your problem, is it? Make copies of the receipts you have for business purchase, and store them safely. Tell this person to cease all contact with you for any purposes whatsoever. Block and move on.
Yes, the individual contacted me personally. No letters, emails, or in-person dialogue with any lawyers, firms, or courts. I admit, I responded to this individual's very first email to inform them that the article in question did not reveal their name, business, or reasonable likeness and that my sentences within the article are truthful due to the messages received from this individual in the past that I have saved. Every subsequent message I have not replied to nor do I intend to.
