So, to say the least, African slaves and their descendants have played a major role in Indian history. There remains today a large Siddi/Habshi diaspora some quarter of a million strong, mostly scattered in ethnic enclaves in Gujarat, Karnataka, Hyderabad and along the western coast around Mumbai and Goa.
Yes. Slaves from East Africa and Madagascar were imported to India, both by European powers like Portugal and Netherlands, but also by Gujarati merchants, Omani, and Swahili traders.

_Sailors, Slaves and Immigrants; bondage in the Indian Ocean World 1750-1914_ by Allesandro Stanziani touches on enslaved Africans who were liberated by Anti-Slave patrols in the Indian ocean and brought to Bombay as personal servants.

They converted to Islam, like other Islamic slave soldiers, and their descendants today are primarily Muslims. They tended to come from southern Ethiopia rather than the Christian north, so most would have come from pagan backgrounds, and some might have already been Muslim. Others came from across East Africa, but the term 'habshi'/'Abyssinian' was often applied regardless of actual origin.
There was a major trade in Habshi (meaning Abyssinian) slaves from the Horn of Africa to the Islamic polities of India in the Late Medieval and Early Modern periods. Unlike in the Atlantic slave trade, however, these slaves were generally not bound for agricultural work but for domestic and military service, similar to mamlukes and janissaries elsewhere in the Islamic world. And just like those groups, these African slave-soldiers often ended up in positions of power, even coming to rule at times in places like Bengal and the Deccan. To give a sense of scale, there were reportedly some 40,000 African soldiers in Delhi already during the 14th century.
