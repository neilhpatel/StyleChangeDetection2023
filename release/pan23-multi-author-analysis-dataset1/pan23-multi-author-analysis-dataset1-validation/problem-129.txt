I feel sick because my cousin is basically forcing her son to join up in a few months when he turns 18…. And I love him but he’s not going to cut it in the military n he will not change for the better. He still such a kid it really kills me.
Edit: Apparently he was involved in the Revolutionary War as a teen, but I don't really think that's comparable to serving as a legislator or signing the Declaration of Independence.
Who cares any more? Good old Georgie S proving trumps theory that you never have to tell the truth about anything at all and you will be handsomely rewarded and eagerly given a position of power. This kid can say he is 36 and highly qualified with 50 years of experience on two planets and he will find votes. There are enough people now to vote R without a thought because derp that literally anyone at all can elected, even lying lifelong criminals.
