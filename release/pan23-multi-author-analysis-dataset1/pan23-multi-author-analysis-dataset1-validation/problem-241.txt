The first and most widely known court martial was that of Prem Sahgal, Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. The three accused men belonged to the three major religions of India: Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. Indians felt that the INA represented a secular national army when judged against the British-Indian Army, where caste and religious differences were preserved amongst ranks. In a matter of weeks, the INA officers were acclaimed heroes who fought for the freedom of India. The two major political parties in India, the Indian National Congress, which was majority Hindu but officially secular, and the Indian Muslim League found common cause in supporting the defendants.
Yep! Since the Persians had captured and razed the city, all that was left of Athens was its evacuated population and a fleet of 180 triremes. At the accusation that they were a people without a city, the Athenians understandably replied that they could take any city they wanted; they were a powerful roving navy with nothing to lose. They still had almost as many warships as the rest of the Greek alliance put together.
(Interestingly, Balmaceda Parkâ€™s northern terminus is next to Baquedano Plaza, named after Manuel Baquedano, the military general who succeeded Balmaceda as provisional president after Balmaceda sought refuge in the Argentine Embassy).
No. The Athenians were all fighting alongside him, in the naval battle of Artemision, which was the naval counterpart to the battle for the pass. The Athenians committed their full fleet of 200 triremes and about 40,000 men to this 3-day fight. This fleet did not withdraw until after Leonidas was killed and his army destroyed. Herodotos makes clear that they sailed back to Athens expecting to find the entire Peloponnesian army gathered and ready to continue the fight and avenge Leonidas, but they found no one. It was only then, after being completely let down by Sparta a second time, that they began evacuating their city.
