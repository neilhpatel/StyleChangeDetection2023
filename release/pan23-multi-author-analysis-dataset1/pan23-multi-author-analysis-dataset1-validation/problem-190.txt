Was younger Putin pretty badass? Yeah, he was. But in the here and now, he's taking cowardly actions. He will rarely stand up for what he started.
Actual nazis went to the US,where they were treated well and put in positions of great commodity,many Nazi and some ss officers made up the west German armed forces and in general the west viewed nazis in better terms than the East.So stop with the whole “south Americans are Nazi sympathizers” when it’s the western governments that genuinely embraced them.
He's rarely been appearing in public. He's debating running away. He's banning dissent. Speaking about the war that exists can get you killed. Even his own generals can't tell him the truth. Those are the actions of a cowardly man, a man who is afraid.
Propaganda! The leaders all rub shoulders in their little secret groups. The war itself is bullshyt. They need a way to keep the powerful on top and war is the best way for them to do so. Remember that the same banks are funding both sides of this war. They been doing this for so so so long and we as citizens still cannot see what’s in front of us.
