Boosters have been available for over a year now, kinda on people who haven't gotten their boosters at this point. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. There's no political will left to force/mandate vaccines, masks, or any other mitigation policies. Even China ended zero covid policies. It's about as over as it's going to be. Covid will be worse in winter when people retreat indoors and will have minor surges every year. But the worse case is honestly behind us.
>The move to end the national emergency and public health emergency declarations would formally restructure the federal coronavirus response to treat the virus as an endemic threat to public health that can be managed through agenciesâ€™ normal authorities.
That's fucked up. I work for a grocery chain and I have never had to pay for Flu shot or Covid. Sometimes hospitals will even give out shots for free or reduced cost.
