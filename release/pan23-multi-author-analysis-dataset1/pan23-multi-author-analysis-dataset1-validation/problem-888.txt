Classical Chinese refers to the written form of Chinese that was used in the classical literature (roughly 500 BCE to 200 AD) and from then on was used in official communication until the 20th century. Because it is a written style and Chinese is not alphabetic, the pronunciation of Classical Chinese is divergent over time and place. Although each dynasty published a phonology dictionary, the pronunciation of the same text would have been different by region, and there are some characters that had a vernacular pronunciation and a different “classical” pronunciation. Combined with a very different vocabulary set and some grammar differences, over time Classical Chinese became something that only the educated could really communicate with. This is called diglossia and is also true of Arabic for example.
In Mesoamerica, nahuatl which became a very influential language (to the point that modern day spanish in Mexico is very influenced by it) and some sources tell us that it was divided in the way that it was spoken between the common people macehualtlahtolli and the way people of high ranking would speak it pipiltlahtolli, furthermore the Mexica in particular were the ones who added the "tl" terminations that many of the nahuatl variants that are spoken to this day use, they considered that they had pushed the language to its most beautiful form and took great pride of their linguistic abilities.
What is the "turn of the Common Era"? Is that the secular equivalent to the Greogiran Callender's B.C.-A.D. flip, rougly correpsonding with birth of Christ?
Exactly. Other than the more straight-forward differences in vocab and grammar, Classical Chinese is absolutely full of idiomatic expressions, much more so than vernacular Chinese. Since people were educated in Classical Chinese through the Classics, poetry, literature, and so on, a big part of the "code" are either directly taken from those sources or are references to it. These idioms generally convey some message or moral beyond the words they contain. For a Western comparison, think of the phrase "to cross the Rubicon" and now imagine your letters are half made up of such phrases.
