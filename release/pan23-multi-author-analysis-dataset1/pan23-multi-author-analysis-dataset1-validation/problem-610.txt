The longer answer, as we should expect in these parts, is: it's complicated, and it depended a lot in the Soviet era on changing perceptions of nationality and official nationality policy.
It's important to note here that "nationality", as the USSR defined it and promoted it among its citizens, was itself a product of Soviet policy. Nationality was to be defined as a product of group consciousness (over territory, blood, or physiology), but the proper list of "approved" nationalities was determined by Soviet ethnographers for census use, with some input from the Party and Government - infamously the 1937 and 1939 censuses had to revise the list of nationalities one could choose in order to match an offhand comment Stalin had made about there being "about sixty nationalities in the USSR". If a person wasn't sure what nationality they were, then census takers could prompt them based on kinship, religion, region, or even language. The idea behind all of this was that non-Russian peoples would undergo a process of "double assimilation" - first into a national consciousness (and this often came with territorial implications, as most approved nationalities were supposed to have an SSR, ASSR, or autonomous region of which they were the "titular" nationality) and then into a wider, Russian-language Soviet identity.
Thanks! That was incredibly interesting and engaging to read, the correlation between the UK and the Sovietâ€™s was super helpful in understanding the system. I definitely learned more than what I was asking for, and my family is of Belarusian decent so the extra information separating the two was particularly interesting. This was my first post on this subreddit and I love history so I was honestly surprised at how great that answer was.
