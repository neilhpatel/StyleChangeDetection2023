It is not a "claim against their title." The original owner is suing for damages not to void the deed or anything that would impair OPs title to the property.
If any plaintiff gets a judgment and puts a lien against property it could impair the title (and might cause a problem with the mortgage) but that's not what title insurance covers.
If the seller were someone claiming that they already had a valid lien against the property created before the house was transferred to OP and title was transferred to OP as clear of any liens, then that would be something the title insurance might defend or pay a claim on if it were a valid lien.
This is just plain wrong. Title insurance covers existing title defects at closing, not potential future lawsuits that have nothing to do with titles. If you believe otherwise, please read your title insurance policy, you'll find a clause stating the policy doesn't apply to liens applied after the title research was completed.
IANAL. This is a small claims court case, you need to go online to the Michigan courts system and look at what it says. You likely have to file a written response to the claim, which will be, "the seller agreed in writing to reduce the price from $375,000 to $360,000. A copy of the contract and addendum are attached." When you go to court, you show the judge the contract, the addendum and any other paperwork from your real estate transaction. The judge will rule in your favor because you can't just change your mind after a contract is signed and executed, that's not how contract law and real estate law works.
