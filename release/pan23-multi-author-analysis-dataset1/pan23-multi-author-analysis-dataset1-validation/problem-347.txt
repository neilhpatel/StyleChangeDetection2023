IANAL but an HR professional who managed live events and often had to send crew out onsite for days and weeks. They always had free days (usually the actual event days) where set up and strike crews were just kept in the hotel until the event was over and free to do whatever. We paid hourly and we did pay per diem for meals onsite on all days, but they also took crew vehicles and could not leave even with a weekend off. They were free to drink and basically do whatever they wanted in this time on location, and I think that separated it from being on call. We did not have to pay for these rest days. We did let anyone who wanted to drive their own vehicle IF they weren’t booked as a truck driver, but didn’t cover their mileage or any extra travel time they spent over what the crew traveling together accrued. Most events were in Colorado though.
Do be aware, being litigious is not a protected right and unless a case is opened and a verdict rendered, you can declare an intent to file a case, then it may be closed with no wrongdoing found, and then you might be fired at will without any opportunity for recourse. Do yourself a favor and do not mention your intent to the employer as it can be used against you.
Both actually. We're still trying to convince them so there may not be an issue but that what happened last weekend and they're trying the same this weekend.
