To be more specific (and to reinforce /u/Iphikrates), a Greek in the 1st century A.D. would have read tekton to mean something like an average, ordinary woodworker who did various jobs as a less than skilled but not totally unskilled worker. The rural context of Nazareth would not have been surprising or unusual. Someone who knew both Greek and Hebrew would have understood some ambiguity in the term but would have realized the story was implying that Jesus was from a humble (if not totally disadvantageous) background.
But all this is kind of irrelevant because, although the Bible was written in Greek, the description comes from a narrative. Some people call Jesus a tekton. And they would not have been speaking Greek. They would have been speaking Aramaic or Hebrew. Due to translation conventions, this means they were probably calling Jesus a חרש or a נגר. In particular, woodworkers in Ancient Hebrew would have actually been called חָרַשׁ עֵצִים, meaning "wood plougher".
Fantastic answer. Does someone familiar with Greek know if there is a specialized word (instead of tekton) meaning only carpenter or woodworker? I believe there is one for mason or stoneworker (litho\-something).
