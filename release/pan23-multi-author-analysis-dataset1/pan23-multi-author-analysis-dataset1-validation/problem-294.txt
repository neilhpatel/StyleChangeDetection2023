I agree with you 100%. I am not in the mother's home to know what goes on there when the daughter is there. I can only attest for what I have seen first hand at his home while I'm with him. He is not drinking when I am there with his daughter or my child. I only know this because I randomly sneak kisses to check his breath. I have been walking a fine line in trying to figure out how to address this with him. And when I finally found the right way to do so, we had a very healthy conversation about it. I can attest that when I am there, there is no danger to his child or mine. He is a wonderful father and his daughter means everything to him. He's just looking to get help and this is why he wants to get help. He wants to be around a lot longer for his daughter and be a healthy example. We have started doing meditation together and yoga to help calm his anxiety and stress. (I think these are added to other reasons he's drinking).
Outpatient? So there’s potentially no disruption to his custody time while participating? She doesn’t need to know and likely has no rights to know. I know my ex is in psychological care and on a cocktail of mood stabilizers. It was irrelevant to custody. How the children are treated in his custody is relevant.
