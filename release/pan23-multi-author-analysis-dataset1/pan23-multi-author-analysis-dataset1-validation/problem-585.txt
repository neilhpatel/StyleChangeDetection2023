If Russia did annex Belarus and tried to turn the Belarusian army on Ukraine, expect rebellion/civil war.
Economically, yes. Belarus and Russia have somewhat consistently relied on each other both politically and economically. Belarus’ wealth comes largely from refining oil and sending it into the EU. Sanctions bit and now both countries see an opportunity to merge economies, supposedly whilst holding onto Belarusian sovereignty. The future will tell, but it’s likely that most big businesses in Belarus will be ‘absorbed’ rather than a loss of territory or movement into the Russian Federation. A single currency might even begin, which would be wildly unpopular as most Belarusians save in dollars and consider the ruble on either side as unstable.
That being said. Yeah I'm 100% sure down the line belaruss is intended to be on the Neo soviet/russian empire.
Imperialist projects are generally popular assuming they are successful. I don't know where this notion that Russians are in principle opposed to this war comes from. If anything they are pissed off how incompetently it was done.
