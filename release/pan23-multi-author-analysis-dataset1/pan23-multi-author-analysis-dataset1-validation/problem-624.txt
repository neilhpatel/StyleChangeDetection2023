The US did not join the First World War when it began in 1914 and most of the German colonial possessions in the Pacific were carved up and captured during the first year of conflict. By the time the US joined the war in 1917 the question of the Pacific had long since been decided. Australian troops had completed the annexation of German territories in Papua New Guinea and neighboring islands, New Zealand had taken control of Samoa, and Japan had seized the German-claimed islands of the Marianas, Carolines, Marshalls, etc (most of the region of Micronesia). At the end of the war, the League of Nations recognized these claims as Mandates-- so they were not territory that the colonial powers could annex, they were territories that they should "tutor" until such time as they could become independent-- though what they means exactly was left pretty nebulous and effectively the islands will be treated as colonial territories, and in the case of Japan Nan-yo, or the South Seas, settler territories.
I mean for embassies. Like there are 197 or 193 total nation's in the world. How would a tiny island manage to have diplomatic relations with all of them? Do they just have a few diplomats and those operate in a large amount of countries?
