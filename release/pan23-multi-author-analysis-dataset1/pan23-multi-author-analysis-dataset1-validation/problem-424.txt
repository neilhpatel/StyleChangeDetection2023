I can only answer this question regarding to Antiquity, since this is the subject I studied during college. This answer will also primarily be focused on the philosophical interpretation of suicide, not how the state or the common people interpreted suicide. It is especially difficult to know what the common people’s attitude towards suicide was, simply because there are barely any sources that tell us about that. I will start by explaining how suicide was seen by different philosophies, starting with Platonism and ending with Christianity. I will also shortly give some info on how suicide was seen in other genres than philosophical texts, before providing a conclusion that hopefully answers your question.
As you can see, suicide was always present in the elite Ancient society; be it in prose, poetry and philosophy. It was mostly condemned, but some saw it as an honourable way to die; this is supported by the fact that some death penalties were committing suicide (like in Socrates’ and Seneca’s case), which meant you kept honour in dying. However, with the rise of Christianity and especially after Augustine, suicide becomes unacceptable and the idea of an honourable death through suicide fades away.
It is also very difficult to research the opinion towards suicide from the Early Christians because there are so few sources that mention suicide. The Bible does not explicitly permit or prohibit suicide, so we cannot use that as a source. We can assume that the Christians copied many of the opinions of the Jewish faith, but they also barely mention suicide. Flavius Iosephus takes a very negative stance towards suicide, explicitly saying that God gave us the gift of life and that only He can take it away, which corresponds with the Platonic beliefs. There are some Christian philosophers that mention suicide: Clemens of Alexandria (150-215 AD), Tertullianus (155-220 AD), Origenes (185-253 AD) and Lactantius (250-325 AD). Clemens was one of the first Christians who wrote about suicide and his beliefs were more of a mixture of Stoicism, Platonism and Christianity, which influenced his opinion on suicide. He believes that those that do not want to die for their faith, because they think suicide is bad, are cowards and not true Christians. But he also does not want Christian to actively seek martyrdom: when they did that, they did this out of hate for their maker. He thus believes that when the authorities find you and execute you, you have to die for your faith and essentialy commit suicide, but actively seeking it is forbidden.
Fantastic answer! So glad to have found one of the dozens of people in the world who take an interest in historical suicide.
