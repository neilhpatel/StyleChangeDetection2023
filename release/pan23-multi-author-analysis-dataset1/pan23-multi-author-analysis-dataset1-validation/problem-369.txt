Characteristics of cities have absolutely been implicated in the high mortality rates of the ancient circum-Mediterranean world as well as medieval. This is true of the basics (disease, famine, violence) and of factors embedded in contemporary culture. Alex Scobie, for example, stresses everything from the medical advice for sick people to seek healing at public baths (take a bunch of people with different diseases or with vulnerable health conditions and put them in the same place; what could go wrong) to the frequent collapse of overcrowded tenement housing.
I neeeeed this book in my life, thank you for advertising for yourself. Now I just have to wait 4-7 business days after August 17th. Congrats on getting one of the big houses!
I am not aware of evidence specifically relating to sewers (although the Cloaca Maxima was a state project) but other public goods like streets and aqueducts have been found with donation notices from elites, motivated by what has been called "competitive eurgetism" in which the social status competition of elites took the form of lavish donations to the city (this was also a system the Romans deliberately cultivated, eg Egypt did not have systems of competitive eurgetism before the Roman conquest). On he other hand, there are some pretty compelling arguments that this is overrepresented and the tab was mostly picked up by civic coffers from fees, tolls, taxes, etc.
Honestly? It doesn't make a huge difference one way or another for me financially, since I'm working with a major press. It's always good to boost Amazon rankings; it's also great to support indie bookstores either locally or online!
