Two things. First, it seems this rural county is refusing to certify their votes because of a problem in another county. Is that right? That seems pretty much outside their scope of duties, doesn’t it?

Election denial is now in the medical books as a new disease known as electile dysfunction with symptoms that include loss of reason, lose of rational thinking, loss of integrity and believing in hallucinations of 2000 mules voting. There is no cure other than to turn off right wing media propaganda machine outlets. That’s the only way to reverse this affliction.
