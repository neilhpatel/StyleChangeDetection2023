In the program I was in, there was a strict policy that only 1 day could be missed and made up per clinical rotation. Two strikes and you were out, even if you missed for a good reason.
A lot of it is very complicated and unique to the study and practice of medicine, there are a lot of nursing school requirements, clinicals requirements, supervising and grading requirements, etc that come from the state, as well as agreements between hospitals/nursing homes and the schools that include tricky things like insurance coverage of nursing students. No matter how much it “appears” that someone could “just” do X, Y, Z and be fine, there’s often a problem with one or more of those various factors I mentioned stopping it. For instance, the school might only have insurance covering you guys for X days or on X dates and only at Y property. A makeup day, or more than one makeup day, may just not be feasible as it would require renegotiation of terms with the healthcare provider and the insurance provider. Or the state’s requirements may just be no more than Z absences, period, no exceptions mentioned in the state regulations.
