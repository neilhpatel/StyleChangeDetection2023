Also may I ask what would have been a better way to warn them than what I already did? I wrote it down in my onboarding papers, told my nurses, and my dentist when he came in. I've NEVER had a violent outburst from anesthesia so I didn't know this would happen. I did tell them exclusively how to wake me and to not shake me awake which they admitted they didn't listen. So what else could I have done better?
NAL and I donâ€™t have much help for you besides the already suggested unfortunately but the word for a negative reaction to anesthesia like you had is a combative reaction â€˜emergence agitationâ€™ and it is definitely a thing and for future anesthesia they can wean you off it slowly so you donâ€™t â€˜wake upâ€™ in fight mode.
Thanks! Yeah I'm sure it was a first (hopefully) and I know looking to get anybody fired or anything I just wanna get to the bottom of it and make sure I'm not liable for what happened. I did tell them in person and in my paperwork that I was extremely hard to wake off anesthesia and to be careful but who knows ðŸ¤· for all I know I could have woke up mid surgery and they were just trying to keep me back in the chair.
