The truth / historical fact is that by the time Europeans reached North America, plant domestication / agriculture had a history several thousand years deep, and the majority of the population from the Atlantic coast to west of the Mississippi River was living in permanent villages, towns, and urban centers supported primarily by food production.
When Europeans arrived in North America, they encountered Mississippian peoples living in permanent and well-organized towns and villages across the landscape, which was extensively populated and managed. These cultures were predominately agricultural, supported (by that time) by mainly maize agriculture, although some of the earlier indigenous North American domesticates were likely also grown at that point.
Southwestern Native American cultures were growing corn 4000 years ago, and by approximately 2300 years ago (plus or minus a couple centuries), corn appears to have been incorporated into the crop complex grown in the Eastern Woodlands. However-- and this is important-- these were not the first crops to be grown in Eastern / Southeastern North America. Instead, corn and beans were folded into an existing set of indigenous agricultural practices that had been developing in North America since at least 5,000 years ago, and arose out of earlier practices dating at least another two or three thousand years earlier.
Could you expand on this at all? It seems like a no-brainer for us as modern people to consider a crop's calorie density when deciding what to plant, but they would have had no conception of that, right? Was there ever an understanding that corn agriculture was the optimal choice for efficient land use, or was it more of an emergent effect that culture or towns that focused on corn were able to support more people?
