I agree that you might not need an attorney if there’s nothing illegal on the phone/no evidence of illegal activity. A printout from a “phone dump” will likely include location information, texts (including some that have been deleted), search history, photos and videos, and a whole lot of noise.
No. But apparently in your case there is something that would not only prompt the police to seek a warrant but likely enough to issue one.
If there is incriminating evidence on your phone (or you even think there might be) find yourself an attorney now to try and squash the warrant. If there isn't anything on your phone you can just allow the police to view it if you chose to and get your phone back.
Criminal defense attorney. It is very normal to search the robbery victim’s phone and it is legal for them to keep the phone until they get a warrant. They might be looking for evidence of how the robbery was set up (were you meeting someone on Craigslist), they might be looking for a motive (was this a drug deal turned robbery), and they might just be looking to corroborate your story in some way.
