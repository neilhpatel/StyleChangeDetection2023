The same story is told by Herodotus about the Egyptian pharaoh Psamtik I, and it's just as believable in Herodotus as it is in Salimbene. So, in brief, Frederick didn't really do this; he had extremely harsh critics for all the real things that he did, and if he did stuff like this on top of everything else, we definitely would have heard about if from other, more neutral sources.
But we should remember that Salimbene was extremely hostile to Frederick, and although his chronicle is full of interesting events, he was hardly an historian and pretty much everything he writes should be taken with a giant handful of salt. Frederick's modern biographer David Abulafia calls Salimbene a “shameless gossip” (Abulafia, pg. 251) and “foul-tongued” and says that he spread “preposterous stories...It is highly unlikely that Frederick indulged his scientific interests this way.” (Abulafia pg. 260).
Given that there at least two instances of this story being told, has a real "experiment" like this ever been conducted, or even seriously considered by anyone?
