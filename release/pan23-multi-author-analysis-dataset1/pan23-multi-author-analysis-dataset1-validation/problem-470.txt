Thus, while Lee did make a few efforts to rehabilitate his image (and not just out of pride, but out of a real possibility that he would be prosecuted in federal court), it was mostly others who did the heavy lifting. In the opening chapter of historian Alan T. Nolan's 1991 book Lee Considered: General Robert E. Lee and Civil War History, the author explored the "Mythic Lee" and briefly describes how his rehabilitated image came to be. It was mostly done by Lost Causers in the aftermath of the war, looking for a hero that could deflect away from the treason and slavery discussions then dominating the political discourse. The success was not instant, but the myth gained traction over the following decades. Writes Nolan:
The oath of commission he took can be argued to have provided authority for his departure from the US Army (and of course the oath was changed in 1862 to remove this... flexibility of interpretation of loyalties), but the argument starts to falter a bit if Virginia remained with the Union. Firstly, as a procedural matter, as a US Army regular, I believe he would have been kept under the Union Regulars, not drawn back to the colors of the Commonwealth. Secondly, with VA remaining in the union, there is much less flexibility open to him if he is to remain true to his word.
