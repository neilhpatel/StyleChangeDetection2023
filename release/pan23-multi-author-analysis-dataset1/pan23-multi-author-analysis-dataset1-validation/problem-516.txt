Trebuchets were useful for a large range of tasks, from breaking walls to launching flammable materials, to launching large numbers of smaller projectiles. These were more versitile weapons that had a number of drawbacks. Firstly, they required more experience than the aforementioned Ballista type catapults (exceptions to this do exist, but generally speaking this is true.) They were much larger, therefore more expensive to make, as well as harder to move, so they were used often by defenders in situations where an attack with siege engines was expected. A good example of the cost of these weapons is the Siege of Castle Stirling, where a large trebuchet, called War Wolf, was fired after the castle's surrender was offered, purely because King Edward I didn't want to waste the opportunity.

With this in mind, catapults were used regularly in medieval warfare and earlier, though certain catapults were more common in different points in history due to their individual capabilities.
