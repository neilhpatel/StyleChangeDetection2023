Your post just says you got to Poland and had to take a test and then you were forced to return to the UK. I'm not sure how you expected anyone to understand what happened.
Poland was the problem, because I’ve bought a connection flight, I wasn’t Able to proceed with the flight because Poland didn’t allow since only residents of Russia can travel my problem is that the airline sold be the ticket, refused the refund and made me go thought it knowing that I wouldn’t be able to proceed and reach my destination.
I had all the documents I’ve needed, the reason I’ve got denied is that Poland is red flagged because of COVID and my tourist visa didn’t allow me to travel to Russia, because only family and residents of Russia are allowed to travel via connecting flights through Poland.
Im not best at describing what happened, so I apologise about that, but basically what happened is that due Covid policies I was denied access to Russia Though Poland even tho my ticket was fine, just because I didn’t have family in Russia.
Yes. It isn't their responsibility to make sure your visa is valid. That's your problem. They don't know if you have family in Russia or what Russian customs will do, they just fly the plane.
