When you buy using a brokerage, you don’t get what you pay for. This was ftx in a nutshell, this method is currently used today in our regular stock market exchange. Ftx was a pawn by wallstreet and it blew up in their faces, but as this unfolds you have talk of regulation - which means they are fighting to not be obsolete as the crypto -sphere is evolving.
Big take away is crypto is indeed a threat to fiat, and this ftx scandal is the trojan horse to push regulation talk.
Crypto is a direct threat to their multi billion dollar lifestyle. Ftx wasn’t even decentralized. The regulators of wallstreet were COMPLICIT via contracts recognizing ftx securities as collateral.
Right? Unless you’re buying from a “specialized vendor” on the Dark web, there’s really no point. Sure, some folks got lucky and became millionaires but thousands more just took out a 2nd mortgage and fucked themselves over. 😆.
