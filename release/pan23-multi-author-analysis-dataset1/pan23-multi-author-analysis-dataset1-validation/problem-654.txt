Almost a third of the total sales from the Top 100 companies are by the five largest companies on the list, all of which are from the U.S.: Lockheed MartinLMT, Raytheon TechnologiesRTX, BoeingBA, Northrop GrummanNOC and General DynamicsGD; between them they had $192 billion in sales.
Great. Spend $600 billion on destruction. Why not spend this money to build a settlement on mars or anything that is pro life? We kind of beg to be wiped of this planet.
Imagine if all that money was put towards "good" causes, like environmental sustainability, education, poverty eradication, space exploration.
I thought it was fairly clear, perhaps I misread the tone of the comment above. I got the impression it was sarcastic, as in 'are you a weird conspiracy nut who thinks Putin is being mind controlled by satellite rays?'.
The next five on the list include one UK company, BAE Systems, and four Chinese firms – Norinco, AVIC, CASC and CETC – between them these five reported arms sales of almost $102 billion, according to SIPRI.
