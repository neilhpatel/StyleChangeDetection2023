The answer to your question really depends on what era of the Roman Republic/Empire you are talking about. The crisis of the 3rd century in the Roman Empire led to tighter imperial restrictions on jobs deemed important by the state and the urban centers of the Empire. Many collegia "guilds" (but a better analogy would be trade association or union) were, therefore, controlled by imperial administrators to ensure that they provided the necessary provisions for the Empire.

Indeed. The view of collegia expressed above is extremely outdated and solely restricted to professional collegia, who increasingly we are finding are not nearly as normative as we thought. In addition to what you've listed I would add Bendlin's groundbreaking article "Associations, funerals, sociality, and Roman law: the collegium of Diana and Antinous in Lanuvium (CIL 14.2112) reconsidered," which has really put into focus how little we know about non-professional collegia and done much to refocus the thinking on regulation of collegia as a form of social control rather than economic control.

Some of these late Roman coloni undoubtedly evolved into medieval serfs -- and indeed they were still being called coloni centuries later. See for example the capitulary given at Diedenhofen in the early 9th century, which seems to use serfs and coloni more or less interchangeably:
