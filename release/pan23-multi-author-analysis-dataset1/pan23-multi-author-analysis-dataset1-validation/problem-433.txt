You've already answered the question. Muskets were cheap to make, and got cheaper. They required little training to operate, particularly as the military drill became widespread. Those are huge advantages.
Interestingly, the above development occured quasi independently in another part of the world, the middle east and India, The Ottoman empire developed a masterful synthesis of the many military influences they came across, their horse cavalry tradition of the steppes, the musket infantry that was slowly gaininng prominence, and the hussite wagon fort tactics they fought against in the balkans. The Ottomans would place their wagons in formation with cannons and infantry behind, and the cavalry at the wings, the cavalry would then charge and try to lure the enemy by feigning retreat, only to pin them down with massed fire, and then in turn they would charge and crush the shattered army. It worked to great success against the safavids at Chaldiran (1514) and the hungarians at Mohacs (1526). This tactics would later be used by the central asian conqueror Babur in the battles of Panipat and Khanua, which would cement his power over the region and establish the Mughal dynasty in India (The safavids would also acquire firearms but their use is less well documented). Again this is in general terms the application of a defensive strategy using firearms, just better fit for the conditions of central asian warfare, dominated by open terrain and agile horse cavalry. Indeed battles would become rare in this region too, the might of firearms uncontested. The horse archer tradition would very much remain alive in this part of the world though, their tactical effectiveness was unmistakeable, once again, they perfectly existed side by side with musket infantry, better suited for the heavily fortified balkan front for example.
You have two separate ‘worlds’ you’re combing. The Asian world (including the Middle East) and the western world (Europe).
The thing that confuses people when it comes to the musket is ultimately the untapped potential that we nowadays know it has, it was a rather innefficient application of a method for generating kinetic energy which is, in principle, far more effective than that of a bow, releasing tension created by pullin a string, which is tied to and ultimately limited by human strenh, compared to the chemical energy released through a combustion reaction, which is not limited by human strenh but by other technical concerns, It is thus quite literally replacing manual labor with a machine you just need to learn to operate, or as said more colloquially, "it requires less training", although i think that's slightly misleading, because musketeers could be and often were professional and highly trained soldiers who understood the intricacies of using and maintaining their weapons, and on the flipside bowmen could be and often were poor soldiers who could not afford better equipment. But in the end whatever you can achieve with a bow that you can also achieve with a musket takes lots of training with the former. One discussion is whether or not the english longbowmen could penetrate the heavy armor of the day, another one is whether you'd prefer to train to be able to do that or just use a musket.
