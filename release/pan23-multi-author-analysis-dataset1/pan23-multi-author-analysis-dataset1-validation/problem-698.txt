I was thinking in particular of a paper I recently read (whose author I forget) looking at how the wuxing/five phases cycle was applied to the ideology of early dynasties, and how each dynasty used a successive color/virtue in its iconography. Apparently that practice broke down in the Yuan dynasty, as choosing a color would have implied legitimizing one of several alternate imperial lines that did or didn’t include previous Inner Asian dynasties in the succession.
A good question! I think it's important to perhaps conceptualise 'New Qing' as a particularly prominent outgrowth of a broader interest in Inner Asian relationships to Chinese history, rather than a singular movement from which other ideas have diverged. So for instance you have Nicola di Cosmo, as a broad scholar of Sino-Inner Asian dynamics, working simultaneously on Han-Xiongnu relations and also at Qing state formation in the early 2000s. On some level the de-nationalising of Chinese history was already going to be somewhat set in motion by Cohen, as well as a broad trend in modern historiography that rejects the self-narration of the nation-state.
I think it's important to state that the 'New Qing' doesn't do anything as such – it's a broad-brush label to describe Qing historiography in the wake of Cohen's 'China-centric' paradigm and the growth in emphasis on Inner Asia in the 1980s. As noted in the post, historians disagree significantly even on the ideological basis of the Qing state. With Cixi, therefore, you find some radically different positions: Edward J. M. Rhoads, for example, finds her a largely effective and proactive defender of Manchu status and privilege in Manchus and Han, whereas Pamela Crossley sees her as largely a figurehead in The Wobbling Pivot. I wrote a brief biographical summary of Cixi with some references if you'd like more.
