This is non-news, and certainly nothing that will ‘bring down’ anyone like him or the other lying conservatives. They couldn’t care less.
A big problem that is starting to surface though is the publicity and scandals around Santos have enticed a frenzy of bottom feeding GOP backroom operatives who understand the influence they can exert via a hapless moron like Santos and the access they can cultivate from being in the inner circle of a clueless, amoral congressman.
Case in point: Madison Cawthorn. He's literally the only person the GOP has pushed out, and it's only because he said shit that was supposed to be kept on the DL that made his colleagues look bad. That's the only no-no.
Burra, in partnership with Gavin Wax, got his start in politics with a takeover of the New York Young Republican Club, turning it into a proto-fascist network with links to a roll call of US and foreign far-right groups. The aims of Burra's inner circle were well stated by Wax at an NYYRC event when he said "We want total war. We must be prepared to do battle in every arena. In the media. In the courtroom. At the ballot box. And in the streets.".
