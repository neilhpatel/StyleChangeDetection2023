I reside in the Phoenix area. I saw someone say you can’t keep her if the owner asks for her back. I would fight for her. Depending where you are, if you live in this area I would try Arizona Humane Society since they also investigate animal cruelty cases. Supply them with the video evidence. Hopefully they can assist in case it comes down to a fight. I would try and stay away from Maricopa County Animal Control. Good luck.
Thank you sooo much for getting back to me, I haven’t had her come back yet and I took the dog to the vet they told me she has no chip and is going to need a deep dental cleaning and they noted the limp she has from a little over a week ago, I have to wait for blood results for her (dog had a few black nipples, vet said it could be cancerous but highly unlikely). I really want to follow your advice but it makes me so upset that she may have a chance at getting the dog back if the bitch decides to look for the dog but it’s probably better if I just do as you said. Crimestop told me I could.
