My personal favorite is the magical caravan of migrants that shows up every other September and then vanishes without a trace after the election.
So in advance I'd like to say that I am excited for the next magical caravan of migrants coming to kill us all and take our jobs that will appear around September of 2024 and disappear magically at midnight on election day.
lol there are no more good places to shop. Walmartâ€¦ I donâ€™t even want to get into. Kroger ðŸ‘Œ much better than Walmart with employee pay etc (so not good) Some targets have grocery stores and some donâ€™t. But a target in Minnesota collecting facial recognition for a police department doesnâ€™t give me any confidence in the corporation.
I love how they tossed in that burn. But in all seriousness, wtf is with these almost end-of-life rich people hellbent on destroying the country? Can't they just enjoy the rest of their short lives?
