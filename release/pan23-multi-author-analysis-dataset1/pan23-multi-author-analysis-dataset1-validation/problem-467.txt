Or the profiteering off the death of Ukrainians. The sanctions are meant to slow or stop Russia monetarily In the war. I guess indian does not give a shit.
Absolutely. Iran is a massive sponsor of terrorism but India wants cheaper energy. The West has been propping up authoritarian or terrorist regimes for decades so it’s nothing new. The world is an ugly and complex place unfortunately.
Russia isn't under embargo. Sanctions aren't meant to prevent Russia from getting stuff or selling stuff, they are meant to cripple the Russian economy, not kill it outright. There probably is an argument to a full embargo, but it's probably more important to not alienate India, China, and other non-western countries. They aren't really helping Russia in any meaningful way. We don't want to change that.

Totally disagree. The truth is that the West was completely okay with India and China profiting off of these oil sanctions as long as Russian revenue took a hit.
