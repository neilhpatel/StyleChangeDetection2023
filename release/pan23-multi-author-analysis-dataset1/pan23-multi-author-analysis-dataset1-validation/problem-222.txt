While I’m sorry to hear about your difficulties in life, it’s really not relevant to a potential malpractice case. Your free to consult with a malpractice attorney if you wish, but this doesn’t sound like a strong case at all. Malpractice lawsuits are very complex, lenhy, and expensive. For some context, most viable malpractice lawsuits involve significant quantifiable damages like long term disability or death.
Okay. Thanks for the advice. I will still be seeking out a lawyer. I don’t care if the settlement is under $10,000, I just want someone to be held accountable for the fact that I wasn’t treated properly. And in my mind, spreading the virus to other parts of my body IS a long term quantifiable illness. And if I’m already disabled aka susceptible to illnesses, I know that I’m considered more fragile than other people filing for claims. And I know that latter part specifically bc it was how I won a car accident claim— I was already disabled so therefore my damages had more of an impact on my life compared to someone else.
