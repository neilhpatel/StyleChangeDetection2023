This is about Judge Qannons lack of authority at all in the case, which would make her special master order moot. The order takes place in 7 days, unless Trump files an appeal with the Supreme Court and they issue a stay. Special council Jack Smith is overseeing this Mar a Lago documents case AND the separate Jan 6/election investigation.

It certainly does involve that investigation, inasmuch as Cannon's order purported to prohibit the DOJ investigation (which is now the special counsel investigation) from using the evidence obtained at Mar a Lago until the special master review was complete. The 11th Circuit had already temporarily stayed most of Cannon's order, so it didn't have much impact on the investigation, but today's ruling eliminates her order entirely.
I think good news. The whole special master thing was wrong and then Cannon added other limitations on the special master which got beat down.
