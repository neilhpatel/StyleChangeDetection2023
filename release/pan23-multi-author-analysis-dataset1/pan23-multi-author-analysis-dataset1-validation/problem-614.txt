Wills and Trusts almost always have survivorship terms - something like "a beneficiary/legatee must survive me by at least 30 days or they will be deemed to have predeceased me." But I've not seen one for a beneficiary designation on an asset like life insurance or retirement accounts; only things like simultaneous death determinations for when it can't be determined which party died first - like if they are both killed in an accident.
Ok. So, I get your issue, I think. There were no named contingent beneficiaries, which was poor foresight on your parents, unfortunately. No disrespect meant by the former statement. You want to become the administrator of the estate because without a contingent beneficiary, it goes to the estate. But they have debts that I am guessing are greater than the estate plus life insurance? Or maybe not?
Usually, if there is no beneficiary named or the named beneficiary has pre-deceased the insured, the insurance contract has a default beneficiary - usually close family members (spouse, then kids). Have you spoken to the life insurance company? They should pay out without probate but theyâ€™ll ask for death certificates and you have to fill out some forms.
