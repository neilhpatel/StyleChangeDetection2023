I would not. Because it just doesn't match reality. This "40% of polls outside the error margins" does not apply to reputable polling houses. It just doesn't.

I think given the history of how 2016 turned out with polls showing Hillary winning a massive, easy election but the reality led to everyone finding out how irrelevant polling was because people lied or the polsters didn't/couldn't pick the right sample size, it wasn't wrong for people to assume that this time around the media may be actively biased toward the Dems to keep sanity as opposed to favoring their ratings.
They do, though. They don't really try to predict, and reputable polling houses are very upfront about this. They present a snapshot of how people feel at the time of the poll, and that is within an error margin itself.
