> Between 1991 and 2020, Ukraine concluded arms contracts worth nearly $1.6 billion with Pakistan. Islamabad has reportedly clinched a deal with Kyiv for the repair of its T-80UD fleet at a cost of $85.6 million.
Upgradation: upgrading something. Used all the time in official documents in Pakistan. For eg. there's a project called "Upgradation of the Islamabad Expressway" close to where I live.
Absolutely wrong. The perfect example of NAM can be seen in the relationships with Ukraine and Russia. Unlike western countries, India hasn’t sided with one side. India helped both the countries. By sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine. (Which Zelensky thanked India recently for). And by abstaining from voting in UNSC resolutions against any country. India has also come forward for being a negotiator between both of them. That’s a very false statement you made when you said that India sided with USA against China. No, it hasn’t and who said you that? India just have better relations with USA than with China. That’s all.
Real rivalries are between China-India, India-Pakistan, Russia-USA, China-USA. Other relations are based on interests.
