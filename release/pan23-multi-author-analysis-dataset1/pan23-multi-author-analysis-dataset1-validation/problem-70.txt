The first world war and its aftermath killed a lot of men, both from the land owning classes and their workers. Contrary to the impression of cowardly officers relaxed about the death of the proletariat, a trope with a longer history than Blackadder, it was front-line officers who died in greater proportion. 12% of private soldiers were killed in the first world war, but 17% of officers and 20% of old Etonians who served. Commissioned officers were often from land-owning families, which were weakened by their loss. And of course although no-one would paint the post-war economy as a workers' paradise -- the General Strike gives the lie to that -- wages had risen substantially \[1\] which made it harder for the great houses to keep their workforces.
Interesting. I had not been aware of wage increases and the changes in tax during that time. I am surprised to hear that some of the houses survived until the 1980s. Do you know if these houses were run as a skeleton crew at that point or what state were they in?
Inheritance tax was increased substantially by the Finance Acts of 1894 and, particularly, 1909-10 (which sparked a constitutional crisis when the Lords refused to pass it) and the latter legislation also introduced capital gains tax (in effect) on land sales. Together, that meant that property needed to generate enough of an income to pay the taxes that would arise on transfer whether by inheritance or by sale.
