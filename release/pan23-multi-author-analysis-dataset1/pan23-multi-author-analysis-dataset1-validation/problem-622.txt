If you don’t want to sign a confidentiality waiver, you can try to negotiate that as part of the settlement, but obviously that is something the company will want. I am surprised that Your lawyer has told you that your case is “open and shut” if it gets to trial. Trial is really unpredictable. Jurors could be anyone, you may get a horrible jury, and then your case being open and shut doesn’t really matter. I don’t know about Texas but a lot of states have laws saying that the losing party pays costs (filing fees, court reporter fees, etc….not attorneys fees). This is not about the contract between you and your lawyer, but based on awarding litigation costs to the winning party. I still don’t see what benefit you think it will be to have a piece of paper that says “i won after a trial”. What will you do with that?
So, I’m not concerned with publicity, but I do have an issue with the condition that if I discuss the circumstances of my employment suit with a potential employer, any settlement earnings would be revoked. My lawyer is confident we would win if we wanted to go to trial, he just doesn’t want to because we’d get less money. I however am more concerned with proving that my employer was in the wrong and being able to reference that, rather than have a stain on my record and forfeit the right to follow suit.
