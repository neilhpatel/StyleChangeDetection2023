What are you even worried about? It sounds like she's not at fault, she complied with the investigation, and the police record also reflects she's not at fault. Two years have passed without hearing anything. Car accidents aren't illegal. Do you suppose a prosecutor will look at the police records, phone search, speed, green light and think "I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she was driving recklessly?" Not even negligently, recklessly? It's not easy to convict someone of this stuff and the facts and investigation are all on your side. Deal with the actual problem of the grief of the accident. Don't call the cops, the court, the clerk or anyone else besides a therapist. I also wouldn't call a lawyer unless it's a family friend who isn't charging you. There's 0 reason to think criminal responsibility for this is going to just show up years later and there's no use running up a bill until there is a reason to worry. If the cops show up tell them you're happy to continue assisting in the investigation but your lawyer made you promise not to say a word until they were with you so I'll give him a ring and we can all discuss and move forward. Nothing is ever impossible so no one can make any promises, but if you're actually freaking out about criminal liability two years later you should stop because it's very unlikely.
Thank you. My partner tends to bottle things up so therapy is hard for them in general. I think they are using the hanging outcome as a way to deflect talking about it.
