And just so you don’t misunderstand, just because she may have acquired an asset after she made the trust, that doesn’t mean the asset was not held by the trust. For example if she made the trust in 2010 and bought a house in 2012, all she would have had to do is record a deed putting the title of the house into the name of the trust, and it becomes a trust asset, administered according to the terms of the trust after she dies. Same with a bank account: she could open an account in the name of the trust, well after she actually signed/created the trust. Hope this is helpful and best of luck.
Find a California trust attorney who practices in Santa Ana, CA (this city is the county seat of Orange County and also where the Superior Court/Probate Court is located) who will quote you a REASONABLE FEE (a couple of hundred dollars) to write a letter on your behalf (representing you) to send to the trustee to request a copy of the will and the trust. I assume that the boyfriend is the trustee and also a beneficiary. The letter should not come from just you alone because there could be a tendency from the boyfriend to disregard your request. He would be likely to take the attorney's request seriously and therefore comply.
