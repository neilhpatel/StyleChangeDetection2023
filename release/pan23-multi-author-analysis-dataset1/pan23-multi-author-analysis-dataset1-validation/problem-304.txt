In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Faith was meant to be a healthy and disciplined choice one could make to consciously build their own belief system in their own journey to contentment, peace and happiness with life, but now it has been perverted to create small armies of people who have allowed their subconscious minds to be infiltrated with bigotry, greed, and judgement, which can never help them on their journey to happiness and inner peace, but provides them with a sense of belonging, unity, tribalism, superiority, and purpose nonetheless, and is unfortunately accompanied by the same mechanism that makes traditional Faith so effective by guarding the subconscious from accepting any new information that is not aligned with these trusted belief systems.
He’s running low. A lot of attorneys won’t represent him now (there’s a joke in the legal world that says MAGA stands for “make attorneys get attorneys”).
