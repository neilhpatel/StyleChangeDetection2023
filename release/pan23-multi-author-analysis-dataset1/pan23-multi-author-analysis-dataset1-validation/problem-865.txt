Do you have access to any form of personal transportation? It isn't illegal to travel across state lines to seek medical care not available in your own state (happens a lot for abortions, as an example), and many states allow minors to be vaccinated without parental approval.
California, Delaware, Minnesota, New York, and Washinon DC all allow minors to consent to STI related vaccines like HPV without parental approval. Alaska, Idaho, Alabama, Oregon and South Carolina allow someone your age to consent to any health care treatment without parental approval, including vaccination.
Thank you. Unfortunately you cannot consent to receive any vaccines as a minor in Nebraska. Apparently you MIGHT be able to find a Title X-funded clinic which can administer some healthcare without parental consent. It might be worth seeing if one is near you, and calling them for more info.
Additionally, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana (only if you've graduated high school), Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania (only if graduated high school), South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia all have some variation on mature minor exceptions which would allow you to receive medical care without parental consent if the providers reasonably believes you are a mature minor.
Many laws in the US are different state to state. Sounds like you live in Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, or possibly half of Canada; which one is it?
