I’m not a lawyer, but have had family and friends involved in catastrophic accidents. When you are examined by a doctor, ask what long term issues you will dealing with. Broken bones/damaged joints develop arthritis much sooner than uninjured. Ask them to document this. You have to have your immediate medical needs taken care of, including mental, but with your hip broken, you may need more treatment for that in five or ten years, so ask your lawyer to include any future medical expenses caused by or related to this accident. And document everything with future doctor visits, ie “I’ve noticed my hip hurts after I walk 1 mile, 6 months ago it didn’t start to hurt until I’d walked 3 miles” -something to show the ongoing deterioration of your quality of life.
No. They will pay the bare minimum. You have injuries that will affect your entire life, and potentially, the lives of your family. You NEED a lawyer to fight for you. Not because you can't handle shit, but because lawyers are super good at dealing with insurance companies for companies that try to give you the lowest, bare minimum amount of money. They will help you get the maximum amount of money you you deserve.
