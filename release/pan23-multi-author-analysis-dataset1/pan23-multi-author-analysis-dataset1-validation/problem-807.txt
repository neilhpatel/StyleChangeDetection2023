For context, they have demanded essentially whatever rights and times the father would have received had he survived (all holidays, all summer break, ect). So, it does make sense that they would attempt to keep the original case open. The child lived with the father in an apartment over her home, and I can only assume that is the "foot in the door" for them. Their complaint states he lived with his grandmother "for many years", when in fact,he resided above the grandmother, roughly half of the time (the other half being with me and my spouse), for several years. He and his father occupied a seperate residence twice for a couple of years, during which time she also sued him for grandparents visitation and lost.
Do not agree to this. One of the things needed is for the Grandmother to prove she had meaningful contact and provided care for your child. Don't give her the tools to use against you.
I'm for what's best for the child (including visitation if the child has a relationship), but if the legal system interjects they may put conditions you may not want such as paying for half of the plane ticket or other expenses.
I'm aware. Their request for access to the records was not sent to my attorney, nor emailed/faxed. Rather it was mailed, to me personally, by snail mail. I only received it yesterday, and the hearing for that is tomorrow. My attorney got wise and is planning to attend.
