We aren't expecting to hear exactly where she is sitting. We want to know what city/state she is in (edit) so we know how safe we are in our location, and so law enforcement can have a heads up as to where she is. Thank you.
Thank you. We don't have high expectations. Just looking for the possibility of someone's success story to give us a little hope to get us through this time.
This is what we are assuming, but were hoping someone might have a better experience to share with us just to give us a little hope. Unfortunately, this individual is smart enough to be lying low (despite intending to come to the hearing). It's very frustrating how easily people can get away with breaking the law. Thanks for your answers.
Even if you got the information from Zoom in a timely manner (you wouldn't), the location could be any number of places that don't really keep track of individual users and their connections - places like fast food restaurants, libraries, hospitals, schools or local businesses. They may be smart enough to use a VPN without any record keeping and/or operate out of the country. Since the effort is futile, nobody will want to spend the time or resources to figure out where they are. Having said that, if they are stupid enough to zoom from a location that you are familiar with and recognize (a relative's house for example), feel free to share that information with the authorities - just don't expect a miracle.
