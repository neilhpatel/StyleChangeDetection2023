That may not qualify as top-notch legal advice but you won't find any here. There's no way anyone would know with this specific situation. All you can do is wait and see. I wouldn't worry though.
He does not have any of my personal information, phone number, address, name, or IP address, etc, the only information he could have given them was my social media, which is obviously very trackable. But with this being said, do you think the lack of information might turn them away? it seems unlikely because of the seriousness of the alleged crime, but I would be hopeful that they would be discouraged. I also feel that a report might not have actually gone through, since I asked for simple proof(browsing history showing ic3) which he did not give. I'm honestly very distraught by this situation. I would be very ashamed if my parents were to find out, seeing as they are very strict and I live with them, so I am just trying to figure out how this will all be handled. I digress, anyway, this despicable human has since been blocked. Thank you for your help.
