Essentially, yes, even with the necessary modifications due to Obelix being a well wrapped person, compared to others Gauls and their pants.
Excellent answer! I love that _brācātus_ meant "trouser-wearer" and hence by extension "barbarian" - Lewis & Short's _A Latin Dictionary_ even lists "effeminate", as opposed to a manly _togātus_. .
These pants were called bracatae by Romans (from Gaulish \braccas or \bragicas), and while they weren't really particular to Gauls (Medes, Persians, even Hebrews had similar trousers), they considered them specific enough of transalpine people that they nicknamed their province in southern Gaul "Gallia Bracata", the "Gaul in pants", something that both Greek and Romans found unfashionable, barbaric (being s) and silly-looking, which didn't prevent their adoption by servile and military forces of the Empire in Late Antiquity (altough still frowned upon by Italian upper classes as far as the Carolingian era).
No, sorry - I didn't mean to give the impression that I'm knowledgable on that subject. I only know basic Latin, so I went to the dictionary out of curiosity after you posted your answer. Here's the one I used, though two of its quotes are unavailable, and it was published in the late 19th century:
