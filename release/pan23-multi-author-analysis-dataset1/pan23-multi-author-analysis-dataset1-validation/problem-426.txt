Speaking of yellow water! Stacy St. Clair of the Chicago Tribune tweeted out an equally disgusting photo of that and said, “Water restored, sorta. On the bright side, I now know what very dangerous face water looks like. Sochi unfiltered.”.
Definitely… and Ozil continued to play like shit even after the World Cup… that’s why Arsenal dumped him and agreed to pay 90% of his wages ($7.38 million - He was such a negative force in the locker room that they paid him to leave) to play at Fenerbahce where he did just as bad if not worse, leaving after one year.
And hypocrites should be called out. And they should also shut up until they fix their own issues. Imagine Qatari people talking about how abortion is like killing a child when they go to Canada in four years. Seems absurd right?
Of course, other Muslim countries like the Central Asian -stans (outside of Afghanistan) and Albania/Bosnia are pretty okay for women, although I think that's the communist legacy more than any religious practice (frankly, the religion probably erodes those advances). And several Muslim-majority/near-majority African nations have women in power, education, business, etc.
He was already playing like shit for Arsenal. He did not deserve the contract extension at $350k p/week. But when he got his payday, he retired without leaving. His drama with the German FA had nothing to do with his form taking s nose dive. Even Arsene Wenger admitted that Ozils new contract put him in “the comfort zone”.
