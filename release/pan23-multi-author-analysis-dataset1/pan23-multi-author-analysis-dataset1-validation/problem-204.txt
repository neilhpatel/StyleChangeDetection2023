Gossip and slander: Mobbing ringleaders and their supporters may initiate malicious gossip designed to humiliate and undermine the victim. Sometimes, the gossip is pure slander, in others, the gossip reveals personal information about the target that may be embarrassing but has nothing to do with the victim’s professional competency. In extreme cases, these campaigns may extend outside the office and into the industry or profession in which the victim works.".
So it’s uncomfortable and I don’t even do this in the same situation, but you should follow up with emails documenting the verbal “advice” given by a supervisor or superior, the steps you took to follow that instruction, the outcome, and request for further intervention. You should also note in writing the “office meetings” where you are told to not let it bother you. If there is an HR dept or someone above that person, email a brief description of the meeting to that dept, unless there are policies and procedures otherwise. Copy yourself. Print it. Same with being told you should not take matters into your own hands...after being told the opposite. Everything should be in writing or followed up in writing with a summary of what happened, even if you use your personal time to do it. Without a paper trail of some kind it’s your word against everyone else.
