Operations managers sometimes don't understand the extent to which the employer needs to go to accommodate. I have seen many make the mistake of saying no (especially without partnering with HR/Safety/Legal/Accom) merely because it's an unusual request or due to some self-concoted BS safety or business reason.
3. What the employer canâ€™t do is deny a request without going through an interactive process. On the surface, it sounds like this has not happened.
Big picture, the company is obligated to engage in the interactive process with the employee and to approve reasonable accommodation requests if the reasonable accommodation will enable the employee to complete the primary functions of their job.
This is simply not true. There are not always alternative accommodations that are reasonable. The employer is required to be reasonable, but they are not required to suffer undue hardship, accept solutions that leave an employee unable to fulfill tasks, or to find solutions where none exist.
2. Employers do not HAVE to provide an accommodation or even offer alternatives. What they HAVE to do is go through an interactive process. Alternatives may be proposed during the interactive process only if the employer deems them as reasonable. If an accommodation provides an undue hardship, and no alternatives are available, the employer can deny the request.
