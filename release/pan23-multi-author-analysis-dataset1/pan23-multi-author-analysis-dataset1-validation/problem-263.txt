In the 1980s, people certainly continued to wear and use bright colors, but whites, off-whites, and greys became very common parts of the interior design palette, as well as glass and chrome - a space-age rebound from the historical/natural trend of the previous period. It's unsurprising that car colors would become similarly utilitarian.
1. Paints are more generally referred to as coatings. The primary job of a coating to provide longevity and stability to a substrate (i.e. the thing that you are putting the coating on). Coatings generally increase the service life of things like airplanes, ships, cars, buildings, etc by increasing the amount of time it takes for the substrate to be attacked by moisture/corrosion, UV energy from the sun, rocks and debris (think of cars rolling down the road and shooting rocks behind them) etc.
Is that where "orange peel" comes from? I'd never heard of that before getting my current car, but it's paint has significant orange peel, which definitely harms the reflectiveness of the paint when it's nice and clean. Oddly, my colleague owns another car of the same model and color, made in the same factory, but it doesn't have any orange peel.
