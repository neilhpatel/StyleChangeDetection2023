In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. I'm curious. I'd really hate for the Republican hoopla to end with "it sank". Be cool to see if China ever provides more detail. Especial if they wait until after the it sank story.

Because it was not shot down before entering US airspace from Canada, we can safely say it posed no danger and Biden was briefed on it and was advised on the current course of action of leaving it be (for reasons the public is not privy too) but they underestimated it being used politically and with a slow news cycle it blew up and then White House was forced to “take action” against something that they knew was not a threat because our military and intelligence officers said it was not. Lose lose for Biden.
It's probably nothing significant. If it were, it would have been shot down way quicker. The Chinese government said it's a research balloon that was blown off course and I honestly don't doubt it. Why would they be using a giant balloon that's visible to the naked eye to spy on the US? Satellites are insanely powerful. It just doesn't make any sense that they would be using a balloon with the resources that they have available.
