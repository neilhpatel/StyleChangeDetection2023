In this thread: Republicans who are secretly hoping Trump gets arrested so they can move on to DeSantis but also blame Democrats for unfairly locking up former president.
Exactly. The house republicans are going to interrogate and harass the shit out of him now that they can, just because. I think appointing a special counsel for that reason alone is probably a good idea, let alone the fact that trump announced he’s running for President.
Exactly. So many people keep bringing up that, if it were any ol US citizen, justice would have been served. And yes, totally true, but TFG isn’t just any ol citizen. He’s a former president and the right steps must be taken if the DoJ wants to really nail him. Today is just one of those steps.
Jack Smith, the special counsel announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland on Friday to oversee the criminal investigations into the retention of classified documents at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, has been a lonime Justice Department prosecutor.
Edit: wanted to add that there’s no way this council is “meaningless”. They’re bringing in a special prosecutor who is seemingly unbiased and highly qualified. They’re doing this so the “politically driven” defense is not as effective in court. If they brought in one of their own people, TFG can cry political party foul all day.
