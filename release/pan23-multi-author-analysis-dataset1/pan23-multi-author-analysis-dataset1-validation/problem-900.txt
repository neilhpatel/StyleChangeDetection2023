Starting with the French economy, it's true that during the Revolution, France went through an evolving economic crisis. However it's not as straightforward as saying that their economy had crashed. While the assignat, the paper currency originally intended to be notes based upon the sale of nationalized Church lands, went through significant periods of devaluation and extraordinary inflation, the "war economy" of France shouldn't be discounted.
Napoleon being Napoleon, he solved both problems. Frist, he created a few “sister republics” in Italy by dissolving a handful of unlucky sovereign states and reorganizing them. He appointed puppet governments to keep milking them for all they’re worth lead them in his stead. Seizing the initiative, Napoleon rallied a chunk of his army, defeated the Last major Austrian-held fortress at Mantua, and started marching through the Alps into lightly defended Austrian territory. It was at this point that the Austrians quickly sought a ceasefire and later a peace treaty, ending the War of the First Coalition. For more detail on his Italian campaigns, Desmond Gregory’s Napoleon’s Italy and Michael Broers’ The Napoleonic Empire in Italy both give solid accounts of his exploits there in 1796–1797.
Jumping ahead a bit to 1796, we can see Napoleon really driving this cycle onwards, culminating in the French victory in the first coalition war in 1797. Napoleon was given given command of a withering French Army on the southern border near Italy and told to shore up France’s military position while the two main French armies meandered across Germany in the general direction of Austria while trying not to die of starvation, seeing as the French government had recently informed those two armies that they government no longer had the supplies or money to support them, and that they would need to live off the land (or pillage what they needed from the people who lived there). Napoleon had other plans, and quickly revitalized his army, captured half of northern Italy, and set his sights on the Austrian heartlands just on the other side of the Alps. The French government was literally figuratively bathing in all of the priceless Italian art, loot, gold, etc., that Napoleon was having his men ship back home by the cartload, and they didn’t want the gravy train to end just yet. This money was doing wonders for the still-struggling French economy, after all. They ordered Napoleon to wait in Northern Italy and strip away everything that wasn’t nailed down. Napoleon complied for a while, but it quickly became clear that he’d have a massive revolt on his hands. He figured with a few tens-of-thousands more men he could handle the revolt, but then he wouldn’t have the manpower to guard the Alps from Austrian counter-attacks, which had been rolling in at a steady pace since he’d first begun moving into Italy.
