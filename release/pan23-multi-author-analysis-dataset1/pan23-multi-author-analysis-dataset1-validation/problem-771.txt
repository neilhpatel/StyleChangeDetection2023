It might be useful in districts where kids are having to deal with all these screwed up school issues. those elections can be won with marginal vote totals, so if there are enough students incentivized to have their voices heard on these issues, maybe it could be a good way to have their voices heard.
What I'd be more concerned about is the lobbying that would go into trying to influence the students, and while I respect teachers a lot, I do feel there may be instances where teachers have too much influence over their students to get them to vote certain ways.
I'm for it. If the median age of high turn out voters was 17 to 25 year olds, it is likely because politicians would learn that a new demographic that can pull reasonably big numbers, are worth pretending to listen to. Let's hope more forward thinking comes out of more young people being able to vote their dissatisfaction.
