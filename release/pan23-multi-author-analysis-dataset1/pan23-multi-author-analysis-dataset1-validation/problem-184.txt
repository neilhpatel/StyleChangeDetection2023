Not really, no. There is really a whole world of difference between the modern metallurgy and the metalworking processes and techniques available to people in pre-industrial era more or less anywhere. Also, speaking of Vikings, we need to observe that they did not really have that bigger access to ice or cold water, as they lived in relatively warm regions capable of supporting agriculture and the shores of the Baltic and North Sea are characterized by a relatively mild, maritime climate, with winters in the more continental regions of Europe being more severe.
2. The hardnesses you quote are typical for the hypereutectoid steel Ulfberhts (i.e., the ones that are often assumed/believed to be made from crucible steel). However, the quench-hardened pattern-welded Ulfberht swords are typically much harder. The softer ones are about 300-350HV, but the harder ones exceed 500HV. The 50-53HRC achieved by the harder ones shows what the technology of the time could do. (Heat treatment of very high carbon crucible steels is problematic when you can't temper reliably, so blades made of such steel were often air-cooled rather than quenched. If this was done for the hypereutectoid Ulfberhts, the low hardnesses are expected. Edge retention should still have been OK due to the carbides.).
I'm not really knowledgeable about marketing practices of the toolmakers, but the process known as 'ice-hardening' or 'deep freeze hardening' really exists and means bringing the worked item to very low temperatures after quenching to increase its hardness before the item is tempered. These are very often complex criogenic processes and temperatures used make them unfeasible to replicate with the the medieval methods, as they usually reach -70 to -90째C (-95 to -130째F) but may require temperatures as low as -150째C (-240째F), and mind that this is the temperature actually reached by the worked item, not just the freezing medium.
1. These are mostly thought to come from the Rhineland (or at least the "genuine" Ulfberht swords, whichever ones they might be), so they don't say much about Baltic metallurgy.
