I salute /u/sunagainstgold for a fantastic description of the influence of the United States, and especially the Wild West, on Dracula, and I won't try to add much more to it. But I wanted to stress the importance of the theme of the fear of the rise of foreign powers in general and the United States in particular in the novel. As the quote in OP's question shows, Dracula expresses a British anxiety related to the expansion of the United States (here imagined to one day reach from the Pole to the Tropics). In the 19th century, the United States had expanded tremendously in terms of territory, and continued to do so around the writing of Dracula: the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the definition of Oregon Country in 1819, the annexation of the Republic of Texas in 1845, the vast territory taken from Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, the settling of islands in the Pacific and Caribbean starting in the 1850s, and the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 all hugely increased not only the size but the geopolitical influence of the US. I can't overstate how important it was that the US, once itself a colony, was now claiming colonies of its own, and even contesting territory with the UK (including islands in the Pacific and Caribbean, and land on the border with Canada). The novel was published in 1897, and the following year saw both the annexation of Hawai'i and the Spanish-American War, which ended with Guam, the Philippine Islands, and Puerto Rico becoming US possessions. I don't claim this to be a complete timeline of US expansion, but rather I meant to show just how much US power was growing. The British, who had ended the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 feeling undisputed in Europe, now had to contend not only with a newly unified Germany and rising Russia, but also with the United States, which in the late 19th century eclipsed the UK's economy (I've seen between 1870 and 1890 in different sources). In media depictions, the United States was represented as young and strong and rising and untamed, while the UK struggled with an Empire that was proving ever more difficult to manage, widespread poverty at home and famine in the colonies, and the rising power of countries near and far.
Thanks for this answer! As a follow up, did this depiction of Slovak dress have anything to do with how actual Slovak peasants dressed at the time, or was this all just Stoker winging it?
