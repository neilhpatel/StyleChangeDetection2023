I don't think this is similar. It's not clear whether or not the actual tenant is staying there while the airbnb folks are renting.
Edit: upon further reading of OP's comments, the tenant appears to have several airbnb listings and appears to be renting these places solely to airbnb them. So this is almost certainly not the same as having a friend crash with you.
Property manager here. Is there a rule or a stipulation in your lease not to sublet or use the property as a place of business?
I would recommend changing your lease so that future tenants cannot run a business or use the property for subletting and or AirBnB or anything like that.
I would reach out to AirBnB and let them know that you are the property owner and landlord and that the former tenant did this and does not have permission to rent out the property. And explain to them that they are being evicted. Now, AirBnB may ask you to that they would keep the listing up and give you the money for the AirBnB renting. That's between you and them. But you gotta contact them like ASAP.
