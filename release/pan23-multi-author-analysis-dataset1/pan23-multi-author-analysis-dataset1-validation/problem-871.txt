That’s a solid plan just for sustainability, regardless of health implications. They are also better insulators and typically don’t impart a taste on whatever. I don’t really use silicon containers though. I can appreciate the use of plastic containers for food and water for things like backpacking for weight saving, titanium light but also is super expensive.
Obviously not. They are everywhere. Just saying it is a high cost for business. Those costs are paid in full by the future generations. Not controversial just true. We can do and be better. Includes me.
These regulatory processes often involve paperwork being submitted, rejected, resubmitted, processed, still being processed because the regulatory agency got its budget cut so they are short staffed, still being processed because they're european and all on holiday because it's now august. Got it back. Now on to stage two, oh shit US congress finally passed a bill now check and see if that changed anything oh good it didn't, wait someone in another department is on maternity leave, and oh bloody hell it's delayed because Christmas means all the government people are on holiday.
Just use cast iron or stainless steel. Use them right and there is no sticking, and you save energy because they are conductors where as teflon is an insulator.
4) Regulation. Before you start producing a new compound, especially chemicals like this, you need technical and legal experts to check and make sure it complies with all the necessary regulations. For a company like 3M, this means satisfying the regulatory requirements of dozens of different countries.
