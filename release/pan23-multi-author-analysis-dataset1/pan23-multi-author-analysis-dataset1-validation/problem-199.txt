This is kind of what I'm afraid of. The flooring rules are nonexistent, but the nuisance rules are extremely broad. Even though he says it happens at times when we're all asleep, and we're not doing anything to cause it besides breathing. We've not heard any complaints from anyone else (to the other side, above, or even below- and the below neighbor is who I'd be most interested in because that's typically where the worst noise would be expected, nada. She actually complimented us on not wearing shoes, etc.).
If their proposed resolution is insane, like forcing you to install carpet, ask for the board to impose the resolution equally onto all owners in the community via either a rule change, or budgetary accommodation (association pays full cost of changing floors, and pays for damages to your investment), in order to ensure that you are not being subject to harassment. When all other owners refuse to do it, you have justification to continue as is and pursue a harassment claim if the complaints continue.
