This wasn't a new idea, either. The 1389 Treaty of Leulingham (Hundred Years' War) was originally planned to last 3 years; it was renegotiated to 27. No one could know what the state of kingship could be at that time. As it happened, Richard II used the period of relative peace to make a lot of people very angry and get himself deposed. When Henry IV took the throne, he affirmed the truce. This shows two things: first, the idea that treaties could/should apply to successors was floating around. Second, this was an idea, not a given (a law, if you will.).
This is giving me unpleasant flashbacks to Game of Thrones season 7 when all the characters around Daenerys threw an inexplicable bitchfit because she executed two lords who she'd battled with.
