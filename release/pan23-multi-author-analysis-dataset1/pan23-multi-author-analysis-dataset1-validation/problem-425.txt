Well, Christians were instructed to go out and preach to the world…and so they did. There were Christians in China as early as the 7th century but it’s certainly possible that Christians from central Asia and India were there even earlier than that.
So, the answer is basically that Christianity had always existed in Persia, central Asia, and in India too. From there it arrived in China in the 7th century, and was brought there again by the Mongols in the 12th and 13th centuries.
Again, inaccurate. Nestorius was deposed from his position as Patriarch of Constantinople and sent into exile after Ephesus. However he never visited Persia, he retired first to his monastery outside Antioch, but in 435 was sent to Egypt, where he lived out his days in a province that despised him, far from the home he loved.

Nestorious was excommunicated and exiled to Eygpt. He died around 450 CE. According to Shelley, “To this day it remains unclear to what extent Nestorius’s teachings were actually heretical and to what extent he suffered as a victim of misunderstanding and misrepresentation” (121). His followers fled to Persia, where there was already a community of Eastern Christians that had experienced the ups and downs of persecution and favor under various governments.
I'm afraid this is a mistake. It's not "Dyaphysitism", you mean "Dyophysitism", and this was actually the Orthodox position. It was confirmed however not at Ephesus in 431 but at Chalcedon in 451 where it was accepted as opposed to "miaphysitism" or "monophysitism", which were both the position of the anti-Chalcedonians or Coptic Orthodox (their enemies called them "mono" but they say they are "mia" even to this day).
That’s fair. I guess my question is would you refer to them as Persian Christians or Syrian Christians then? Was it a group distinct form the Persian Christians already present? My sources seemed to imply so, but now I am not sure. So you have suggestions for further reading.
It was however Theodore of Mopsuestia' s teachings that were spread as "nestorian" teachings to Persia, through Edessa, a prominent theological school which was within the Roman Empire but near the border of Persia, through which the training of Persian clergy continued, despite the official Persian autocephaly (which was a political thing to prevent the Church being persecuted by the Persian Emperor as a Roman fifth column). These teachings were called "Nestorian" due to their perceived similarities with what Nestorius believed, but Nestorius was not a teacher or a theologian and had nothing to do with the creation or propagation of the teachings. The doctrine was widespread in Syria however which was where Nestorious had learned it, and it was Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyrhus, and others who believed practically the same things as Nestorius who were the ones who spread it.
