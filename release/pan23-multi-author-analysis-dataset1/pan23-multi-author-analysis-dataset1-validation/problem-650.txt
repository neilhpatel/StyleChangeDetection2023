So to start, I take your use of 'public racism' to specifically mean "Were people willing to explicitly say 'We're moving because of black people' instead of coaching it in other, coded language such as 'lower taxes' or 'better schools'?" and that the underlying dynamics of the 'White Flight' phenomenon are taken as a given. As such I won't be focusing much on that latter aspect, and instead only working to illustrate the rhetoric surrounding the phenomenon, its racialist components, and also how even the 'more material incentives' which come into the conversation as 'alternatives' (or more properly, micro-explanations divorced from macro-trends) themselves could end up being defined in explicitly racial terms (and as a side-note, for anyone reading further, hopefully it is a given, but there will be some pretty charged racial language in the quotations you find below).
Very telling, I suppose it's very clear where people stood. I expected the racial loyalty, but it's always a surprise to see just how much people identified with their neighborhood/communities (to the point that 78% of people agreed to "abide by the majority will", as the neighborhood itself was a meaningful and discrete category).

Secondly, although I understand the importance of public campaigns (and indeed, that framing was present in my original question) in discerning the intent of those involved in the phenomenon, do we have access to a more granular, micro-historical understanding of white flight, one which dives into the private lives/personal opinions of white families?

John Maggio began simply enough with speaking about the inconvenience of bussing, but soon worked toward “in my neighborhood a large amount of negroes go to the white school...and they are a disorderly bunch, rude, and the smoke, which is a bad influence for the white pupils.” Soon Maggio was defending the southern fears of “the mongrelization of the races” by stating that “such happened to Egypt, India, Greece, Rome, Phoenicia, and their civilization decayed.” Further that “The great civilizations of the ages have been produced by the Caucasion race.” Just in case the Superintendent missed his point, he added to the side that “segregation is a fundamental Divine Principle that applies to individual and to nations and races. Deuteronomy XXXII verse 8. Intermarriage is a sin.”.
Historians in a few generations are going to be presented with such an interesting problem when (praise be to the internet archivists) they have access to so many expressions of opinion on the individual level about anything and everything as they write histories of the early 20th century, but for this period we're still stuck with that old conundrum of 'what sources can we expect?' and while there might have been a few weirdos out there, most families don't record the minutes of their dinner-time conversations! So this is the kind of things that we have to rely on what there is. That isn't to say there aren't ways to peer, with memoirs and the like, but even something like a diary or a collection of letters aren't always going to be readily accessible for the historical record when we're talking events for which many who lived through it are still alive, so a truly broad, survey level study might not be (yet) possible.
Others also employed this logic. Mrs. Kasperonich argued that her children deserved to go to a local school because “we...pay my taxes...and helped to built it [the school] up like other people.” Corinne O’Brien stated the logic of these letter writers most clearly when she wrote, “What is the sense of working to provide a decent home for our children in a decent neighborhood, which is perhaps so not because of the color of anyone’s skin, but because the individuals strive and work that much harder and conscientiously to make it so.” Though stating that the cause was not race, she nevertheless accepted that Blacks might not live in a “decent neighborhood” because of their failure to “strive and work that much harder.” Elizabeth and George Biggart wrote that “We work and keep off the welfare rolls in order to pay high rent and keep our children in respectable surroundings.” They went further by noting their own superior morality to that found in Black communities when they wrote that “There is no money left over in THIS family for booze, night life or ‘good times’ but as parents we couldn’t care less as long as our children grow into good citizens.” These statements make clear that numerous white parents felt that their own schools were good BECAUSE of their own superior morality and work ethic whereas those in Black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods were poor because of a failure to act morally by sacrificing for their children.
