Portraying Glantz as a guy who is just out to extol the success of the Red Army is just not a fair assessment of his works. I would say instead that Glantz is making the information within of Soviet sources available to English speaking audiences often in formidable detail. I don't read Russian, but I've never heard of Glantz having been shown to have misused or misunderstood his Soviet source material, (he's probably made some mistakes just because who could write so much without a mistep, but overall he's considered reliable). Also, Glantz doesn't seem to pull punches critiquing the Red Army, just look at his titles and subtitles! "Stumbling Colossus: The Red Army on the Eve of World War", "Kharkov 1942: Anatomy of a Military Disaster", "Zhukov's Greatest Defeat: The Red Army's Epic Disaster in Operation Mars, 1942 ", "Red Storm Over the Balkans: The Failed Soviet Invasion of Romania, Spring 1944 " Do these titles sound like a man who is out to Whitewash the Red Army?
5. I may come back and add more on this, but for a rich primer text on the extensive nature of this debate, see Glantz, Soviet Military Operational Art:In Pursuit of Deep Battle, Ch. 4 in particular. Since this post revolves around "is Glantz reliable" I also offer up Richard Simpkin & John Erickson's somewhat dated Deep Battle: The Brainchild of Marshal Tukhachevskii, Richard Harrison's Architect of Soviet Victory in World War II: The Life and Theories of G.S. Isserson, Chapter 2 of Alexander Hill's The Red Army and the Second World War, and Chapters 5 and 6 of Naveh's In Pursuit of Military Excellence. Honestly, the debate is so central to understanding the Red Army that any of the texts I've cited so far will have at least a paragraph or two on the debate: Chapter 1 of When Titans Clashed, the subsection 'Military Structures' in Ch.2 of Thunder in the East, to name a couple.
