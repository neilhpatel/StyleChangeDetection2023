The emergence of Clausewitz as the Western theorist par excellence was not an instantaneous affair. Clausewitz was but one of many writers in the wake of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars who sought to grapple with the vast changes in warfare brought about by the emergence of ideologically-driven citizen armies across Europe. During the wars, Archduke Charles of Austria, who was commander-in-chief of the Austrian army in 1809 and inflicted Napoleon's first battlefield defeat at Aspern-Essling, made some of the first major attempts at this with the Grundsätze der Kriegskunst (Principles of the Art of War) in 1806 and the Grundsätze der Strategie erläutert durch die Darstellung des Feldzugs 1796 (Principles of Strategy Explained through the Example of the Campaign of 1796) in 1814. Clausewitz's great Francophone competitor, Antone-Henri Jomini, a staff officer under Napoleon, wrote a treatise on grand tactics in 1805, and his magnum opus, the Précis de l'Art de la Guerre (Summary of the Art of War), in fact postdated Clausewitz, being published in 1838, seven years after Clausewitz's death in 1831 (the complete but unedited On War was published by his wife and editor, Countess Maria von Brühl, in 1832.).
Several Chinese acquaintances from my university circkles have expressed surprise that I (or other Swedes/Westerners) have even heard of the Sunzi Bingfa, because they regarded it as quite obscure and unpopular compared to the _Analects_, _Daodejing_, _Yijing_, _Shiji_, and other Classical Chinese works.
