I think that the premises of your question may put the focus slightly off. The issue of Prussian VS Austrian hegemony in the unification process is very well documented in a lot of books (even any textbook) but was only one of the debates surrounding the question. The other major one was what kind of state and on which bases such a state would work once a unified Germany came to be and the pivotal moment of the debate is traditionally put on the meeting of the German conference in Frankfurt in 1848. This meeting was largely dominated by liberal moderates that initially had risen against the post-napoleonic order established in 1815. During 1848 all German monarchs were facing massive upheaval in their state and their reaction was largely the same: send in the troops. While the revolutionaries were crushed in bloody slaughter the moderate in Frankfurt faced massive problems in imposing any kind of power on the disunited states of Germany. The result was that by 1849 Austria, initially favoured, did not want to compromise on her hegemony and the delegates turned to the King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, as a potentially more confederation-oriented monarch than the Austrian Emperor. However, the King refused the offer because it would bind him to a constitution that he had no significant part in planning. Therefore, the project effectively collapsed until Prussia did not effectively managed the unification fairly autonomously.
So, I get that now. This is very useful, thank you. In the video that I watched, they make it clear that Bismarck was trying to keep such annexations from occurring.... But weren't these, like, very small territories? Why not just annex them militarily and then try to separate German unity? It appears (to me) that unification was probably a cultural slope that Germany had already begun to play out by the time Bismarck was around; wouldn't the other superpowers have realized that and sought to quickly control it, rather than giving the Germans time to bolster up their theoretical unity? Is that already what Austria was trying to do, as well? Thank you.
The Zollverein was the economic element of the Bismarckian project to unify Germany – much as the European Union creates economic integration without political integration.
Hey, this makes a lot of sense. Thank you. I think I get confused because I sometimes tend to read texts that inform me about such historical events, but that oftentimes the interpretation I get is one watered down to try to translate a previous thinker's ideology into our present state of the current of historical thought. So "Extra History" says: "Bismarck... always.... has... a plan." about things where it's like they're saying, "Yeah, Bismarck did this interesting stuff and it appears to have always made some sort of sense; but you're going to find it more entertaining if we leave stuff out to make the mystery appear more culturally relevant to you." And then I get lost and confused...
It is important to understand German unification in the historical context of the geopolitics of that historical period and preceding historical periods. This geopolitics was defined by the threat posed to Prussia and other small German fiefdoms by the great powers; this threat resulted in the Prussian strategy of annexing surrounding territories to bolster its strenh and support its self-preservation.
In this context, every German fiefdom (and its monarch or leader) had as its primary concern its very existence – geographically, Germany was surrounded by great powers, France to West, Russia to East. And the desire of these great powers was to annex the territory of the smaller German fiefdoms.
