Third, ask the rental agency to “skip trace” the vehicle and confirm whether or not it was actually re-rented after your rental. This seems like a no-brainer but you would be amazed at the number of employees who don’t utilize this option. If the trace confirms that it was rented out after you rental, then they obviously have the vehicle and you are no longer responsible.
First, confirm that the vehicle information on the receipt matches the car that you actually rented. Sometimes when the rental counters are busy, they will assign a vehicle to a particular rental in advance. Especially for frequent members who have opted into the fast track options (like Member accounts). And sometimes they end up assigning the wrong vehicle, need that particular one for a different reservation, or the customer received an upgrade but they forgot to change the info on the contract.
Fair point. The news articles I was reading said in all instances of people having issues, the contracts were extended. I didn't extend my contract for this one.
It's possible someone entered the vehicle information in incorrectly. I know with us occasionally a VIN will be attached to the wrong person's rental agreement because someone hit the wrong key or transposed a number.
