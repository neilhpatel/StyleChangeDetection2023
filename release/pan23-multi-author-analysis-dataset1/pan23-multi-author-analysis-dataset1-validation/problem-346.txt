The idiots are able to be convinced that a $6 gallon of gas, despite worldwide shortages, must necessarily be the intention of evil Democrats, and the irony of those same idiots driving "coal rollers" that get 7 mpg escapes them. Murdoch, et. al. saw profit to be made by using America's own idiocy against itself in a kind of Stupidity Judo. And now America has fallen down and it can't get up, on account of the morbid obesity. Really, it's a glandular issue. Don't laugh. Just get my mobility scooter, goddamnit!
