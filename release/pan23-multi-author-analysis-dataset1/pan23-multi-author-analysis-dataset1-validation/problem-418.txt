There's a couple of different ways to answer your question and I'll defer to those who are more familiar with Germany post-Word War II to speak to more specifics but I can speak to some general moves made by the German education system, especially post-unification.
To your question as it how well it went, education historians have differing takes on the success of the re-education of the German population went after the war, especially with regards to American involvement. For every strongly-worded essay I found where the historian declared it a success, there was one calling it a failure. We can look to the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a sign of failure but we can also look to the continued conversation in German schools about the Holocaust, the role of personal responsibility towards those with less power, and moral autonomy as a sign of success.
Thank you for your response. It sounds like concerted effort was made to diminish the binary of monster and human that unfortunately occupies much of non-German popular discourse about Nazism. It's interesting that it seems as though alternative binaries still emerged in post-Nazi Germany to sublimate individual and societal guilt. I'm thinking specifically about the myth of the clean Wehrmacht. That Wehrmacht soldiers were distinguished to an outrageous degree from the (Waffen-)SS. I hear this is still considerably popular, albeit not generally publicly affirmed, especially among western German Boomers—largely the immediate children of Wehrmacht soldiers.
So, back to Europe. The education center at Auschwitz-Birkenau was founded in 1947 and from the beginning, the head of the Department of Museums and Monuments in the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art, Ludwik Rajewski, who steered the project into existence focused on the ideas of "moral autonomy" and maintaining humanity. This second idea referred to both the humanity of those held prison inside its walls and put to death, but also the humanity of the guards and those who made the decisions that led to the Holocaust. This wasn't necessarily about offering grace or forgiveness, but rather to make it plain they were people who made choices. And those choices led to the rise of the Nazi Party, to the Holocaust, to the death of millions.
fascinating! if you wouldn’t mind, there was one point in your write-up that i am hoping you might be willing to explain a bit more (emphasis added):
