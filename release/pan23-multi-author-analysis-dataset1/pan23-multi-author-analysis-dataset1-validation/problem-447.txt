The turn-of-the-century revival went hand-in-hand with the contemporary revival of interest in folk-dancing, folklore and popular traditions among an urban elite. The peasantry had not really worn these outfits since the early 1800s. Yet for instance in the Swede Anders Zorn's painting , everyone's wearing one. Because it's staged of course. Zorn himself was a major _folkdräkt_ promoter. You'll find plenty of _folkdräkter_ at midsummer celebrations _today_, not least due to that painting. He also used the fortune he gained as a portrait artist to American VIPs (President Taft, Andrew Carnegie etc) to buy up a lot of folk art and objects and left a literal museum of it all to the world (Zorngården). An even greater collector than Zorn, Arthur Hazelius, gathered buildings and artifacts to create Skansen, the first open-air museum of its kind, and the Nordic Museum in Stockholm. _Slöjd_, traditional peasant crafts (woodworking and sewing mostly) was made a mandatory school subject so that those crafts would not be lost. (and remains to this day in Nordic countries).
But this is not what happened in Norway either. They did not pick up a single local tradition; people wear bunader based on many different kinds of _folkedrakt_. So what was the point there?
To some extent, although the intent behind Cornish folk dress is the opposite of creating a pan-English identity - it's geographically English, but not culturally. I've seen people suggest that historical reenactment attire is the closest thing to folk dress for countries that don't have an official one, though.
You're getting caught up on the idea of a uniform being necessary to call something national folk dress, but that's not what typically happens in countries with folk dress. Instead there is variation within the country by region or even city, and similarity to neighboring countries, because they are at least to some extent based on the actual clothing that was once worn by the peasantry across Europe, which was not based on municipal or national borders. Saying that.
There's a pan-Swedish "sverigedräkt" was constructed in 1902, but the purpose was not at all to replace local ones; quite the contrary - it was created by a society who promoted _folkdräkter_ ; rather it was intended as an outfit for people who originated in areas that had no _folkdräkt_ custom, or some other reason not to wear a local one. (unlike other _folkdräkter_ it was quickly forgotten and brought back in the 1970s and in the 1980s made an official national form of folkdräkt).
