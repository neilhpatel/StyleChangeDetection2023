Every over-21 adult on the boat could be cited for providing alcohol to minors; police don't have to create logically consistent sets of citations and could leave it to a court to sort out.
Yes. You ID them and don’t let them drink without proper identification and proof of being 21 or older. Not sure any other way you could do that because I don’t really think law enforcement would care if you all got caught on a boat where everyone can see who’s drinking, they would probably expect all the adults present to be responsible and use due diligence and ensure everyone was of age that is drinking.
It’s a possibility anyone or everyone involved over 21 that saw the alcohol being purchased for and being provided to the minor(s) and consumed by the minors and did nothing to stop it could face aiding and abetting charges if caught by law enforcement, being on a boat I’d assume there will be a higher patrol presence on the water due to it almost being the 4th of July and people are out on the water more.
Edit: I should also add that law enforcement around these times (4th of July) are more likely to stop a boat on the water just to check it out and make sure there isn’t anything going on that shouldn’t be going on cause of a higher risk of boating while being drunk during these holidays.
Not on private property/a house but it is certainly a good chance for law enforcement to stop a boat to inspect it especially during this time of the year where drunk boating increases. And after that if they ID everyone and there’s underage drinking occuring, they’re screwed. I have personally seen this happen in reality with boaters on a lake around the 4th.
