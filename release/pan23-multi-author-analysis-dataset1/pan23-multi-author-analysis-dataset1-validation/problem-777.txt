Truly need your state to know how to answer. Without it, and shooting from the hip, most states have a public indecency type law to protect people (largely children) from being exposed to things that generally only happen in the privacy of the home. It is likely under that sort of statute that you are being charged. (Also, it would help to know what youâ€™re being charged with.).
I have no answer for the nudity questions (although if I as a man am allowed to chop wood without a shirt there is no question in my mind that a woman shouldn't have the same freedoms), but this is a perfect example of why you never ask a police officer for legal advice. Some don't know the law at all, the vast majority aren't trained in the finer points of the law, and all have no need to be trained in the finer points of the law. They have department protocols that tell them to do certain things, and the rest they have to wing it (they aren't lawyers, nor should they be). It's legal for them to be wrong, and if you break a law it doesn't matter what a police officer has told you is legal.
