at its height stretched from the river Sindh in Pakistan to Nubia south of today's Egypt. I am not sure from where they get "127 provinces"; the empire was divided into twenty-odd "Lands", commonly known as _satrapies_ due to the Governor being referred to as the _xshaca-pawan_ or _protector of royal power_, but it is certainly conceivable that some lower-level administrative divisions could make it all sum to over a hundred provinces. Xerxes' father, Dareios, had built a great palace in Susa, one of the many building works he undertook after implementing his administrative reforms and taking in an absurd amount of tribute, and this must be the citadel referred to in Esther.
Certainly. We are limited by the paucity of overall sources. The only primary source that identifies the destruction of a major temple(s) at that time is Herodotus, but given the size of the Persian empire it could have been any number places.
I have read that the destruction of the temple mentioned in the Persepolis Inscriptions could refer to the destruction of the Acropolis during the second Persian invasion.
