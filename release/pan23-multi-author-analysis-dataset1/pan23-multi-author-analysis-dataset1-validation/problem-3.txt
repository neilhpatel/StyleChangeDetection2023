In the 1970s, the US tried to intervene several times to keep France from sending sensitive and dual-use nuclear technology to Pakistan. It was moderately successful at this. Pakistan was able to acquire the technology through other means, including the smuggling of centrifuge information from the West European company URENCO by A.Q. Khan.
My understanding is that the CIA regards Pakistan as the biggest loose-nuke threat in the world today, and at one point referred to Pakistan as "the most dangerous country in the world" due to the loose-nuke threat there (I assume that the loose-nuke threat was what motivated that striking comment, anyway). Everyone knows that it's a terrorism hotbed, and that their military has issues with jihadist-infiltration. Hence, there is a lot of concern about a loose-nuke due to that infiltration.
Richelson says the information came "probably largely from human intelligence and communications intercepts." So it might be people on the ground, it might have been signals intelligence (decryption, etc.). Unclear.
