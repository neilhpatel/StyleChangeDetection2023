This comment explains the HIPPA portion perfectly. Voluntarily divulging your own personal patient information outside of a clinical setting is on the individual who gave the info, not on the individual who solicited it. If she had asked for these volunteers and they said no on formal paperwork regarding private information AND then she had divulged it to the class, there may (under certain circumstances) have been a violation, but just soliciting for volunteers is not.
3. It does not sound like she was fired, which would indicate that she lost permanent employment. Generally, even when you are tenured, the ability to pick up extra classes during break periods is extra service - and the way they are allocated may be specificed in contract, or it may just simply say it is at will of the department.

She may be violating the University’s policy on student employees. If the university policy is not to ask vaccination status when hiring students for on campus jobs, she may be in trouble for that. If the lab assistants are unpaid and just working for experience this wouldn’t be the case. Either way she needs a lawyer.
If she is still being told that she has a position to return to in the fall, she was nit fired; and the next step is to check if the university has (1) particular rules already stated about asking about vaccination status (2) what the contracts in place say about the assignment of extra service courses. Based on that, she needs to reach out her union rep.
