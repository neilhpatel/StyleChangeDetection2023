This quite old, but worth a read, as much of it holds true today: (It's paywalled, so if you don't have access, the argument is basically that unless you have some other means of financial support (spouse, trust fund, lottery winnings, etc.) it's a bad idea to go to grad school in the humanities.).
The most common road towards a PhD and teaching position - at least from my personal experience - is to excel as a student at a university, assist the professor and wait until an opportunity arises. That's not a guaranteed career path though, so I would only advise that route if you are truly passionate about researching. I would even go as far as to say that in most people who are pursuing a PhD in social sciences are largely motivated by personal growth and not mostly not too concerned with the potential career opportunities that may come with it. I honestly think that some high school teachers have quite a bit of room to adapt the curriculum to their own sensibilities. Really depends on the school and country I suppose.
