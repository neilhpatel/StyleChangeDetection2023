I dont see him having a real shot again. In 2016 he ran against a super unpopular candidate and had the advantage of never being in office before. Normally this would be a liability but with Trump he was seen as an outsider who would fix things. We now have 4 years of Trump on file and it wasnt good. People that said "oh well once he's president he will start acting the part" in 2016 have no excuses this time. We know exactlty who this guy is.
