This question is a little problematic to answer because what survives today is not necessarily the same as what was common 600+ years ago. What was "common" was unlikely to have been preserved because it was used as a working tool. We wouldn't know conclusively exactly how polished an average weapon would have been because so few of the "average weapons" survive in mint condition, not just because of use, but because of time. An average weapon likely would have been used until it was unusable, sold and the metal re-purposed for something else. Else it was lost, and it has rusted away.
A major function of traditional sword-making with laminated blades is to make pre-modern heat treatment more reliable (especially tempering, reducing the brittleness of the blade after quenching). Also, differential hardening. Both lamination and differential hardening are famously used in traditional Japanese sword-making. Rather than being special Japanese techniques, they were widely used around the world, and in some cases still are. (Most Medieval European differential hardening of swords appears to have been by slack-quenching, using the residual heat to auto-temper the blade.).
Likewise, while you see some dedicated swordsmiths and cutlers working to reproduce prop weapons based on actual historical sources and references, you also get a lot of "fantasy" weapons - the swords in the Conan the Barbarian movies and the Lord of the Rings films for example may draw inspiration from some real-life designs, but are often designed more for visual appeal than functionality (ask any swordsmith and they'll tell you that you don't cast a sword and quench it in snow as you see in the opening of Conan the Barbarian, nor do you "reforge" a sword by trying to splice the two broken halves back together, unless you're a magical elf apparently).
Follow up question. Is it know approximately how long it would take a smith to make a sword blade? IE 100 hours of labor or something?
To tack onto this, it's important to remember that a lot of the swords and sword-like objects in contemporary film and television are often not hand-forged from raw materials by traditional methods or sharpened as actual weapons would be - because that is time-consuming, expensive, and the props actually have to be used on set, usually by actors who have limited training in their use and with the safety of everyone in mind. So a good deal of those swords may be aluminum, or cut from sheet steel and ground down the correct profile.
