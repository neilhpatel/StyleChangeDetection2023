In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Thank you. “Went on the attack” would be a better title. I opened this thinking he physically attacked a reporter or ripped her microphone away or something with the way they worded the title. What bait!
I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...
out of jail. As he has proven over and over , when you are president they let you commit treason, attack the US Government, they let you sell the nuclear codes, they let you golf 4 days a week and pay you and 50 person entourage to stay at your own golf course, they let you sell pardons to criminals for a million bucks. It is a glorified get out of jail free for all.

The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.
