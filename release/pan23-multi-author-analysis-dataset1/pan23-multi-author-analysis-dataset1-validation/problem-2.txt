Also, I'm hoping that enough of the usual Fox News people are there while it is happening and that the cameras are rolling as we watch their smug expressions turn horrified as it slowly dawns on them that they are in fact the bad guys.
Dr.Frakenstein? Your monster is here and he's really fucking up the place. You got a leash or something? No? Well that's a shame.
Definitely. The typical GOP strategy isn't going to work when Trump already operates on the fringe. He believes he is the party. He doesn't give a shit what "Republican brass" do or offer.
Exactly. They're not dumb. Trump will have his day before Desantis, and if they get him to win in 2024 then they'll be free to have Desantis in 2028. They're excellent at the long game.
I hope Trump, on the day the GOP is going to announce their 2024 Presidential candidate, with DeSantis in the lead, holds a rally and tells his followers that the primary was stolen from him by the deep state and that they need to march into that conference and take back their country.
