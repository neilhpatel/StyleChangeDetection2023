"\[The study of Etymology\] demands profound erudition, whether we are dealing with the large number of \[Latin\] words which are derived from the Greek, more especially those inflected according to the practice of the Aeolic dialect, the form of Greek which most nearly resembles Latin."2.
Can you comment on whether Indians recognized similarities with Iranian languages though? Copied from a previous answer:
"The language spoken by the Romans is neither utterly barbarous nor absolutely Greek, but a mixture, as it were, of both, the greater part of which is Aeolic; and the only disadvantage they have experienced from their intermingling with these various nations is that they do not pronounce all their sounds properly."1.
It is well recorded in Sanskrit literature as early as the Mahabharata (300 BC) that the Sakas (Scythians) were a fallen tribe of Kshatriyas (warrior caste) that lost their status as Aryans after failing to perform Vedic ritual and using incorrect (non-Sanskrit) speech.
I love that last anecdote. What is the consensus on the reality of the result? Is it just wishful thinking or some kind of bias in hearing a familiar word?
