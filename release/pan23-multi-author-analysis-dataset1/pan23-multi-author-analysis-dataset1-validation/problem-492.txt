In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
yeah and so am i lol. I believe it was a serious proposal, I just also question the motives of whomever was on this committee.

And it'll work.
