They deleted it and then added a long sentence saying criminals can be ordered to do community service or other programs that historically have been used for reformation and rehabilitation. Sounds to me like this was a nothing change and the status quo of slavery prison work programs are going to remain. Why include that sentence at all in a slavery amendment if itâ€™s not meant to be a carve-out?
Why include this in the amendment at all if it's not meant to be a carve-out for slavery? Why not just strike out the old language and be done with it? Oregon's constitutional article on "Slavery and involuntary servitude" now has a sentence empowering the courts to force criminals into court ordered programs. It definitely sounds like a criminal exception to slavery to me.
