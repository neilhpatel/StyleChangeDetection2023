Well, it's definitely still a point of some dispute, that's for sure. I'll focus on Germany primarily, and I'll leave old Benito to someone else.
It is mostly a shoddy collection of anecdotes relating to high bureaucracy and industrialists meetings and complaints of the various government and military arms that constantly found themselves starved of the needed resources, occasionally peppered with some useful figures and graphs, that completely fails to address the reader's need of a straightforward and credible narration, instead relying on constant and useless rants about "inefficiencies" and "bureaucratic infightings". You'll have to find by yourself the most likely explanation for all the facts listed in the book.
This approach, dubbed FÃ¼hrerwirtschaft, 'leader economy', connected the advantages of a centrally-run military industrial machine like in Stalin's Soviet Union with several advantages of the free capitalist system: Decentralization, delegation and self-management within the business straightened out bureaucratic waiting periods and attracted international approval. In fact, the psychological effect of the partial economic freedoms granted to domestic and even foreign businesses gave the German fascists a way better international reputation than the Russian communists could have ever hoped for.
Overall I found the book extremely tedious and inconclusive. That's however a persistent problem in a extremely difficult and extremely marginal topic such as military production history, that involves a host of different knowledges and has to deal with limited material. However, overall, I found the US gov't books about the American industrial effort MUCH more exhausting and well written.
