NYC employment lawyer. Not your lawyer, not your friend’s lawyer, this is not meant to constitute legal advice or establish an attorney client relationship.
Tell your friend to speak to a NYC employment lawyer, specifically a plaintiff’s lawyer. Should be able to get a free consultation. Most plaintiff’s attorneys in this area work on contingency, but there are also fee shifting statutes at play here so your friend shouldn’t have to pay anything, and may not even have money taken out of her winnings should she bring and win in a lawsuit.
Thank you. Yes, I'm asking her to save all screenshots and hopefully recordings. She has had multiple calls with HR, in which they said the calls are being recorded. I hope they aren't lying about that.
It is therefore a bit more suggestive of an issue if this manager is repeating the behavior and not receiving more severe discipline, though, again, you have not clarified if his behavior has stopped after being reported this time or not.
