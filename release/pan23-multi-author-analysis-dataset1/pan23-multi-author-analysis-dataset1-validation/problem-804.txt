Pandemics affect dense environments most. Dense urban environments lean left. Trump administration guaranteed the pandemic would hit the states. It's not a big stretch.
I have a feeling that it'll probably be some combination of the two, like it started as a natural mutation of a zoonotic disease, someone with the disease was analyzed in 'a lab' of some description, and that facility had some kind of accidental containment breach like improper handling or something mundane like that.
Why would Q target Trump? That's his cult. Follow the dates. He had weeks to cut travel from China and Europe and refused to do so until it was already here. Then his entire media base called it a hoax while pushing anti-mask agenda and telling people to take fucking horse medicine lol. They did everything they could to harm the US public - that's a fact. The ONLY question now is intent, which I'm asserting was intentional as a desperate move to swing the election.
exactly. so many people completely lack any capacity for nuance, which makes discussing this so difficult.
