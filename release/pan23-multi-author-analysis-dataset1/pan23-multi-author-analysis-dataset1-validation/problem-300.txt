So a decades old plane used for transport and surveillance is threatening their active duty fighter jets?
Produce your "internationally recognized legal definition". I'm pretty sure you are just wrong. One thing to keep in mind is that "captured spies" are tried on the basis of the laws of the nation they violated, not any kind of international system. I think YOU are confusing diplomatic traditions with nonexistent "international law".
Yeah they are. They should be with trillions of dollars flowing into the country over the past 65 years. Just to save corporations money and get bigger salaries for CEOs. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What did the US think was going to eventually happen pouring money into the country in the name of cheap labor and factories. That they were going to ask to join NATO?! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
I‚Äôm not sure what the poster meant by illegal shipment, and the US does not have authority over the world, but the US does have export laws and ‚Äî using the poster‚Äôs example ‚Äî an embargo against North Korea, so if a US flag vessel is carrying goods to North Korea, the US government has the right to enforce its embargo.
Is he the one who banned Winnie the Pooh because he looks like him? Communist countries just have an inferiority complex, a bruised ego because their way of life sucks and doesn't work and they know it doesn't work and their small dick complex forbids them from admitting it so they constantly stage dick measuring contests with the West.
No. Unless you quote international law on the subject, you are just guessing and your guesses don't make sense. The only thing that matters is the status of the airspace. Inside or outside of control. As for happenstance forcing a surveillance craft to enter controlled space in a emergency, northing protects it other than diplomatic good will. Plane type, color or some official role designation doesn't make it "safe" because it can say it wasn't "spying".
We don't paint military combat aircraft black. There have been some stealth craft that are black due to their special materials but given a choice of any color, two-tone is actually most common. One color for those seeing it from above (other aircraft) and another color for being seen from the ground. For a long time, whites and light blues were standard under-coatings for craft that wished to be harder to see.
