These institutes were very close to power however. They provided policy advice to the State organs, their staffs were members of the Communist Party and in many cases, part of the Central Committee - the ruling body with direct access to the political leadership of the country. On top of that, some Instituteniki were also close advisors to the Soviet leaders themselves. As such, throughout the 1960's, 70's and early 80's, ''a network of young academics and apparatchiks was firmly entrenched within the system,'' who were of ''liberal, reformist opinion.''.
I am led to wonder though, and I'm sorry if this is stepping outside the bounds of your knowledge (and also history, since it's a theoretical question), but do you suppose a similar process might be taking place within the People's Republic of China? The primary leaders of that country seem to be getting rather old, and I can't help but wonder if the generations that have grown up under a rather brutal market economy and witnessed the reforms of Deng Xiaoping and the Tienanmen Square massacre might now themselves be silently climbing the hierarchy of the CCP, ready to take the reigns when Xi Jingping or his successor dies.
