If he’s fired without cause he’s likely eligible for unemployment. If the change in pay is drastic he might qualify for under employment. Either scenario it’s apply and see.
Indiana's higher courts have recognized that an employer's unilateral change in working conditions may not be so unreasonable as to compel a reasonably prudent person to quit, such as when an employee received a demotion that was justified by substandard work performance or when an employer alters certain working conditions in an attempt to make the best of a difficult economic situation. See, e.g., Davis v. Ind. Dep't of Workforce Dev., 900 N.E.2d 488, 494 (Ind. Ct. App. 2009); Best Chairs, Inc. v. Ind. Dep't of Workforce Dev., 895 N.E.2d 727, 732 (Ind. Ct. App. 2008); Quillen, 468 N.E.2d at 242.
While I completely agree with you, because the company was acquired, and because he flat out threatened either firing or putting him on street commission, we’re on sure what would happen if he actually did follow through. His boss tends to have outbursts like these, but in the past hasn’t followed through. But, he never directly threatened to fire anyone before.
