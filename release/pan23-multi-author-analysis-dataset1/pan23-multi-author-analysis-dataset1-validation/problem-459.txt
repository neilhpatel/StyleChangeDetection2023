I would document everything, you need to discuss this with each detail without getting upset- so practice is my advice. Just be firm in your stance and do not let it get brushed aside with excuses- which is why documenting it all is key. If they do try and say that it "needed" to be this way for this or that reason, then make sure that a case or complaint is opened, and then bring in a licensed separate contractor to go over the work done, write up why (if it's the case) it is poor workmanship and not necessary for this type of install to have happened, and get an estimate for the repair, and send that to them.
If, after those completed steps, they still refuse to send out a new person or pay to have a contractor of your choice (the route I would press hardest for given your likely very legitimate lack of faith in their own process) to come and fix the issues, THEN it would be time to involve a lawyer. More likely than not, given time isn't a high enough value issue to likely get a lawyer to do it where it makes sense for you to do so, as there will be no guarantee I the end the company would pay your legal fees- keeping in mind these conglomerates have much deeper pockets than the average family, even well-off families, and they often try to ride out litigation as to bleed the other person dry rather than openly admit fault once a lawyer gets involved. If you have a family member or friend who is a lawyer and, again, if it gets to it, can send in a letter with their own letterhead discussing the appraisal for fixing the work and why it was not done correctly and what mistakes are blatantly obvious, then it MAY be enough to motivate them to go ahead and settle versus fight it out on behalf of a third party contender (the person who did the install).
Thanks for your response! I’m sure you’re right. We had already opened a work order with Lowe’s to not only fix the microwave but also to assess the cabinet damage for compensation. They just diminish the severity of the situation, as I’m sure they’re trained to do, and tip toe around any kind of resolution. We’re waiting for the next steps but if this doesn’t yield in a fixed microwave and cabinet or compensation for the cabinet, we’re trying to figure out if we could do anything else.
