From what I could find it was not uncommon to build causeways and moles to island cities, however it cannot be said that this was widely used due to most cities being on the mainland. However for those cities with moats it was usual for the attackers to fill sections of the moat with rocks to allow troops to enter the city. These moles also took a significant amount of rocks and time to construct so if the attackers did not have the proper supply or time available then they might not build a mole even though they knew it would allow them steady access to the city and instead opt out for a naval assault.
I wrote about this ! What Achilles does in Troy would have been completely outrageous to the Classical Greeks: looting a temple, dragging priests away from the cult statue where they have placed themselves as suppliants, and desecrating one of the images of the god. All of these acts were thought of as the most severe sacrilege. That said, the world of the Iliad didn't have monumental temples or statues, so this whole element of the story was added for the film.
