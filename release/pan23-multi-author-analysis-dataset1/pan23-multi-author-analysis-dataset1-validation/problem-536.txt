This is a really interesting, albeit quite politically charged topic. I will start by addressing each of the claims.
Especially when your main source material is Jean-Clément Martin, who often makes the claim that Robespierre was firm in his opinions, but not "radical" in comparisons to other factions (the Exagérés for example), often making compromises (reluctantly accepting war and the execution of Louis for instance).
It does indeed make a difference. Establishing a firm number for the death toll of the Terror is, and has been since the start, very debated. A good reference within this debate is Martin's "La terreur Vérités et légendes.".
It seems to me that in Martin's works, Danton (also a Montagnard) is often described as way more radical in his approach of government, most notably by his support (or sometimes refusal to condemn) for spontaneous riots and massacres (De l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace).
Thank you for this addition. I don't disagree with your points. Indeed, compared to others within the Montagnards, Robespierre was not always the most radical, neither were the Montagnards at the most radical end of the spectrum.
