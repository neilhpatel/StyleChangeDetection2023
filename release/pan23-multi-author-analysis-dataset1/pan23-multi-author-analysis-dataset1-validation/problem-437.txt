All the things I've seen Russia do lately, have only cemented my impression that Russia's weapons they describe as protecting their "national interests", in reality are made to function as instruments of coercion that enable Russia to pursue their outdated imperialistic ambitions and agenda. They want to be potentially able to reach and bomb everyone everywhere so that no one can interfere with their agenda, which as we have seen, can totally include invading a neighbouring state, should they suddenly decide so. Russia has always been very precise to word itself as protecting their sovereignty and borders, but what they're actually doing vs. what they keep talking about is not a defensive doctrine at all, it totally only feigns one.
Wow. You are really underestimating the complexity of the problem. Our patriot batteries aren’t even 100% against current missiles. And they are the envy of the world. They are a combination of multiple satellites, ground stations… they are complex and require highly trained personnel. Faster missile less time to react, harder to track, harder to hit. I don’t know how to explain that more simply, and I don’t think it should be that hard of a concept to grasp. No one is claiming these things are unstoppable, just much harder to stop.
The dualistic thinking of "Russia vs. the U.S.", the little sidekick of the related what-aboutism that tends to spring up everytime Russia is criticized, is to me another give away I shouldn't be taking your musings seriously -- Russia has been behaving with animosity also towards European countries for decades, and their spying and disruption operations only reinforce the understanding they have little interest in co-existing peacefully with their neighbours like Ukraine -- their imperialistic atavism doesn't seem to let go of them. What's probably the real reason they consistently fail to reinvent themselves to a degree of prosperity they could deserve as nation, is their dragging investment in their glorious past from USSR times and their inability to let go of the pie-in-the-sky goal of getting back to be able to rub everyone's noses in how superior Russia is and how great it is to be worlds largest country of people under one state. They're infected with toxic patriotism and like a fungus that grows to control your brain, the parasitic virus has gotten hold of their collective psyche. It is certainly true their older generation has much to blame for control of their youth, and so the vicious cycle continues -- the young and hopeful are never given the chance to let go of the undying but treacherous ideal, and so round and round they go.
Russia is a Bank robber who has taken hostages. They have a rusty old knife, and the detonator to what they say is a giant bomb. They are trying to kill hostages one by one with the rusty knife. Even though the security guards have guns, no one is willing to take a shot for the fear they'll blow everyone up.
