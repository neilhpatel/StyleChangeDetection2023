How did you get a truck worth 25,000? Legally minors can own property. Gifts or inheritance given to a minor are the minors property. Parents can control whether a child gets an item (like taking away the car keys if you misbehave), but just taking it and converting it to their own use is illegal. Wages are different. Legally parents have rights to a child’s wages, in return for them being responsible for the child’s food, housing, etc. So, where the truck comes from makes a difference.
Their custodian does have a legal/fiduciary duty to act in LAOP's best interest and the withdrawal of funds from his account can be addressed through the courts, although having his mom's name on the title and bank account will complicate things and she may face no repercussions at all, unfortunately.
You haven't listed any. You only offer a legal mechanism available to OP to MOVE money which has EXACTLY the same mode of failure, and offers NO additional legal mechanism for securing that wealth from theft.
What are you going on about? This sub isn’t for general discussions of fixing the world, it’s for offering legal advice. LAOP sold the car to use the proceeds of that sale to buy another car.
