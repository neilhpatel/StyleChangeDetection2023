On the positive side: my wife (a high school history teacher) has had great success using excerpts from Charles Mann's _1491_ and _1493_ when teaching about the Americas. Aside from being a good writer and generally writing things that are defensible, Mann also does a great job of explaining where the historical claims come from (e.g., discussing the work of experts, research, contentious debates, etc.), which is a lot better than the popular books that sort of present the outcome as just something that is "known." It gives a nice sense of how this kind of research takes place, where the disagreements are, etc. It also makes for a nice comparison with some of the more mealy-mouthed textbooks out there... Mann has an amazing section in _1493_ on the Spanish treatment of natives for silver mining, and it made for a nice exercise to compare it with their textbook, which said the main problem was that the Spanish did not redistribute the earnings fairly (as opposed to, say, exposing them to so much mercury that it collected in pools in their grave sites).
Thanks for the assist! I’m curious, does environmental determinism account for germ warfare? Like “Because of their environment so and so are susceptible to the diseases brought by X”, or is that a different theory?
