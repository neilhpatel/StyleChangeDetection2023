As to the prospects of horse theft, especially if the guide is on foot...hiring a horse was NOT. CHEAP. Yes, it would be more, shall we say, financially expedient to steal a horse than to buy one. But in general, you'd have far better and less conspicuous ways of stealing horses than to ride away with one that was pretty well known, especially if you were also somewhat well known. (Of course, lords could also often get away with almost anything they wanted, but that's beyond the scope of the present question.).
The same desire for a smooth ride by plantation owners led to the development of gaited breeds like the Paso Fino in the Caribbean of the late 18th century (almost certainly descended from the Spanish jennet). The Tennessee Walker and Missouri Fox Trotter in the U.S., and the Peruvian Paso and Campeiro in South America were developed in the late 18th/early 19th century for the same reason. Plantation owners, cowboys, country doctors, and sheriffs -- all people who could realistically be in the saddle for the greater portion of a day -- all wanted gaited horses that could cover distance at a reasonable speed with minimal fatigue to the rider.
Sort of yeah but no. The posting trot is named after a person called a “postillion” (spelling varies by language), who drove a vehicle such as a large coach not from a seat on the vehicle itself, but from a position sitting on one of the horses.
That freed up another seat you could sell to a passenger, but the horses pulling a vehicle were usually driven at the gait which was most symmetrical and therefore jolted the vehicle least: the trot.
