The government that can’t keep a single thing secret basically ever, private companies with no reason to play along having satellites or observation material, hundreds of thousands of amateurs with telescopes powerful enough to see distant planets and basically every single person in the country famous for having “aliens visit” having a mobile hand held zoom enabled high quality camera and yet its all been constant visits and aliens for the last 60 years but there’s never any proof? Why is it always in the US or in this case Canada but actioned by the US rather than anywhere else.

Yes? You know that just because a balloon is deflated that it doesn't just fall straight down right? Wind is going to blow that shit off course hard. And once it deflates and falls low enough, radar isn't going to track shit. The jets fly too fast to really keep on a small ass target falling down.
