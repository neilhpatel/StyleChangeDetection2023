It is NOT illegal to drive a car that failed a safety inspection. You go to a station, and they failed it, but it's drivable. You have the slip saying it failed. You can still drive it, legally. You can NOT register it or renew the tags. This allows you to take it else where to get repaired or repair it yourself if you're so inclined. So again, legal to drive, just you won't be able to renew your tags.
It IS illegal to drive a car that doesn't pass inspection. If the vehicle is deemed unsafe and an accident occurs because of it, knowing that it is unsafe to drive, you can be held liable as well as the mechanic that passed it.
If it is the safety inspection that didn't pass, means it didn't pass the minimums deemed to make a car "safe" to drive, it can lead to an accident. For example, if one of your steering bits is faulty and your steering fails causing you to plow into a school bus and investigations finds that this was caught at one inspection station but passed at another without evidence of repair, not only do you get hit with liability, but the second inspection station can be hit as well.
That's mainly what I'm after. I have just heard this shop in particular is a little more lenient. If not more lenient then at least cheaper. Place I'm at now is in a richer part of town and I was told that price was a little crazy.
