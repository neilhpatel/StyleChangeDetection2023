Depending on where you are, revenge porn can come into play here. She's using a nude photo of you and displaying it to anyone and everyone. Screenshot everything on ig. Then contact the police in her state and yours. Let them know everything that has been going on.
As most people have said take legal action, look into getting a lawyer or maybe legal counsel especially from organizations used to dealing with (online) stalking, defamation and harassment to help figure out the most appropriate course of action according to the situation and what your girlfriend needs / wants.
Thank you for the response. She'll be contacting him in the morning. Anna has already texted him but believes that his phone is still in the possession of the wife. No response.
Please make sure to document, record and safe everything (whenever possible and legal) that has happened until this moment, however uncomfortable or small detail it may seem; because this may serve as evidence or at least context for police, lawyer etc.
She's overwhelmed. We're trying to figure out a game plan. I'm going to try and get ahold of (or help her get ahold of) an actual detective in either Missouri or Tennessee tomorrow. At this point she's just focused on filing a report and she's frustrated that neither police department is allowing her to do so.
She's just trying to file a police report at this point. Neither department is willing to file one without a report from the other. I never imagined that it would be so difficult to report something like this.
