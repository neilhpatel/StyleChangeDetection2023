One thing I would say is that the teacher is not correct in that they are getting much of the timeline incorrect. The Puritan "Great Migration" to the Massachusetts Bay Colony took place in the 1630s, much of it specifically caused by the elevation of William Laud to the Archbishropic of Canterbury in 1633, and his support for Charles' I religious reforms, which were seen as "High Church" (ie, too similar to Catholicism). This immigration totaled some 13,000 to 21,000 people and ended fairly abruptly in the early 1640s, with the opening of the Long Parliament and the political crisis resulting in the English Civil Wars. Anyway, these emigrants (many of whom returned to England during the Civil Wars) did not represent a majority of Puritans. They didn't even represent a majority of Puritans who emigrated, as about twice as many moved to Barbados in the Caribbean in this time period as those settling in Massachusetts Bay.
Yes, they did. He was actually lucky not to be executed. But he was very damaged by his ordeal, and lived only until 1660.
For example, loudly announcing he married a couple outside the established Congregational Church, bringing wheelbarrows into services, refusing to pay taxes for the church, occupying meeting houses, etc. Ended up spending many years in prison for his views. Was alledged to burn down a Congregational Church as well.
