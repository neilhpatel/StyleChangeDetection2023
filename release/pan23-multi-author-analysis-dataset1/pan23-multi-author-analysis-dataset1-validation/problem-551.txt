Whilst we deal with the fallout you get to leave smug comments like this. The majority of todays voting demographic didn’t vote to leave or vote conservatives in. That’s what happens when bitter old wretches vote against their own country because of bigotry and xenophobia. They won’t strike because they can’t leave their hospital beds. Not that they would want to. TLDR Think about the people dealing with this shit, the last thing we need is smarmy sweeping statements such as this.
The UK is still the second biggest economy in Europe and with predictions showing the backlash of Brexit to be mostly over by 2024 and the UK to start growing again, we would be of value to the EU, but with the tensions finally settling it is still too soon for both the EU and the UK, but by 2025 if we elect an actual government with some brains the EU will likely be open to start putting in place better trade deals with the UK and building that relationship up again what ultimately could lead to another UK vote to join the EU sometime in the next 10 to 25 years but of course things can change.
Polling is snake oil. Most respected polls from 2013 to the day before the referendum all pointed to ‘Remain’ wining out.
