The disappointing answer is there really isn't a way to guarantee payment. Winning a judgement codifies the debt as valid and gives you longer to try to collect, really. It does, however, give you additional mechanisms to try to force payment, but it's worth mention that nothing can make money that doesn't exist appear, and there are very few penalties a court can impose to force a debtor to pay a court-ordered judgement.
First of all, thank you for this. I live in New York I edited my post. I am so angry! I hate him for this. The amount is $2650. He has a nice house and wife and kids, a couple cars... Facebook shows a decent lifestyle, but maybe I shouldn’t even bother and just consider it a loss. His website says he’s licensed and insured but I can’t find where he’s licensed at all either to report him. I can’t find him on BBB. He did have good reviews on Google when I found him. I just don’t want him to do this to others either. I hate that most of what I’ve read is “it’s too much trouble/too expensive/can’t make him pay” meaning this jerk can just steal and steal and steal and not get in trouble, it makes no sense, he is a thief. He did no work on my house just lied about coming and didn’t come. People can go to jail for stealing, but not in this case, which just pisses me off. Sorry I’m just ranting now ugh.
If you tell us your location, we can give you more information, but generally speaking after you win, the court may require the defendant to answer a financial interrogatory, giving their bank information, list of real assets/property, employer information, and so on. Once this is submitted, it allows a prevailing plaintiff to pursue remedies such as seizing money in bank accounts or real property, getting an order to garnish wages (if employed, but it seems this is a self-employed person), or placing a lien on real property so that the debt must be satisfied before title can transfer and so on. Each of these steps requires additional court involvement to obtain the writ of seizure, garnishment, or lien, which unfortunately also means more time and money invested in chasing down the debt. These costs can be added to the judgement for the defendant to pay, and interest and other penalties can be included, but going back to the fact nothing makes money appear if it doesn't exist and the limits the court has to impose additional penalties (e.g. we do not have debtor's prisons in the US for people who don't pay debts,) -- it takes some careful consideration to decide how far you want to go in trying to force collection before it becomes throwing good money after bad. You will know the contractor's financial position way better than we can guess.
