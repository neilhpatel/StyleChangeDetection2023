Considering your question purely as 'what legal pretext/s might have been used to justify raiding gay bars and/or arresting and beating gay people?', the ones I can think of include:
The 1970s roll around, and activists like Cynthia Slater and Pat Califia start pushing for lesbian acceptance in the community, and before 1980 Dykes on Bikes and Sanois (a lesbian MC, and a lesbian, feminists BDSM community, respectively) enters the scene. At this point there are BDSM/Leather/Biker publications everywhere, the movement has a lot of crossover with gay rights, the AIDS epidemic, women's rights, motorcycle clubs, and fetishism, all sharing this one community in common.
Oh wow. That must have been quite an interesting rabbit hole! I love looking at photos of Castro and the east village/docks in nyc circa 1980. I do think that we are kinda back in the party type of lifestyle. At least where Iâ€™m from meth and sleeping around and partying all weekend is what a lot of guys are into. Kinda like my generation has forgotten what happened.
