Well thank you for answering another question I had in mind. Whether or not this redit group are actual lawyers and had the experience to help me with my inquiry.
Is it normal for lawyers to say no, with no explanation and with out seeing you. How hard would it have been to just tell me that there is no case. And if the gender roles were reversed do you think anything would have been done?
So what exactly do you call it when your employer calls you misogynistic solely based on your gender? When you haven't given them any indication for the comment. Well except disagreeing with a coworker about what is and isn't training. I would love to hear your response.
A hostile working environment refers to an employee being harassed or intimidated based on their membership in a protected class (such as race, sex, religious affiliation, etc).
No, it is not. Attorneys telling you they cannot help you means that there is either no money in pursuing a suit or no success, or both.
Really? You have $20k ready to slap down as a retainer, and can pay up to $100k to take the case to trial?
