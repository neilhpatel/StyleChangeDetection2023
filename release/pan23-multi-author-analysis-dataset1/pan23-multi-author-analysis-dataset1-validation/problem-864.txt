I wonder if there was ever an attempt to make a strategy game that is more historically accurate in terms of how technology works. The problem with the typical tech tree (think the various Civ games) is that first, it's exactly clear what's currently available to be researched and how long each of those will take; and second, all the long-term consequences are clear too. "Let's research gunpowder now so we can research artillery in time for when we want to start that war against the neighbors.".
The obvious example coming to mind is that by the year 2000 India had a nuclear weapons program and a space program, but also a substantial percentage of its population living below the poverty line, even more people without access to sewage systems, and even uncontacted(ish) hunter-gatherer communities.
Stellaris has a tech tree but you can't see it. When you want to research a new technology you are presented with a probabilistic selection of technologies you have unlocked via previous research. The probability of getting a certain option depends on a number of factors, ie previous research empire setup, the scientist assigned to the field etc. It is still not entirely what you imagined but at least there is no rushing along the tech tree as in other games.
