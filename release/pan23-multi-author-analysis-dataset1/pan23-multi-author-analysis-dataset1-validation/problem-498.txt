What is the origin of the "knight on a bridge" trope that was parodied, for example, in the Black Knight scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and in the meeting with Sir Didymus in Labyrinth? I assume this originated with a particular story (?).
The Chalcedonian definition therefore reads: "acknowledged in Two Natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably... the properties of each Nature being preserved, and (both) concurring into One Person and One Hypostasis".
I'd like to ask a question about Hero of Alexandria. Forget his steam toy: I'd just like to know when he lived. It seems to me that in the past he was believed to have lived in the first century BC, because Vitruvius wrote about a steam powered machine in De Architectura (iirc). Now I often read that Hero's floruit was in the first century AD, but sometimes I also find a vague I-III century AD. I know that some people of the ancient world whose biography is almost unknown to us are difficult to place chronologically, but I thought that someone could tell me what is the modern scholarly consensus on Hero's lifetime and what evidences make this collocation the most likely.
The main problem was that no one else did either. And both sides were quick to accuse the other of heresy more for political reasons than theological. And to complicate matters, the opposition to Nestorius at Ephesus was Cyril's theology which later led into monophysitism which was declared a heresy, though Cyril wasn't considered a heretic himself, just those who took his language too far.
However, it is important to recognise that this creed didn't exist at Ephesus (and wouldn't for another 20 years), and that it wasn't exactly Cyril's argument against Nestorius (though it was close). His argument was a sort of precursor to both monophysitism and dyophysitism, and had actually led to the Syrian church accusing Cyril of heresy while he accused Nestorius of heresy.
The distinction really was between how "Nestorianism" and what later became Chalcedonian dyophisitism spoke of the distinction between the two natures of Christ. Nestorius famously said that he could not speak of the divine creator having been a baby. For him there was a fundamental division within Christ. He had two natures and they were united, but still sometimes things happened either to, or because of, one nature and sometimes another.
