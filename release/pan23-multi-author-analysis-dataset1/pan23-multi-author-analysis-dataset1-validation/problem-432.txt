Traffic infractions don't normally have the formalities of a full trial. You are highly unlikely to get a formal opening and closing statement. The officer will be called to the stand, will tell the judge that he saw you do what you are claiming you didn't then you will get on the stand claim the cop either doesn't remember things correctly or that he is lying. The judge will then decide that the officer was telling the truth and find you guilty and order you to pay a fine plus court fees.
u/ops-name-checks-out u/bricker1492 Interesting. What are the general rules for cross examining an officer. I'm going to show that the officer didn't have a great view of my car and that what he saw was not my phone but my sun glasses. I'm also considering asking him to describe the colors of my phone on that day. If he had a good enough view to be able to differentiate my phone from my sun glasses he should be able to pick out the colors of my phone case. Thoughts?
It's worth mention that since the hearing is not like a trial you've seen on TV or in the movies generally, if you decide you want to put the court through the motions of one - which may well be your right -- the court is going to have an absolutely delightful time enjoying themselves dinging you on . You're going to want to know all of these rules, in addition to things like what is and is not admissible on top of things like what is and isn't actually an effective argument.
