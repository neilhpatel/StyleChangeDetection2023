long answer: the iriquois, the ojibwe, the eastern cree, the missipian cultures (just a conoe ride down the missisipi to the great lakes culture area) were all permanently settled cultures covering most of the eastern continent from the hudson bay, to the maritimes to florida and the gulf.
Completely correct. To add to your point, the Hopewell Interaction Sphere, commonly referred to as the Mound Builders, reached along the St. Lawrence River, into Upstate New York, Ontario and lower Quebec from 500BC to around 500AD. In the Eastern Great Lakes area were four distinct cultures reminiscent of Hopewell influence (New York Hopewell, Couture Complex, Saugeen Complex, & Point Peninsula Complex) who left behind ample evidence of their settlements through both Burial and Effigy Mounds, such as those along those along the Trent Valley/Rice Lake in Ontario, or the few mound enclosures found around South Ontario, slightly similar in shape but not so much in size to mound enclosures throughout Ohio (Chillicothe specifically). Archaeologists aren't exactly positive on what lead to the cultural changes throughout the area that left us with the Iroquoian peoples, but some of these nations, specifically the Wendat/Huron, retained some mortuary practices similar to the Hopewell before them, in the form of Ossuary burials topped with earthen mounds. Some well known Ancient Structures throughout the Eastern Great Lakes area are the Rice Lake Serpent Mounds (Ontario), Thunderbird Mound (Ontario), Perch Lake Mounds (New York), Prince Edward County Mounds (Ontario) and many many more if you know where to look. Also, in 1670, Sulpician Missionaries Dollier and Galline wrote during their expedition throughout the great lakes, just southwest of Detroit, "At the end of six leagues we discovered a place that is very remarkable, and held in great veneration by all the Indians of these countries, because of a stone idol that nature has formed there. To it they say they owe their good luck in sailing on Lake Erie, when they cross it without accident, and they propitiate it by sacrifices, presents of skins, provisions, etc., when they wish to embark on it. The place was full of camps of those who had come to pay their homage to this stone, which had no other resemblance to the figure of a man than what the imagination was pleased to give it. However, it was all painted, and a sort of face had been formed for it with vermillion. I leave you to imagine whether we avenged upon this idol, which the Iroquois had strongly recommended us to honor, the loss of our chapel. We attributed to it even the dearth of provisions from which we had hitherto suffered. In short, there was nobody whose hatred it had not incurred. I consecrated one of my axes to break this god of stone, and then having yoked our canoes together we carried the largest pieces to the middle of the river, and threw all the rest also into the water, in order that it might never be heard of again. God rewarded us immediately for this good action, for we killed a roebuck and a bear that very day".
