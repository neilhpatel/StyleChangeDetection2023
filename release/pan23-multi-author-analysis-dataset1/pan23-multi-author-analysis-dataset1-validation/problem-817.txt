Next "After this point, nobody really knows what happened with certainty." This is straightforwardly untrue. The Catholic church, with the archbishopric at Niðarós (modern Trondheim) was in charge of the bishopric of Greenland, at Garðar, with the first attested one in both Norwegian and Icelandic annals being in 1112. According to many of those annals, in 1121 the current bishop, Eirikr, set off on a journey to Vinland He appears to have died at sea, though, since in 1124 a new bishop of Greenland, Arnaldr, was appointed. We continue to get regular accounts of Greenland, and even some literary production attributed to the islanders most significantly, in the 1360s we get the text Grænlandslýsing Ívar Bárðarsonar, a description of Greenland told to the author by a steward of the bishopric of Greenland. So, our prim.
"However, the settlement endured into the 15th century, before quietly and peacefully being abandoned.".
So, I'm doing some extrapolation from a bunch of fairly distant evidence, as you can see, but there is a pattern of dehumanizing the ""uncivilized"" people the Norse interacted with, which justifies unprovoked violence, and I don't see a reason why, in the absence of reliable evidence to the contrary, that this pattern should have been different in Norse Greenland.
Initial disclaimer: Saying that obviously does not mean that violence was the norm, or the exclusive ability of the Norse; the archaeological evidence indicates that peaceful interactions were more common than not. Additionally, Thule-Norse relations are fairly dramatically understudied in the field, so this inevitably requires a fair bit of speculation, but looking at how Norse literature portrays and interacts with various marginalized groups sheds some light on the most likely potential.
Why is that? What sources lead you to suspect that? On its face without further elaboration it seems to be part of a "noble savage/wicked invader" narrative but I assume it's more well founded than that.
