On the practicality side of things, consider that in the 1500's there was no indoor plumbing. It seems like an obvious statement but when you need to get your water from either a nearby above ground water source or a well, having it immediately at hand in your home would be super convenient. I have to admit here that it's been years since I've seen Seven Samurai and I don't recall the feature you're mentioning, so I'm kind of presuming off of what I know about traditional home design, but was the creek in the kitchen or the living space? Generally homes were built up off the ground except for some spaces like the kitchen which would be on the ground with a dirt floor. Having a creek pass through here would be simple and useful.
Except the village in the Seven Samurai was , Akira Kurosawa is not known for being historically accurate (peasants didn't eat white rice at the time and the samurai focus too much on sword skills for example, and considering a character accurately and effectively shot a bow in heavy rain, apparently realism wasn't a huge priority either), and if anything farmhouses were usually built entirely on leveled, slightly-elevated foundation platform to keep out rain water. The thatched roof of the farmhouses are also not nearly thick enough or at steep-enough angle, especially for an area that demonstrably gets heavy rain. Understandable for a movie set that doesn't need to last, not a historical or reconstructed farmhouse or museum town.
