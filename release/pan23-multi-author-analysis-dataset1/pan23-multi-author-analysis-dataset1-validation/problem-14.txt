The CTA was suspended at the outbreak of war in 1939 (Ireland was neutral in WW2, although they did enter into war planning scenarios with the UK for a joint defence in the circumstance of a German invasion of Ireland). It is interesting to note that even in this case the UK judged it impossible to establish a border between the RoI and NI; border checks were instead implemented between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain.
In short, there has never been a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland; there has, as recently as 1952, been a hard border between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain.
Until 1922 the United Kingdom was the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and as such there was no border.
In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom. The UK government judged that it was impractical to patrol a 300 mile long land border (something which they had little experience with, given Britain shares no other land borders) and proposed to their Irish counterparts that they continue with the status quo. In order for this to be practical, both countries would have to agree to enforce each other's immigration policies; agreement on this was reached in early 1923 and relevant legislation was passed in both countries to this effect in 1925.
Thank you! I can see how there's an answer of "there was and there wasn't" to the question of a hard border.
