It may be that a temporary order will not be necessary in your situation. Temporary orders are often issued when, for whatever reason, it is going to take some time for the court to issue a final order. A divorce is a good example as it often takes over a year for the final order and divorce to be issued. If your lawyer knows that no matter what, the court will be issuing a custodial order at your court date, a temporary order will not be necessary. But if you're concerned your ex may draw out the process in an attempt to withhold the child from you for as long as possible, you should know that the court does have ways of addressing this.
Talk to your lawyer about requesting a temporary custody order at the earliest opportunity to restore your access to the child while this matter is being litigated.
This makes sense. My lawyer must know that a decision will be made on the court date, my concern is like you mentioned above, my ex will try anything and everything to delay the process. I think she is trying to get me to lose my temper to use it against me? Her actions make no sense when considering the best interest of our daughter.
