"no fuckin way. 1) you couldn't do that in that way today AND. 2) you were 5 years younger than I am now when you did that?".
While I'm skeptical these protests are wise, there are no universal rules to evaluate protest legitimacy by and they must, I think, be rationally justified on a greater good argument (somewhat like acceptable levels of casualties of war and wrongful imprisonment). Given human nature, some protests may have substantial numbers of people who honesty misunderstood the greater good as well as self-interested opportunists and branding an entire group is--for the greater good, I think--unwise.
No. But some may vote against climate initiative just to spite the protestors. Or sway some in a local election. There are still independents, you know.
Seriously. Life has felt dramatically different in that time span, could just be my age and really kinda realizing things as an adult, I guess. But even beyond that it definitely feels fucky as hell. I see and hear about what my parents did, and think.
