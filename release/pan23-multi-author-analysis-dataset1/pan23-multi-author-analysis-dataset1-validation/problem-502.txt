I’m not sure that the owner has any idea what he is talking about. The Americans with Disabilities Act and Occupational Safety and Health Act don’t really have anything to do with one another. I have never heard of a reasonable accommodation under the ADA somehow triggering a company to need company wide updated safety protocols. I suppose if your reasonable accommodation happened to somehow alert the company that its safety protocols were inadequate as a whole then it might suggest that they need to change what they are doing, but I don’t see how that would apply here. Furthermore, directly to this point, OSHA has basically said that if an employee voluntarily chooses to wear a respirator where it is not required the company has no obligations (see the OSHA link at the bottom of this post).
Thank you so much. I've been trying to find more specific interpretations for the situation, but thanks to the pandemic, most mask-based questions are asking how to get out of them instead of into them.
