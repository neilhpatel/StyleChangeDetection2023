Oof thanks for linking this post, so guess I won't start with Diamond. As someone who had an absolutely horrible education in history it's really hard to know where to start when looking for "accessible" books that provide good overviews, when I don't really have the knowledge to critically analyze anything I come across. So I appreciate the steering help!
I would also posit that several of the most colorful and interesting areas of historical study are, in my experience, those which seem the most mundane, possibly in part because the perceived boringness is due to a lack of information that can be quickly and dramatically remedied. For example, the history of science is often viewed by the uninitiated as a drab and tedious affair, but it may be one of the most common topics that I see surprising people when it draws them in. Put another way: it's obviously fun to learn about topics that already interest you, but consider topics that you know little about because you may find quality reading on them to be very illuminating. /2c.
For instance: IF the European conquest of the Americas was swift, decisive, and total, THEN we can attribute modern global equality to differences that existed before that conquest that enabled it to be swift, decisive, and total. But European colonization occurred over centuries of brutal genocide and was constantly on the verge of failure; it depended more on the particularities of geopolitics at the very moment contact than on any major societal difference. But for the general public, 1492 is the turning point for the Americas, the exact moment history began and the continents' story became about Europeans, not their indigenous peoples. Rewriting this misconception is a massive process beyond the constraints of a single book review. And so the casual reader is left with a choice: internally consistent If-Then statement that jives with their accepted worldview, or a lenhy rebuttal of something that's always "just made sense" that doesn't address the consistency of the If-Then statement at all. One of those is a lot more appealing.
Specific to How Humans Evolved, the topic is a step outside of history and I can't say that I'm familiar with what's what in evolutionary biology, physical anthropology, primatology and so on. You might find and check their journals for more.
