Nah fam. You misunderstand what greed is. Corporations aren't greedy, they just play the game we made for them efficiently. That's different from greed.
Which was the same time they started taking our tech overseas and into non developed country’s paying for child labor to get the most profits sheltering there earning and not putting back into America it’s never enough for these corporate vampires like the shit Musk said when he demanded long hard hours if they want to remain yet took the perks away lol just a glimpse of a Republican.
I agree. They destroyed ecosystems, wildlife, natural areas, caused the death of so much, and yet they fought that Valdez spill for years before a paltry payout. I have not bought ExxonMobil petrol since the 90's because of their behavior and not accepting blame and reparations. That's my minor protest and I am proud of it.
These fucking companies pay no tax, get massive subsidies to offset infrastructure, lobby against clean competitors to cement their destruction of the planet, are responsible for massive atmospheric, biodiversity and heritage damage.
These fucking companies warp our laws, ruin our kids future, manipulate our media, pay off our politicians and wal away with earning everything and contributing nothing.
Worse when you realise that they have used their economic clout and interests in media to lobby, bully, pay off and intimidate politicians to delay the renewable transitions.
