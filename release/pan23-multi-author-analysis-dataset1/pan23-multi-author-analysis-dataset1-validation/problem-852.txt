I’m guessing that’s the English - Composition (writing) requirement. And it looks like she also needs the PE requirement.
Thank you for explaining everything clearly and simple(I'm not that smart myself but I try to be proper and admire people who write properly and cleanly), I am aware she can't graduate without this but my whole concern and what's really frustrating is that when she told the guy who handles online school for our school over and over again, he would just keep saying she has everything she needs but now he's saying she needed to have more classes and she was right. I hate to be that guy but he shouldn't be allowed to controll the online students schedules and courses if he is "accidentally" not giving students their whole required courses then doesn't fix the mistake when pointed out at him multiple times.
What state are you in? What courses is she missing? Sometimes schools can have different requirements than the state. In that case, she might still be able to get a diploma from the state. Also sometimes if the requirements for the state changed during your enrollment, you can be eligible under the previous requirements. It would depend on the state and missing courses, however. Because not all states allow public high schools to instate different requirements or new requirements for existing students and, of the ones that do, many still have certain requirements you can’t get past (4 years of english/writing classes, for instance).
Gotcha! I asked because it seems all other responses are assuming this is happening in a post-secondary degree program, where the steps for addressing this issue would be very different.
