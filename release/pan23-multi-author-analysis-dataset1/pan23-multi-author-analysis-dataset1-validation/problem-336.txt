As I understand it, you have two main questions. The first, and most important, is "Did commoners care about politics or was it only a princes' affair ?" I purposely enlarged it to commoners rather than peasantry to include cities inhabitants. The second, related, is : "Why the hell would peasant fight in nobles' armies and stand their ground ?". I hope I understood it correctly, correct me if I'm wrong !
This is not to say that they were necessarily used well or formed as important a part of the royal armies in the 14th and 15th centuries as they did in the 12th and 13th centuries, because in spite of some initial experimentation with them at Morlaix and Cr√©cy they rapidly lost relevance to pitched battles, but they were an important part of the later "defence in depth" strategy, forming the majority of garrisons in fortified towns and the like.
Hello ! It's a vast question but I'll try to answer on some aspects and although it is not my chief specialty, I'll try to give you some elements.
