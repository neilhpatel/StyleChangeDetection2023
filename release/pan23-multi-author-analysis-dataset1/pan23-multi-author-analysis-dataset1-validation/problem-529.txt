Well, it's legal for an employer to not pay overtime if they can somehow prevent employees from WORKING the overtime. (Like scheduling them for 35 hours, so even if they work up to 5 hours extra, it doesn't have to be paid at 1.5x.) But if an employee somehow does work 40.25 hours or more, despite the employer's best efforts, the employer can discipline them, up to and including firing them, for going against company policy, but they still have to pay the 1.5x for the time over 40 hours.
Your reply WAS incorrect, because you said employers can offer comp time if they want and only have to pay for hours worked, but never specific that for non-exempt employees, hours past 40 in a week MUST be paid at 1.5x their regular wage. That's what I was clarifying for OP, since that seems pretty relevant to their question. Your response strongly implies that time CAN be banked instead of being paid out, and it cannot. (Employers can offer extra vacation time for any reason they want, but MUST pay 1.5x for OT regardless.).
Huh. I wasn't aware that there were states with more lax laws. According to the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry (), the federal law only kicks in under certain circumstances, which they list. If your retailer exists in multiple states, that might trigger it. I would try to contact the federal FLSB and/or the Minnesota folks to get to the bottom of it. Usually, whichever law is more strict overrides, but their website makes it seem like that's not necessarily the case.
Yes, absolutely. "Interstate commerce" is defined broadly. Even something as trivial as a hot dog stand can be considered interstate commerce if some of the ingredients in their food were produced out of the state (). Reselling products which were obtained from another state, or selling products to customers outside the state, are _unquestionably_ interstate commerce.
