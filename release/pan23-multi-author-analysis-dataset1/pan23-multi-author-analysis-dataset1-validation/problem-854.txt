FDR's long time physician VADM Ross McIntire gets deservedly blamed an awful lot for keeping the lid on the disaster that was FDR's health in 1944 and 1945, but there's plenty of evidence that the patient himself both didn't want to know and didn't want anyone else to know as well. As FDR began deteriorating, McIntire brought in several specialists, including in March 1944 when cardiologist Howard Bruenn was just appalled with the results of his examination. Despite the dreadful misunderstanding of hypertension during that era where it was considered normal for blood pressure to rise with age (which allowed for one 170/88 reading of FDR's to be considered acceptable rather than what it'd indicate today, which would likely be an intervention involving hospitalization), he peaked at 240/130, which was terrifying even to physicians of the time.
Very interesting, thank you for the insight. If I could ask for a brief clarification, when you say that the later celiac disease diagnosis was botched, do you mean that the diagnosis of celiac disease itself was inaccurate, or that that diagnosis might well have been the proper one, and the earlier diagnoses of things like cancer, and the (unnecessary?) operations resulting from those diagnoses, were the element that was botched?
His last big trip was getting called back by Truman to assuage Stalin after the former had ripped into Molotov about the Soviet Union thoroughly ignoring the Yalta agreements on Poland - "I've never been spoken to like that in my life" Truman: "Well you wouldn't get spoken to like that if you kept to your agreements" Truman very shortly after to former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Joseph Davies (edit: as recounted by Chip Bohlen): "I gave him the one-two right to the jaw!" (pause) "I did right, didn't I?" - shortly after taking office, and he stuck around to advise Truman as best he could through his death in 1946.
That left one Harry S Truman. He was electable as a moderate who was popular among Southerners and at least then was acceptable to labor and not anathema to liberals. Unlike in 1940, by 1944 his work and ethics displayed on the Truman Committee (Marshall had told him in a rare moment of praise that it was worth a couple of divisions) was respected by even Republicans - despite some grumbling outside Capitol Hill that he was still a failed haberdasher and farmer and came out of the Pendergast machine. And last but not least, even without the organization of his now-jailed patron or the national party in 1940, he had pulled off unlikely odds to keep his Senate seat and was a hell of a campaigner.
