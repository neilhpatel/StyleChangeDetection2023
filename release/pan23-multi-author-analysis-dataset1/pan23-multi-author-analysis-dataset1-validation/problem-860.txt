Not your attorney and your best course of action is to consult with an employment law attorney licensed in your state. However, it is important for you to know that California law maintains a presumption of "at will" employment, meaning that employees can generally be fired for any reason or no reason, as long as it isn't because of a protected characteristic [race, sex, religion, sexual orientation, etc.].
That said, depending when you are due with your child, and how many hours you've worked, you may be able to collect disability closer to your due date, and/or utilize CFRA pr other company (if any) family leave benefits. So it may be in your interest to work in-person for a while to at least ensure you've got income still once the baby is born. But there are minimum hour and other specific requirements in order to qualify for different types of leave. And if you use employer-sponsored health insurance, you have to return to work for at least a short time or else risk being forced to pay back any benefits they paid into during your leave. Also many companies require that you use any accrued vacation and sick time at the start of your paid leave, whatever type you end up using, if any.
