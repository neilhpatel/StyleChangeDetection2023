There is no evidence that Rāmā was a historical person, though there is little evidence to counter that either. The claims made above are, frankly, absurd. I see not a single thing that can be called completely correct. It is full of half truths and outright fabrications. I'm going to debunk each claim in turn:
General similarities prove nothing other than the universality of human experience and proximate causes are preferred over more exotic explanations. For instance, the existence of a geoglyph in a region known to have geoglyphs, and the particular glyph appearing to be consistent with iconography of the region, should suggest a local creation for the geoglyph. The hypothesis of the geoglyph being created by an outside entity is an extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary evidence, not vague eyebrow waggling in the direction of several millenia of unrelated iconography.
1. The Lion man is a spectacular statue, one of the first and finest examples of figurative art in the world, but beyond that we know next to nothing. Is it male or female? Both? Neither? Is it a God, a Spirit, a Human with a mask? We don't know. What we do know is that Viṣṇu as a concept did not exist yet, especially the Daśāvatāra Narasiṃha, which we can date to the Gupta period or slightly before during the composition of the Puraṇas. Hinduism, or more properly the cults that now make up Hinduism are descended from Vedic religion, itself descended from Proto-Indo-European religion. The PIE culture began to develop some 8,000 years ago in the Pontic Steppe before splitting off into various descendants who we now recognize. The Indo-Aryans mad their way to India sometime in the 15th or 16th century BCE and spread until they were the dominant culture in North India, bringing their religion along with them. Viṣṇu appears in the later mandalas of the Ṛgveda and has a very different role from the godhead cult that would develop around the 6th or 5th century BCE. As such, we can probably call this bunk.
It's actually simple connection. "Vishnu" from etymology point of view, is made of "vish" and "anu".."vish" in Vedic Sanskrit meant 'water' and "anu" means particle or droplets. "Vishnu" interprets as water droplet or rain drops. In Vedic reference, Vishnu is also called upendra, assistant of Indra.. When Indra is happy, he sends Vishnu to earth (vasundhra). Vishnu permeates in every part of vasundhra.
Obviously this is just a general refutation on only one of the bullet points you have put forth, but it is consistent with most debunkings of pseudohistory in that the implied connections between cultures evaporate at even the most cursory glance, and that debunking a single sentence requires paragraphs of explanation. As Mark Twain said, "a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting its shoes on." Also, Mark Twain never said that, but debunking the origin of that quote would , although the basic truth of the aphorism remains. It is very easy to cherry pick from thousands of years of visual and written works in order to support a pre-ordained conclusion. Less easy is actually learning the history and iconography of a particular culture in order to understand it on its own merits, as opposed to relying on hyper-diffusionist fairy tales.
3. The word "Egypt" comes from Greek Αἴγυπτος or Aigyptos which according to the Oxford English-Greek dictionary comes from Hut-ka-ptah which was old Egyptian for the "House of the Body of Ptah" or "Kingdom of Ptah." The Egyptian name for Egypt was Kemet. So that's one down. Part 2 of this is even more bizarre and an Egyptologist could tackle this better but let me put it this way, Hinduism never spread to Egypt, the Egyptians practiced an eclectic mix of religions throughout their very long history and by the Roman era had become a cosmopolitan place of Hellenistic, Egyptian, Gnostic, Persian, and Christian Religions, with Coptic Orthodox dominating by the End of Roman Rule and continuing to be the dominant, but not ruling, religion until the end of the 1st Millennium CE. This is not to say that the Egyptians were completely unaware of Hinduism, South Indian traders occasionally made there way there, but they didn't stick around.
Yes, definitely complicated and fluid. Even Indra and Varuna, while clearly distinct and even oppositional figures, have a lot of overlap in their core functions, in a complementary dynamic with Indra as the "prime mover" and "transgressor of boundaries" and Varuna as the "sustainer" and "binder of transgressors".
5. I'm not sure what to even say about this one other than no. The settlers of America had been more or less cut off from Asia for about 10,000 years by that point and the idea of an "aryan race" is so outdated and steeped in racism that it is pretty offensive. Anthropologists now have completely rejected the idea of race as a biological reality. If we are talking from an ethnolinguistic perspective the answer is still no, because the major point of contact between the Americas and Afro-Eurasia had been severed for well over a thousand years before the PIE language or mythology is known to have existed, let alone what we would think of as "Indian." We can find similar gods just about everywhere if we look hard enough. This process is similar to the psychological process of apophenia, or seeing patterns where there is randomness. In anthropological terms, we are projecting our preconceived notions of what a culture and religion should have onto the culture and religion without considering the inside perspective on it and blocking out the counter evidence.
Now, Indra is rain god, and Varun is water god. That's a direct connection with rain. When Vishnu doesn't come, "garuda" (vulture) comes. That's a drought.
Again, I mean no disrespect and I accept that I may be wrong, but from the perspective of modern historians, the Vaiṣṇava interpretation of the Vedas as a form of monistic Viṣṇu worship is not correct. This doesn't, however, mean that it is wrong to interpret them that way if you so choose.
