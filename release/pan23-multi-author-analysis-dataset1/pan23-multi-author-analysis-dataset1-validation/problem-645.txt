Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we're letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as 'Why didn't X do Y' relatively often don't get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, 'why didn't X do Y' questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It's worth remembering that people in the past couldn't see into the future, and they generally didn't have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn't necessarily look that way at the time.
Absolutely. That's the nice thing about the Constitutional Amendment process. The U.S. can pass any law it wants through that process. It can overturn other portions of the Constitution (see: the 17th Amendment) and it can overturn previous amendments (see: the 21st Amendment). If a state so desired, and could get 2/3 of both houses of Congress, and 3/4 of the statehouses to agree to pass an amendment saying, "State X wants out of the Constitution, to become its own independent country," then a state certainly could secede.
In other words, "at-will" secession is illegal because, once the states had ratified the Constitution, they had pledged themselves to uphold it, and could not exit it except through ordinary Constitutional means (e.g., Constitutional amendment). The right to secede without going through a Constitutional process, says Madison, is just "another name...for revolution".
