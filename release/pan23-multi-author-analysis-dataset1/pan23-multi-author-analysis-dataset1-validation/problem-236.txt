If I can set up a bank account, apply for a mortgage, make every payment, set up an account and trade stocks, register my car, pay all taxes, manage retirement accounts, and access my medical record - all online and regulated by agencies that can throw you in the pokey for misuse, i think in 2023, Americans are capable of creating a secure way to vote online.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Abbott is such a clown. Has to make it out like it was done on purpose, when it was probably an innocent mistake. Hey, Abbott...maybe let Texas elections join the modern era in terms of vote by mail and early voting and you wouldn't have had these issues. And after a third consecutive year of blackouts, I don't think you want to give voters a chance to show the Republicans how they are feeling.
