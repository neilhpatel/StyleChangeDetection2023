And you think a bunch of religious zealots and extremists who can barely read and write, believe that the only education you should receive is from the Quran, are anti women and intellectualism, promote pedophilia, child-rape, and child marriage, are people who are trustworthy enough to carry on a long-term resource contract with a country that actively maintains reeducation camps of it's own population it then uses as slave labor, actively pushes for more surveillance and authoritarianism of it's own people, and even maintains secret police stations abroad it uses to kidnap dissidents and ship them back home for prison is going to have absolutely no issues and they are all going to live and work together happily ever after?
