The Sasanian empire extended its dominion into the Indian subcontinent, to around the port city of Deb, near modern , which you'll recognize is right next to the Indus, a veritable breadbasket and natural geographic barrier. A Greek list of trade ports from around the 1st century AD mentions a city referred to as _Barbarikon_ in this area, noting that control of the area was fought over by "Parthian princes". The inability of the Arsacids to keep this area under solid central control, and eventually allowing it to be conquered by the , is often brought up as a key difference between them and the Sasanians.
For much of Sasanian dominion, these fertile territories were instead able to sustain the mighty (which, as you can see, also didn't much conquer the southern half of India). Indian sources note that the Guptas clashed with Persian forces, and these would probably have served local Indo-Sasanian vassal kings, rather than the King of Kings in the west. But if we consider the prospect of Sasanian expansion into the plains in the 4th or early 5th centuries (before the temporary loss of _Kushanshahr_ to the Hephthalites who later threatened the Gupta as well as the Sasanians), by, for instance, a massive invasion launched by navy from the Indus mouth, we have to consider what they would actually have to gain and how they would be able to dominate the region of the Gupta.
Can I ask a follow up question? Weren't the Islamic sultanates of Delhi highly Persianized? And the Mughals were Turkic-Mongol who spoke Persian as well?
