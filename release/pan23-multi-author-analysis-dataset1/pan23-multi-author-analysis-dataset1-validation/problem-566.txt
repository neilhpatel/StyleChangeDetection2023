I am sure that intelligence on Russia has always been a priority. They seem to have come out strong so far in anticipating and out maneuvering from an intelligence standpoint. So I am sure they are actually that clever.
So they would need a duplicate, even larger, support train of personnel, space, moving equipment, specialized parts, dedicated to only abrams tanks and incompatible with what they already have. That is a lot for any country to handle, their mechanics can't just go oh yea, bring it into the shop I'll fix it, they need a whole different shop, different tools, different knowledge base, different supplier, and be equally near the front(as an IT guy I have tons of spare misc parts of windows PC's, but put an Apple in front of me and GL, I generally have an idea of what everything is but I have no spares, don't know most likely failure parts, nor do I have any proprietary tools to do anything with it).
This is more about crippling a long time foe and also setting a precedent. NATO won’t just sit around appeasing dictators and authoritarian regimes. This is a symbolic gesture to China.
I read in the Black Swan that the when Taleb (risk assessment guy who made big money during the 87 crash and is at least perceived as a bit of a finance guru) gave a presentation to military experts on his perceptions of risk he said they were by far the best under standers of risk he had come across.
Tanks going is one thing. You won’t hear about the CIA and spec ops that are already in Ukraine on the ground or the immense amount of intelligence and satellite ops that the US is providing to Ukraine.
