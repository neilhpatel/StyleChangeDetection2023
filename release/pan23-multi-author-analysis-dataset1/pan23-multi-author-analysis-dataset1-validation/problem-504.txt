It’s true! I took out about $20,000 in student loans 12 years ago. During that time, I made all my payments of something like $200 a month, except for when I lost my job during the pandemic. Even then, I paid on the loan. There is still $13,000 left on my loan and I just recently paid off all the interest. I’m 37.
