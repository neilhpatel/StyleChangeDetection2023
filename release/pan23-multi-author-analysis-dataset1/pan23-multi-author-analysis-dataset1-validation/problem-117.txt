Pretty much we had to rearrange my whole house because one guy didn’t want to share a bed… I was nice. Fml.
An alternative to advance notice followed by an eviction is to offer them something of value (generally, a gigantic pile of cash or whatever) to leave of their own accord, payable only once they and all their stuff are fully moved out and they're standing outside your front door handing the keys back.
If you want them gone, I would recommend you go the purely legal route with either a cash-for-keys arrangement, or proper, advance notice to vacate followed by an eviction.
They may be your tenants at this point, meaning they'd be entitled to advance notice (commonly 30 days, but highly location-dependent) to vacate from you followed by a formal eviction proceeding in court if they refuse to leave after that amount of time.
Everything you mentioned. Already done. I explained it all to my landlord and he said he understands but he isn’t getting involved and wants me to deal with it (or I’ll be in breach) I understood. Nice guy but he is stern.
