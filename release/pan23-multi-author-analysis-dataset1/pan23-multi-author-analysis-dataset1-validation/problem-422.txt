As you stated, in the Byzantine Chronicles, the Venetians are awarded specific privileges which in my opinion are a huge turning point in not only Byzantine history, but history in general. The Normans who were in this time ruling Southern Italy, defeated the Byzantines and conquered Durres/Durazzo/Dyrrachium which was a very important city for a couple of reasons. The geography is what gave it importance; first of all, as the Ottomans will mention much later in history, it is important as a ‘bridge’ between Constantinople to Rome, secondly, it had control of very important trade routes on land and sea. This worried the Venetians in particular which stood to lose a lot and they agreed to fight the Normans and defeated them in naval combat which the Normans were poor at (they were great on land, however). The Normans will attempt to launch a land battle but an uprising in Southern Italy and the fact that the Byzantine Emperor was sponsoring the Holy Roman Emperor in his dispute with the pope forced the Normans to retreat. The Venetians were granted tax free trading in the Byzantine Empire and control of important coastal lands. This granted the Venetians a monopoly in the region which would catapult them into wealth. Was this a dumb decision by Alexios? I leave that to the reader.
"Likewise the Emperor has conceded to us churches, priests, and baptism according to our custom in Constantinople and in other parts of his empire; these churches, priests, and baptism are exempt from Imperial authority...".
Beautiful. I appreciate your contribution as I'm sure OP does. As I mentioned in my post, I could stand to learn more about the religious situation and I will definitely look into your sources.
