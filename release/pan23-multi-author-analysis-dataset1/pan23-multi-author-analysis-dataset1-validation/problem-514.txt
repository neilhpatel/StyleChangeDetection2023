Great question, I’m looking forward to the other responses that I’m confident are in the works! I’ll talk a little about what I know, the survival of the Roman Empire through what is often referred to as the ‘Third Century Crisis’. There is ongoing debate on what caused the Crisis and what were the actual serious afflictions that weakened the Empire. Some historians downplay the severity of the period, and others point out that it would be more correct to refer to the period as the ‘Crises’, as from 235 CE the Empire faced civil war, foreign invasion, economic crisis, disease, banditry, climate change, and more.
8 years later, Nobunaga would finish what the Imagawa had started. In 1568, he marched to Kyoto and forced the Yamato Matsunaga clan to surrender the capital to him. In 1573, Nobunaga officially ended the Ashikaga shogunate. The nation was still heavily fractured and Nobunaga would spend the ensuing years up until 1582 crushing other Daimyo and forcing prefectures to submit.
In 1582, Nobunaga was betrayed by his own general Akechi Mitsuhide in what's known as the Honno-Ji incident and Nobunaga was assassinated. A loyal retainer named Toyotomi Hideyoshi became the second of the three leaders when he avenged Nobunaga and killed Mitsuhide. Hideyoshi was now the preeminent leader and the heir apparent to Nobunaga's growing power. In 1590 Hideyoshi accomplished the goal of unifying Japan for the first time since 1467 when he defeated the Hojo clan. All seemed well, until he decided Japan was not enough and launched a series of ill-advised invasions of Korea. The Korean invasions went poorly and Hideyoshi's prestige fell. He died in 1598.
The next division of the empire between Constantine, Maxentius and Licinius actually looked rather similar to the one between Octavian, Lepidus and Anthony. As in: it civil war followed by armed peace followed by more civil war until Constantine ruled surpreme. Only now with an added switch to favouring Christianity.
Combining with the other afflictions listed above, the outlook seemed particularly dire when in 260 emperor Valerian was captured after a losing battle and imprisoned by the Persians, and the provinces of Gaul, Britain, and Hispania broke away from central Roman control and formed what we now call the Gallic Empire (they continued to call themselves the Roman Empire, but historians love to assign new names to things). Valerian’s son, Gallienus, continued to face civil war and foreign invasion across the Danube River, allowing the Persians to launching devastating attacks and seize Rome’s eastern territories. This led to the city of Palmyra, previously a Roman ally, forming its own increasingly independent kingdom in the Levant and surrounding areas from 267 onwards. I think it is pretty safe to say that not only was the Empire in serious decline at this point in time, but it had catastrophically fragmented. But, as they say, the night is darkest before the dawn….
