You and your neighbours can keep contacting your Councilman, make a lot or noise about the issue and hope the city will disallow the kennel permit.
Appreciate the suggestion but unfortunately not applicable here. We do have issues with runoff - she maintains a giant garden and often runs her soaker hoses for hours at a time, leading to standing water on our property and water coming into our basement. I have not pursued this because the water getting in around the foundation is our problem, as I understand it.
Zoning infractions should be reported to Code Enforcement or Community Development/Planning not necessarily Animal Control. Just as is there was an unlicensed Mechanic doing business out of their garage, it doesn’t matter what business they are in if they properly zoned (or have a variance) then the probably don’t have a business license either.
Thanks. That's the stage I'm at now. It was delegated to a staffer and all I know is that she has responded to my initial concerns via email and has chimed in on a follow-up email that I sent to the animal control contact. Basically saying "we'd like to see if we can help resolve this".
