The reason we don't hear more about it is that it hasn't been studied as much. In contrast to the Aztecs, our historical sources on the P'urépecha are much thinner. The main historical source, the Relacion de Michoacán, is pretty much all there is on the pre-Columbian history. There are few minor sources, like the Lienzo de Jicalán or La Memoria de Don Melchor Caltzin, but these discuss specific, isolated events. They don't provide the overview narrative history that we need to flesh in lots of the details. While there are a few colonial era sources, like the Relaciones Geograficas, there isn't really anything comparable to the numerous Spanish chroniclers and native historians that we have for the Aztecs. This is largely due to the fact that the Aztecs provided a stiff resistance to the Spanish, and their state became the backbone of the Spanish colonial administration after the conquest. The P'urépecha, by contrast, surrendered without fighting because they were dealing with the smallpox outbreak and a coup when the Spanish entered the territory. Rather than forming the basis for a colonial administration, their political institutions were largely cut out of the colonial system in the 17th century when the Spanish decided to make their own regional capital (modern day Morelia) to bypass native authority.
astonishingly well written’ I learn a lot here. Your rundown of a place I didn’t know existed til 30 mins ago is fabulous.. All my life I’ve pictured loosely this silly scenario of ancient MesoAmerica being like... just the ol Razzie Azzies and The Mighty Mayans being the only 2 factions, (like the Hatfields & McCoys, just those 2 fighting for Ks of years.. over the same ol recurring feud about stolen warthog-or was it a girl) ? Lol.
There have been two recent PhD dissertations that provide the most comprehensive overview so far of the American lead research at the (probably misnamed) site of Angamuco on the east side of the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin. The first, by , looks at the site's ceramic chronology. The second, by , looks at the site's road network. You can download both as pdfs through the link provided (the pdf link itself is on the left hand side of the page). Being dissertations, these book-lenh documents are very data heavy. If you decide to read them, you may want to skip over most of the body chapters and focus on the intro and conclusion chapters, unless you have a burning curiosity for the nuts and bolts of archaeological research.
