I have no idea what they are applying for. It's none of my business and this information was not shared with me as I am NOT involved in any of his care or his finances or care. At all.
The way the system is set up is that the money a person has saved is to be used first for their care before relying on the taxpayers even if this means no inheritance for heirs.
What would happen is that grandfather’s care would not be paid for — and if there is a thought that this was done in an attempt to commit Medicaid fraud that would be problematic for all involved.
If someone improperly transfers assets there will be a penalty period— which means Medicaid will not pay during that time.
The transfer was not made to qualify for Medicaid, continue to qualify for Medicaid, or avoid estate recovery.
The presumption is that the client or the spouse transferred the asset to qualify for Medicaid, continue to qualify, or avoid estate recovery. The client must rebut that presumption by providing convincing evidence.
In order to rebut the presumption, the client must present convincing evidence of what the specific purpose of the transfer was. Transferring for gifts, inheritance, avoiding probate, or preservation of an estate does not rebut the presumption that the transfer was to qualify for Medicaid or avoid estate recovery. Further, it is the purpose of the transfer to the recipient, not what the recipient will be using the transferred assets for.
