I'm not American and I'm afraid I don't follow your reference to people making claims about literacy rates in early America. I recall reading a NZ history of education that said that the early European settlers of NZ were quite literate by the standards of the day - should I be doubtful about that too? The author didn't come across as having a particular political view. [Edit: a vague memory stirred: this is an argument of the home-schooling movement and American libertarians?].
Exceptions can be found among education historians who focus on education history in Asia, especially China, as there were large-scale exam systems that serve as a proxy for literacy tests. Generally speaking, if someone is making a claim about literacy rates in early America, they're advocating for a particular approach to education and their claims should be taken with a grain of salt.
Regardless of when, where, or who, the general sentiment of formal education for a society's children has been based on the supposition that an educated population was better than an un-educated one. This wasn't necessarily about control, per se. What's often described as ways to control the population can be more accurately described as efforts to manage large groups of small humans, in the same space at the same time. Gathering children together in one place under one adult's supervision required rules and structures in order to be safe. In many cases, those rules and structures were borrowed from the cultural norms of those doing the teachers. As an example, prior to the rise of the common school movement (aka public education) in America, most teachers were men who freely used corporal punishment and public humiliation as a way to control their pupils. When the profession was feminized in the later half of the 19th century, the women teachers used routines from their typically Protestant, working or middle class backgrounds as a way to keep things manageable in the classroom. This meant walking in a single file line, sitting quietly at a desk with hands folded, calling the teacher "Miss" or "Mr", among other things.
