Quote from Humeniuk: "Yesterday we reported about 260 square kilometres and today over 3,000 square kilometres have been liberated. Though there are still areas where enemy forces might linger.".
Russias military strenh is completely undermined by corruption from top to bottom. You sa y they can hit back harder - they canâ€™t. They can target civilians with drones - until Ukraine gets better defense systems. What Russia really hopes is that the Dnipro river will now prevent advances in the south so they can concentrate forces in the north and fight to a stalemate long enough that peace negotiations will look attractive. But that May never happen. The west.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine have liberated around 3,000 square kilometres of land in southern Ukraine over the course of the past 24 hours, and have therefore increased the total area of liberated territory tenfold.
Well said. If we learned anything from the war in Afghanistan, I think it should be that we cannot give liberty to another culture. They have to want it so badly that a critical mass of the population is willing to fight and die for it.
