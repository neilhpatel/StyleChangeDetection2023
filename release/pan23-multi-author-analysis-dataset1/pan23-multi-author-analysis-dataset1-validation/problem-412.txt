Is there anything on interactions in the ancient world (particularly Greece and especially Rome) between slaves and the free poor? I have read, for example, that some free labourers are reported to have camped with Spartacus’ army, and it is well established that slaves worked alongside free Romans in a number of jobs. Is there any evidence of solidarity or resentment between these factions (considering how wealthy freedmen could become)? Are there any primary sources, like lawsuits or testimonials? I’m mostly interested in seeing whether slaves and non-slave owning Romans ever interacted as friends, lovers, enemies etc, or whether they were completely distinct social classes that rarely interacted outside of work.
Oooh. I actually do not know too many works that look to the transnational legal/ideological influences on the Holocaust. But, I would strongly recommend, if your class did not have you read it, Ordinary Men, since it focuses on the on-the-ground social dynamics of those who carried out the genocide.
