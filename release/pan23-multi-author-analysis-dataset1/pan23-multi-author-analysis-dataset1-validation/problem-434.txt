Since you're asking about Indian coins, let's start with Roman Alexandria, the western terminus of the Indian Ocean trade. The currency of Roman Egypt was closely regulated. All of the province's coins (debased silver and bronze) were minted in Alexandria, and all other currency, even from neighboring provinces, was forbidden. Partly because Egypt's monetary system was closed, coins tended to say in circulation for a long time. The second hoard , buried in Alexandria sometime in the late second century CE, included coins minted in the reign of Nero, more than a century before. So old coins were not a problem in Alexandria - but foreign coins would have been. A merchant carrying Indian coins would have had to exchange his money (probably at the provincial border) before buying anything.
Not quite. The whole thing about Gresham's law is that the bad coins circulate while the good coins are hoarded because of the divergence in nominal value vs actual value. The good circulate much more slowly. Furthermore if old coins are no longer legal tender it might make sense to trade them abroad if that gets you more bang for the buck than selling them back to the mint. But one thing people often don't consider is that if a government doesn't devalue it's coin, then the old coins become the bad coins due to wear and tear as well as the illegal practice of clipping. This brings with it a host of other problems, such as uncertainty over the actual value of coins in circulation. The main point of trading in coins as opposed to pieces of valuable metals is that you can be reasonable certain a coin represents a standardized weight of metal. Standardization reduces transactional friction, making the process of buying and selling easier and faster. Devaluing in this situation creates a new standard weight, restoring certainty in the value of coins. So this is one among other legitimate reasons why it can make sense to devalue coins, provided it's not excessive and not done so often that people lose trust in the system. So for example the English mint under the Normans would for a long time follow the principle that "everybody knows" is good money management, i.e. never devaluing the coin. However, over time the problems with that approach became obvious enough that the mint switched to devaluing on average once in a generation.
