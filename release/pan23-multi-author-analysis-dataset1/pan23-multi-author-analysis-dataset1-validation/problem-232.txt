I don’t have any teenage kids bro, I’m speaking for myself, and that movie, and the book affected me in College, and not positively. Did I become the character? No, but I was confused. Also, nice manners bud. Have a great day!

This is so fucked. The FL statute sets out very specific kinds of content that is prohibited. But, apparently, FL approved training and sent out government agents to tell people that what they really need to be removing material that is “harmful to children”. A subjective standard that inevitably leads to public schools removing and not teaching subjects that are not prohibited by FL law. Schools now err on the side of not teaching students and hiding books from them.
