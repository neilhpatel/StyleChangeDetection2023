You see, because of archaic rules made long ago for any bill introduced that isn't directly tied to funding for the government either party can argue against it until either they stop arguing or a supermajority vote (67 in the Senate) is given to end the discussion. More recently while Republicans had control they updated it to "has the intention to filibuster" so they can just say they would and it is considered on pause til the vote is given to end it. This essentially hamstrings any effort Democrats make to pass anything (such as gun control) in the Senate. Now, rules to the filibuster (including killing it) could be changed with a simple majority vote but two senators, Sinema (was a Democrat aligned 3rd party but recently declared she is neutral) and Manchin (a DINO, but technically still a Democrat...his predecessor made the rules and he doesn't want to destroy it) have vowed to vote against any measure doing so, making the vote for it stand at 51-49 with Republicans winning the vote to keep it how it is. So it doesn't matter if Democrats control the Senate unless they have enough Senators to kill the filibuster they can't do anything about it.
"Tell me you don't know how the Senate filibuster works without telling me you don't know how the Senate filibuster works".
