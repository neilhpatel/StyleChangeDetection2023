followup question: I never received any official notices of termination or delay. I was informed by an employee/director there, but never given anything stating "sorry, we've decided to go another route" or "sorry, this position is no longer available." would this have any weight?
Estoppel is very difficult to argue, and it is expensive to bring a lawsuit for it, and we are really trying to drive home the point that you MIGHT have a detrimental reliance argument, but you need to temper your expectations and adjust your understanding that (a) the company is who you sue, not the person; (b) the company has no money to collect; (c) this is probably not a dispute in which you can be awarded attorney fees ordinarily, so any legal expenses will offset any potential judgement... that you will almost assuredly not collect.
Not glib at all. I appreciate the clarification. My counterpoints, even if Iâ€™m wrong about them, come from a place of genuinely trying to understand the situation, so again, thank you for taking the time to explain.
