In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Brilliant. Then there's age restrictions. Will the fetus be allowed in 18 and over only places? And what about privacy issues? Will the mother be charged for indecency and exposure to a minor if she takes a shower/bath with a fetus? And what if it's a boy fetus? Will the mother be forced to wear boys clothing lest she be charged with grooming a trans fetus? So many many questions!
i was about to say that this is weird n all but like if they wanna do something actually helpful to everyone and productive then make child support start immediately and let parents add the fetus to their taxes for deductions. in the unfortunate event of a miscarriage issue a death certificate and benefits. that would actually move their point along and help people. but hey thanks for letting us in the car pull lane i guess . texas is so weird.
That second person is an undocumented illegal immigrant. (they weren’t born in America) the “Mother” is aiding and abetting illegal immigration into the United States.
