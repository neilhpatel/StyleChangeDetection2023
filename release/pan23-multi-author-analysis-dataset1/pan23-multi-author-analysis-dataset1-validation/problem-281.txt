Russia just announced they are expanding to 1.5 million troops. US commits another $2.5 billion including armored vehicles. A shitload of additional support announced from other Ukraine allies today.
Exactly. Nobody thought Russia would cross this line and they did, there's no telling what they'll do if they win in Ukraine. They either get stopped in Ukraine, or they get stopped in a NATO member, which significantly increases the real risks of nuclear war.
It’s literally unbelievably important. For years US military doctrine treated Russia as a near-peer threat with enormous resources and strategy dedicated to dealing with them. Intelligence surely indicated the rampant corruption and less than ideal maintenance and logistical problems Russia had… But even Russia themselves really didn’t have any idea of how bad it was until they tried to move out. With the Ukraine War it’s pretty obvious Russia is not even on the same planet as most modern militaries; Ukraine is stalemating or winning nearly every engagement and don’t even have any air or naval power, and the equipment they are being given is predominantly decades old technology.
1. Not only is it a very small fraction of the overall military budget, it's a small fraction of the military budget from many years ago. This equipment has been paid for for a long time, and the values presented are as if the equipment has being re-bought brand new. It's old inventory, not in use. While it's not EOL yet, it's not like this is brand new either.
Finding out that one of your two biggest rivals is effectively neutered in conventional combat allows you to dedicate significantly more resources to the other rival (China) and work on ensuring you can counter them more effectively.
2. Having a friendly country offer to use $2.5bn worth of your equipment against technologically inferior opposing forces, when you yourself can't strike at that enemy for fear of global war, and that opposition is a historical enemy and is probably your second largest threat on the world stage currently, is an absurdly good deal. Military spending on defence rarely gets such a clear payoff, and when you're already a stronger economy, even trading $2.5bn of equipment evenly is an amazing strategic victory.
