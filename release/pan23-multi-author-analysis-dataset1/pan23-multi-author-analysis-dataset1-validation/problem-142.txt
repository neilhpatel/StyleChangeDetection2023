Arguably (the arguments are bad, but they're there) it's not, which is why China is so annoyed with Putin. China has consistently said that because Taiwan is "special" in that they never established sovereignty on a global-scale (deeply flawed argument, but technically true since even the US has been slow to recognize them) they are different from countries like Ukraine and (reading between the lines) therefore can be invaded without violation of sovereignty.
Just do what? Show powers? Or what else? Just the fact that many questions are still yet pinned inside me though!
China was practically 100% isolationist and heavily agrarian. Folks, including them (apparently) forget that prior to Nixonâ€™s visit and opening up to international trade, China was a very poor country. This only changed in the last 40yrs, or so.
Both of these first and second gen groups are missing to see the value of relative (I said relative because what we have in the US is not absolute and is corrupted by money) freedom of speech and rule of law they enjoy in the US (in China and Myanmar, a son/daughter of a high level government official can get away after killing someone in a car crash for example; in the US, at least it'll not be that easy). I recently made a to two second gen Chinese folks, but I don't think one of them is pleased. I hope they understand the nuances and don't take some racial injustices they experienced in US/Canada as justification to hate on the country which have hosted their families and provided them with a better quality of life than they would have if they are in China.
The surprising thing is the second gen (Chinese Canadians/Chinese Americans) who wants to side with China just because they have a chip on their shoulder about racial abuses they have experienced in their birth countries (Canada/US). They seem to (wrongly, in my opinion) think that China is doing everything better than the US and they want China to win if there is a war (I hope it doesn't happen ever) between the US and China just to show that their race is superior or to teach a lesson to white people or something like that.
I can understand why first gen (e.g., Chinese citizen who came to the US for college/masters degree and then decide to stay because s/he can make more money working for a tech company; or old folks who have settled in the US for a long time and are set in their ways of thinking and only consume Chinese media--mainly due to language barriers--and therefore, brainwashed) expats would think China is better than the US in terms of how they behave in the world.
