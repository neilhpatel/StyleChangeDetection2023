The property manager is aware that my lease is ending, and he is aware of my sublet situation. My last month's rent has already been paid to the landlord.
Just to be clear, I've already paid every single month's rent until the end of my tenancy. As per my lease, that is technically my only obligation (I'm not sure in what capacity I am responsible for my sublet). I just assumed that once my lease ends, since I have paid the rent and my possessions are not in that apartment, I can simply leave and if my sublet does not leave it is then my landlord's problem.
Wait - so if my lease ends on August 25 and my sublet does not leave, I may still have to pay a pro-rated rent by the day AFTER my lease expires??
The usual compromise for remedying this loss is to assume that your tenancy is extended by necessity until you actually return possession, and to obligate you to pay at the rate you agreed to until the tenancy actually ends and your landlord recovers possession. Since you will likely occupy the unit for less than a full month afterwards, the Board usually pro-rates that obligation by the day.
