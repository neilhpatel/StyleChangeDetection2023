This person is not actually your tenant. This person is a tenant of the three people with the lease. He cannot "apparently" take over your lease, you would need to sign off on that. So he is a subtenant of at least one of the other three people. He technically does not owe you rent, since he was never officially put onto the lease, your original three tenants owe the rent to you, and he owes to them. Technically.
Rent not paid being the obvious. But: pets in the unit, subletting not allowed, abandoning the unit for over 7 days, guests staying longer than 48 hours. The default clause says that the contract is terminated if the tenant does not pay or if any of these clauses are violated which is grounds for immediate termination and vacancy right?
Yes. You'd give the original three people a "Ten day notice to cure." If they do not somehow (legally) get rid of the subtenant within ten days then you'd file an unlawful detainer (eviction) suit against the three, plus the one, in your county court, and you'd win, and you'd work with the sheriff's department to have someone come to perform the eviction.
