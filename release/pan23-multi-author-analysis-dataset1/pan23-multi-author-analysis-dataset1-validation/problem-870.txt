In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Oh look. Nothing to do with rules or the Constitution. Basic human dignity and respect is thought to be a “new standard” by a Republican. Interesting….
That is the hardest part about freedom of speech. Is that hate groups can form together and talk all they want about how much they hate another race, religion or creed. And it's perfectly legal.
I mean, take anything they say with a huge grain of salt, but if it was to get Mace, a Republican representative, on board she might actually not want her party to turn into (more of) a clown show about booting people every time their feelings get hurt.
There it is. Make an announcement that you are really super duper really going to follow the rules. Not suspicious at all.
