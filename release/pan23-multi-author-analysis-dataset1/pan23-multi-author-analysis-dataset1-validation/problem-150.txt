Fusion is a nuclear reaction that combines two atoms to create one or more new atoms with slightly less total mass. The difference in mass is released as energy, as described by Einstein’s famous equation, E = mc2 , where energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Since the speed of light is enormous, converting just a tiny amount of mass into energy – like what happens in fusion – produces a similarly enormous amount of energy.
Fusion energy has been the “holy grail” of energy production for nearly half a century. While a gain of 1.5 is, I believe, a truly historic scientific breakthrough, there is still a long way to go before fusion is a viable energy source.
There has been a breakthrough in nuclear fusion recently that shows a great deal of promise but is still many years off.
American scientists have announced what they have called a major breakthrough in a long-elusive goal of creating energy from nuclear fusion.
Not easy. Not even feasible. Currently there are no mature technologies that allow grid scale storage for a single day, with one exception, let alone the weeks worth of storage you'd need for intermittents to provide baseload power.
Lol what? Germany is an example of what not to do with energy policies. They built nuclear power plants just to decommission them for the purpose of using Putin's oil&gas + coal.
