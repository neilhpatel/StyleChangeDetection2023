Nobody at her fitness club wants to touch it.. can we please just not report on everything she says. It will die under shade but grow under the light of the press.
In order for things to change people have to recognize the problem but every time anybody criticizes the democratic party you get a horde of people who will tell you, youâ€™re a right winger for saying so and basically there is no justified criticism of the Dems to so many. The system is broken and has no way of changing because corporations have succeeded in domesticating americans into cattle that will defend the system that makes them suffer. I mean look at the rail unions posts you got people who genuinely think its okay to force rail workers to work and prevent them from striking simply because of the consequences to the nation. LIKE THATS WHY ALL THEIR DEMANDS SHOULD BE MET, not why congress should be barring them from striking while still not giving them what theyre striking over.
