I recently had a mold issue in my apartment and it was hell with the landlord. Just like your situation, they insisted it was anything other than mold. From their perspective, I think it’s a liability thing so they probably have to deny that it’s mold. I ended up buying a $40 mold test kit and when the results came back they were quick to remedy the situation. Maybe that’s something you could look into for your classroom. If they have lab confirmation that there is mold they’re more likely to act on it rather than make excuses. I’m not sure about what legal routes are available to you, but this may be a faster way to get it resolved if they’re in denial. 🤷‍♀️.
If the complaint route doesn’t work, maybe try discussing hiring an independent/third party industrial hygienist to come do air sampling so that they can tell you if the mold is causing the issues. They’ll provide you with an expert’s evaluation of the situation which would ultimately force your employer’s hand if the hazard has been documented.
