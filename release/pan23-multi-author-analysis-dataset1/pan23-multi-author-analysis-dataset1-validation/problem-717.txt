Retaliation is a term that has specific meaning under state and federal law. What counts as "retaliatory" depends on the law as written, as well as any cases interpreting that law. To know if your facts meet this definition, you would need to speak with an attorney licensed in California, and hopefully one who practices employment law (and even better if they represent employees, some only represent employers). Google can find you some names.
I know not providing prep time is not illegal, but I also think it perpetuates issues in education to tell teachers it’s normal and common not to get prep time, because it’s not. Teachers accept these sub par conditions in many places because they assume it’s that way everywhere. I wasn’t arguing that it’s illegal, but with your claim that most teachers get no prep time during the day. I think that is misleading and not overly helpful to the OP. Many states also have laws limiting what you can teach outside of your certification area. Where I live, that is a state Ed law, not a contractual stipulation. Not sure about CA though.
Here is the thing - businesses act like they know what they are doing because they say "Ah, well legal prepared this contract" but sometimes they have no idea what they are doing and just handing out a form generated by administrative staff saved from when they last had a lawyer take a look six years ago. The reason, if I were you, I'd want to hire a lawyer, is because of all the steps they are taking. Why, if they could just fire you, don't they? Why are they playing this whole game of "here is a new contract for 50% pay? It doesn't add up.
