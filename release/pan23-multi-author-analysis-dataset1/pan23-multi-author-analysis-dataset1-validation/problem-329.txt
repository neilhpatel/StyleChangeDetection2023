My personal favorites are “You’re going to have to answer to the Coca Cola company” or “a feller could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that stuff.” delivered by two of the great Hollywood character actors…Keenan Wynn as Colonel Bat Guano and Slim Pickens as Major King Kong.
Russia: It wasn't us? Well we can't just tell them it wasn't us, we always say that when it was us. There's no point. Just let it ring, they either figure it out on their own or they don't...
“Polish President Andrzej Duda asserted earlier today: "Ukraine's defence was launching their missiles in various directions and it is highly probable that one of these missiles unfortunately fell on Polish territory."”.
Anyone who was instructed to “duck and cover” under your school desk in case of a nuclear attack and wore dog tags so someone would be able to identify our bodies has a clearer understanding, but I also didn’t grow up during the depression and I can enjoy the shit out of William Powell, Myrna Loy, and Asta. It was the shear lunacy that was ludicrous but somehow still as easily believable as MASH or Catch 22. Is parody dead? If I remember right, the Marx Brothers were called madcap, but very few folks find any humor in Groucho and Chico any more.
