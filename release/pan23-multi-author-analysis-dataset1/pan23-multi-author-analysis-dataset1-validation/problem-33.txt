This really helped I'm like obsessed of the downfall of the han dynasty and Yuan Shao is one of my favorite warlords. Thank you so much. But do you know why Yuan Shao's top advisers and generals defecated over to Cao Cao? And Why Guan Yu was able to kill his top two generals so easily? (I think one of Cao Cao's generals killed Wen Chao) I forgot his name. But why did they die so fast? Thank you again! I love this sub reddit.
Traditionally, Yuan Shao's failure with overwhelming odds was seen as arrogant, his marching on Guandu part of that overwhelming confidence, his failure to properly support or develop a multi-pronged attack but committing most of his forces against one front lacking imagination and flexibility. Of listening to the wrong advisers and ignoring those with more flexible and imaginative plans. That he was far inferior to Cao Cao as a leader and of moral character, everything Cao Cao was he was not.
Guandu was Cao Cao's iconic victory and Wei historians built it up for all they could. Yuan Shao became the representative of the old guard, the old nobility, arrogant, too lenient on the power, relying on family fame. Cao Cao representing the change, the dynamic representation of the new age, the figure who overcame terrifying odds via his superior leadership and character. Wei distanced Yuan Shao's role in Cao Cao's rise (they would also claim victory in a battle Cao Cao lost to the Yuan sons), they (at the very least) exaggerated the number gap between the two sides when the conflict came and they built a narrative around it.
It would not be true to say Cao Cao had everyone behind him, critic Kong Rong was wary of war, the Emperor tried to get Cao Cao killed over Cao Cao's control (and killing his friends) but Dong Cheng's plot unravelled, Xu Tao tried to assassinate him, several officers seem to have had exchanges with members of Yuan Shao's camp (perhaps keeping their options open but also several did have friends in Yuan Shao's camp). However, Cao Cao didn't have to jail his advisers and during the war, his advisers and his generals didn't seem to have fallen out with each other.
