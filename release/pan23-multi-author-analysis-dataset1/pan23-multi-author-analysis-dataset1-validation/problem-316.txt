As you may all be aware, I'm obsessed with submarines in the First World War, particularly their usage by the Allies. I've known of a movie called The Hell Below (1933) for maybe 2ish years now, and I thought that was the only one about American submarines during the war.
And then today I found a list of submarine movies, and listed was one called "The Seas Beneath" from 1931, about an American Schooner that disguises itself to draw a U-Boat out. All the while it's towing an American submarine poised to ambush the UBoat when it shows itself.
J. R. R. Tolkien is given a lot of credit for his worldbuilding in The Hobbit (1937), The Lord of the Rings trilogy (1954-1955), and The Silmarillion (1977), but it's important to remember that many other writers around the same time participated in extensive worldbuilding tooâ€”they just didn't always write extended works based on that, or they didn't have the opportunity to have those works published. For Catherine Lucille Moore and her cousin, very little of their quasi-medieval Atlantean epics survive - bits and pieces in her letters to H. P. Lovecraft and R. H. Barlow, but not much that has been published. Robert E. Howard's epic history of his Conan and Kull stories, , and the map he drew, weren't published until after he died.
