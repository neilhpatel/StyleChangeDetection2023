Democrats has already started to destroy our democracy: using Twitter to censor conservative’s voice, using FBI to its own political agenda, shutting down Biden Hunter’s story, promoting cancel culture, which is the exact same to Chinese communist dictatorship.
AND the DOJ does not care. Why would Republicans care? The former president of Brazil left because he would be in jail right now. Trump should be also. He’s making a mockery of our country while praising North Korea at 1AM this morning. Our DOJ is a disgrace.
Unfortunately, a giant rebellion to ensure the continued wealth of the ultra-rich at the cost of literally everyone else is extremely in-line with America's values.
I don’t agree anymore. I did agree with this statement last year. But not anymore. My boyfriend is an attorney. He was a prosecutor for seven years. He’s baffled also. Georgia is moving right along. Trump should have been treated just the same way as Reality Winner was treated. Charged and held. The J6 committee already laid out a case and recommended charges. The DOJ should have been ahead in that. He will not be charged. I’m convinced of that. IF for some odd reason he is they will drop charges later because of a new DOJ head. It’s over with.
