The third is that he lost many of the bitterest and most consequential struggles of his time. His efforts on behalf of freedmen ultimately failed. His attempts to preserve peaceful and lawful elections in the South were insufficient. His desire to treat Native Americans more fairly was largely overruled. These were failures driven by popular opinion and they speak to some ugly truths about the American political system and the American people of that time. For example, Grant refused to send in federal troops to quell white supremacist terrorism and preserve the Reconstruction government in Mississippi because he was convinced that if he did so the Republican party, his party, would lose the elections in Ohio. Grant wrote about that particular decision "I should not have yielded . . . I believed at the time I was making a grave mistake. But as presented, it was duty on one side, and party obligation on the other. Between the two I hesitated, but finally yielded to what I believed was my party obligation . . . It requires no prophet to foresee that the national government will soon be at a great disadvantage and that the results of the war of the rebellion will have been in large measure lost . . . What you have just passed through in the state of Mississippi is only the beginning of what is sure to follow. I do not wish to create unnecessary alarm, nor be locked upon as a prophet of evil, but it is impossible for me to close my eyes in the face of things that are as plain to me as the noonday sun." as quoted in Grant by Chernow on pg. 817-818.
Currently reading the book (now at Johnson-Grant debacle over Stanton's resignation/firing), pretty much the very reason why I'm infatuated with Grant at the moment. Anyway.
Likewise, despite growing up in California and learning about Native American genocides, the Trail of Tears and such in the East, I did not learn in my pre-college days that California itself had seen some of the most horrific and recent such slaughters in the country. I was not taught that a past governor of the state had put a public bounty out on "Indian scalps" and that some among the gold miners that we have murals of and name sports teams after had used kidnapped native children as slaves, fully within the bounds of state law.
