I am a landlord (not yours), the law (at least in California) prohibits me to do anything until your leases ends. If you are on a fixed term lease, then I cannot do anything until the lease expires. But I will definitely not be renewing it.
How would you get evicted if still paying rent and waiting for a judge's decision you're not making any sense property owners and realtors dont make laws are enforce them there main reason for all there actions is money why should he haft to pay more a month plus find a new place because he was lied to you dont even need a lawyer everything being done to you is out of greed not law learn your rights more then likely they owe them three free months of rent to find a place are 30 days and are given three months of rent in cash you cant just force someone out there home.
Not really. The lease was monthbto month when we moved in two years ago. We asked the landlord to write us up a one year lease as a favor so we weren’t thrown out and the realtor told him not to. It’s so fucked up.
Dude seriously save it you sound dumb as shit as a tenant he has rights month to month lease are not it still falls under local laws and state laws as a tenant you have rights, if not the property owners would walk all over you a judge will work out a fair agreement notice a JUDGE you can not be evicted for following the law and that was not done by the property owners OP has more leverage then he thinks and you think like a sheep.
Do not do this. It may take a while, but eventually you will get evicted. If the landlord is willing to give you ninety days, they're probably willing to take the time to go through the legal eviction process. Having an eviction on your record will make it much harder to find housing in the future, and will make what you can find rather more expensive.
