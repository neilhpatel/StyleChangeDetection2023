Ask the lender then ask your realtor to ask the builder. It's just a certificate that gets issued alongside new construction and while the certificate won't mention property description there is usually an inspection card filled out alongside it that will state how the property will be deeded with the county.
I'd escalate with the lender. They're supposed to be intelligent enough to figure out what is what. If the appraiser was not correct then the lender will inform them to make the correction, as the appraiser works for the lender.
ETA: if your lender says this cannot be changed then the appraiser is likely correct. You're going to need to find a different lender, if yours won't make a condo loan. What another lender might have done, is immaterial - if that lender erred they may be required to buy back the loan or find a different investor to sell it to. That loan might have closed, but you have no way of knowing if that lender acted appropriately or made a mistake that wasn't caught until it was too late.
