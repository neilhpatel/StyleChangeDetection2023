Volumes have been written about what happened in 1066 itself – about the military tactics of the two armies (Norman castles and cavalry against Saxon shield walls; Norman discipline against Saxon impetuousness and so on), not to mention about the role of hard fighting and blind luck in determining the outcome of Hastings itself – the battle lasted the best part of a day and was exceptionally evenly contested by the standards of the time, and a considerable part of the eventual outcome of the campaign as a whole was determined simply by the fact that Harold and three of his brothers died in the course of the campaigns of that year, all of which meant that the only viable remaining Saxon candidate for the throne on Harold's death was Edgar Atheling, a boy of only 14. But I want to stress a couple of other things in wrapping up this response.
If I am not wrong, historically Britain was already a backwater when the Romans were on the Island, and became an absolute mess in the centuries following their departure and before the unification of the old Anglo-Saxon kingdom of England, so what allowed England to become so sophisticated, more so than other ex-regions of the Roman Empire that had seen higher degree of sophistication and urbanisation for much longer ?
If I don't doubt of the sophistication and the strenh of the England of the 11th century, I have a hard time believing that Anglo-Saxon England was stronger than Al-Andalus, Aragon, the HRE or other states west of Constantinople, or more sophisticated than the Italian city states that punched so much above their weight for so long.
You underline that saying strongest and most sophisticated west of the Byzantine Empire might not be exactly true, given that it's probably difficult to assert that a particular state is definitely stronger than all the other except if that difference is gigantic, like the difference between Rome and everyone else in antiquity I guess, but at the same time you don't really seem to disagree with that notion.
This would make a really good topic for a research paper. 1. There were about 4 contenders for the English throne at the time. The reigning king was Harold Godwinson, as well as his brother, Tostig Godwinson, added to that was the king of Norway, Harald Hardrada, and lastly, our friend William Duke of Normandy. In 1066, Hardrada claimed he was the rightful king of England. He had a thing for trying to take over kingdoms, as 2 years earlier he had claimed the throne of Denmark, but was reppelled. He was a battle hardened warrior who had fought in Russia and served in the varangian guard in Constantinople. He took his men to england, where he allied with Tostig, and was prepared to take the english throne. A harsh battle ensued at Stamford Bridge where the Saxons defeated the Northmen and Tostig and Hardrada were both killed in the battle, slightly weakening haralds saxon army, and leaving only two "kings of england". Now normandy was not French per se, it was in fact Viking. Normandy was founded by the Viking chieftain Rollo, who gave his alliance to the Frankish king and became of christian. Many viking warriors under Rollo became Normans and many french settled there too. Next when William made it to Hastings, where the battle ensued, some things happened. The saxon fyrds were mostly farmers who can be called upon during times of war, while most of the Normans were a professional Army. Also, the Saxon army still fought in ancient Germanic fashion, mostly on foot and in a shield wall, while the normans utilized heavy cavalry and long range archery. Another thing is that the Norman soldiers were better equipped. The Saxons still had those all too familiar Round wooden shields that are popularized by the Vikings, but also were common among most Germanic Peoples. The saxon bow was inferior, and so were the weapons. The Normans came with better armour, sharper and harder weapons, bigger shields that did better at protecting a man and a formation, most carried large long lances on horseback. The normans are often what we think of when we think of an early knight, while an anglo saxon warrior would look strikingly similar to a Norse Viking. It also didnt help that King Harald was killed in the battle of Hastings, ensuring the the remaning forces would fall into chaos and very unlikely to be able to reform successfully. From here on out, the saxons were basically fighting a gurilla war, almost like that of the Gauls fighting the Romans. Soon, the only remains of Anglo Saxon England that had ruled for 500 years were small pockets in Northumbria.
