It's also worth noting that Reagan's tax cuts helped stimulate economic growth, created new job opportunities and allowed for more disposable income for consumers, all of which contributed to a more robust and healthy economy.
Only read the headlines? Carter inherited a decade+ of monetizing the debt to pay for 'Nam from LBJ, Nixon and Ford. The Fed refused to continue this practice and when the US had to borrow to pay for the worthless war, it literally sucked up all the available cash, reducing the supply of money for other borrowers, who (like happens in times of serious shortage) drove the price of money (interest rates) thru the roof, and the price of everything else followed the money.
That's every version. "Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that." There's a reason that Borg boarding tactics are just "stand there until you get shot.".
Let's not forget that Reagan inherited a struggling economy from the previous administration, with high inflation and interest rates, a stagnant growth rate, and high unemployment. He implemented a set of policies aimed at revitalizing the economy and creating jobs, which, while controversial, did ultimately lead to a period of sustained economic growth known as the Reagan boom.
