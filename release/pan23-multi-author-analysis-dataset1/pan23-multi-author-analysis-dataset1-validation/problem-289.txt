Very nice Thanks The events I'm focusing on take place in Kyoto and areas east of it, ranging between 1530 to 1570. There is a lot going on in this period, but there is a lot of information available - at least regarding the politics of that time and the military campaigns. I've been having more difficulty finding good descriptions of the details of day-to-day life in those times. How common were inns along the roads between the cities and towns? What sort of food would a foot soldier typically be given to eat? How would an Oiran's career be affected if she became pregnant? Items like that are hard to track down. But the search goes on! ).
