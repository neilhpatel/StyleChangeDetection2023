Communists: Obviously the betrayal at Shanghai resulted in a cemented hatred of Chiang among pretty much all CCP officials. Still, Wang Jingwei was out there, in Wuhan, and was a very real threat to Chiang's authority. But Wang really wasn't a communist, and he didn't like Mao or Chen Duxiu any more than he liked Chiang. Wang was really just looking for a way in, into that sweet seat of leadership that he would only find through Japanese collaboration. While most communists decided to wage war against the KMT with their newly created People's Liberation Army, Wang decided to cut ties with the CCP and ally with the two powerful Central Plains warlords, Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan, who rebelled, and then were defeated by Chiang, in 1931. This forced Wang to come to the table with Chiang, and he finally accepted a position as premier of China in the KMT. Chiang was still leery of Wang though, and Chiang basically turned the position into a diplomatic one. Throughout the 1930s until Japanese invasion, Wang would spend most of his time abroad on orders by Chiang, especially in Germany.
