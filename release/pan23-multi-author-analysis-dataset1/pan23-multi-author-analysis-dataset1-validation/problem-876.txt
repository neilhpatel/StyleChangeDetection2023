Anyone with a clue knew russia was going to do this after they made those empty accusations that Ukraine is planning to do it.
Not necessarily. Blowing up the damn intentionally is a textbook war crime but now they just have recklessly damaged the dam when blowing up the road on top of the dam. It could still be a war crime (due to reckless endangerment), but I would not say it is "textbook".
I would not say it is terrorism, but it is very likely a war crime. Targeting valid military targets (in this case a road which has potential military use for Ukraine) near a dam is a war crime if there is a risk that attack destroys the dam.
Of late? Even McCain used to hang out on Oleg Deripaskaâ€™s yacht. His campaign manager Rick Davis was a business partner of Paul Manafort and Roger Stone.
What you get at most is a very literal obeying of commands, and everything having to be exactly commanded or they don't do it, which takes a lot of time and effort, but that is indistinguishable from inexperience or lack of initiative so it's probably has become the normal situation for Russians.
No, they just damaged it when they blew up the road on it. Let's hope the damage is not so bad that it breaks. Reckless but not an attempt to blow it up.
