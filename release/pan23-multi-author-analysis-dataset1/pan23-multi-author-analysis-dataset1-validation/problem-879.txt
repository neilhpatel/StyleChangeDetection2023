It is indeed fascinating how the whole world was looking at Spain at this moment in history - it's exactly what sucked me into the topic checks notes ...many years ago. The international dimensions of the Spanish Civil War fascinated people at the time and ever since, and so there is, in theory, a huge amount of scholarship on the ways in which Italians, Russians, Albanians and many other nationalities ended up fighting in Spain.
Wow. Best answer I have ever seen on Askhistorians. This is an area I have always been interested in, having read Hemingway and Orwellâ€™s accounts of volunteering but this was nevertheless extremely illuminating. Thank you!
It definitely wasn't irrelevant, though I've never seen much in the way of evidence that People's Olympiad participants were that numerous or central to the actual fighting in Barcelona - Beevor put the figure at a couple of hundred who stayed to fight, for instance, but doesn't offer a source, and given the nature of that book my suspicion is that he's just repeating something he read somewhere without much thought. More to the point, the early involvement of foreigners in the initial fighting, followed by the initial wave of relatively spontaneous, disparate volunteering, isn't what made Spain unusual - had this pattern continued, we'd have seen maybe a few thousand foreign volunteers, scattered fairly widely across a range of units and medical services, with recruitment flows slowing to a trickle by the beginning of 1937. What changed the game was the strategic Soviet decision to actively organise and recruit abroad, utilising the international communist networks that they'd spent the best part of two decades building up as a precursor to global revolution. As such, rather than continuing to taper off, recruiting was redoubled over the winter of 1936-7, and maintained at significant levels until spring 1938, with the volunteers serving in dedicated, highly-visible units. While you can certainly argue that the prominent involvement of foreigners in the first weeks of the conflict may have helped inspire this decision, it doesn't really help us explain why the decision changed the picture so profoundly. If nothing else, the direct inspirational value of these figures on actual prospective volunteers generally wasn't enough by itself - most lacked the knowledge, resources and connections to do it independently.
Great answer! What do you think of the impact of the sportsmen from the People's Olympia in Barcelona who, if I remember, joined the Republicans to help them gain control of Catalonia in the first days after the "Golpe"? Maybe having an international proletarian presence already there had a strong impact and could have helped kickstart the process.
