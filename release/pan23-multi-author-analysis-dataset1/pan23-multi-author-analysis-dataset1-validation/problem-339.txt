Absolutely not. This is a monumental misunderstanding of Chinese foreign policy. The minute China pays Russia in Yuan for oil and NG is the minute the US and EU sanction China. Over 50% of the export market. It would be disastrous to the Chinese economy.
>Putin tells Xi he wants to ramp up military cooperation – Russian leader Vladimir Putin told Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday he was keen to ramp up military cooperation and hailed the two countries' efforts to counter Western influence make enemies of your top 10 largest trading partners for a country that has almost nothing China wants and a GDP roughly the size of Brazil...
How? This is like the 20th time Putins begged Xi, Xi and the rest of Asia then told Putin to get fucked and even his allies have made him pay full price for their old rusted stockpiles while conspiring with the rest of Asia - before the US could organize OPEC to even agree to do it - to use the situation to their advantage and force Russia to sell them oil and gas at a massive discount.
In what fantastical delusional world does Xi or any of Asia cooperate with this massive loser in escalating to a world war - Russia can't take Ukraine while they're getting nato handouts, any ally in a world war must see themselves doing 98% of the actual conquering.
