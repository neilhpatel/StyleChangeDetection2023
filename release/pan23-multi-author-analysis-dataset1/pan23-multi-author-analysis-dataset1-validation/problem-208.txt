The assault on Ukraine's Donbas region remains "very difficult," with Russian forces having effectively "destroyed" Bakhmut, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Biden said it well a few months back... I can't see an offramp from this for Putin... the only question that matters now... how long does the world continue to allow this sort of evil to take place and only respond by strong words, and hap hazard military strategies? NATO when into the Former Yugoslavia to stop them from slaughtering eachother. When do we stop allowing others to be slaughtered in such a manner? If Putin wants to saber rattle his so called nukes as a shield to obliterate Ukraine in a way that might as well be nuclear in result, then what's the point? Simple warning. If you launch nukes, the world will remove Russia as a country from human existence. For now, NATO should be removing Russian from the Ukraine. Overtly. With overwhelming force. Instead, it's become a terrible case of envy temptation... we are rejoicing in their misery by our actions of gossping about it, writing stories about it, selling arms about it. We as a planet deserve what is coming. We have been warned, over and over and over.
Zelensky's comments came one day after the notorious Russian mercenary organization the Wagner Group successfully repelled Ukrainian counterattacks near Bakhmut, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
or send F16/F18's. Given that you'd need to train the pilots and mechanics then a plane that can do A2A, A2G and CAS would be a better option.
Absolutely. The US entered a quagmire there as well. Many former fascists were allowed to work in post-ww2 Germany, same for Japan. But in Iraq, the people who ran the army and administration were fired.
