Then I hope the government never turns tyrannical and needs us commoners sedated into complacency, because the media will cover it up and half the country will compel the other half into complying or face unemployment.
That's correct. The Federal government decided long before your childhood free of polio and mumps that there would be a single central vaccine injury fund for people actually injured by vaccines.
Cool. Hopefully I don't suffer any long-term negative effects from a vaccine for a virus that I wasn't at risk from anyway. If so, hopefully I'll qualify for reparations in a decade or so. Thanks for the quick answer.
Because it is legal for an employer, public or private, to mandate vaccination as a condition of employment, any lawsuit you file alleging unlawful termination of employment will be handily dismissed.
whats the duress? if its well an good then stop worrying about it and just go do it. if its "well and good" then calm down because its not a big deal. I dont even think you could properly define duress and actually apply it to what you are talking about here.
