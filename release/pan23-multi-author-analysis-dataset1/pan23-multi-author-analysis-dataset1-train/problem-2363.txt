Is there any evidence suggesting that the targets were selected from a scientific standpoint to allow scientists to study the full extent of each of the bombs capabilities? I’m experiencing some source amnesia here but I thought I learned from somewhere that one factor considered in the selection process was the ability to assess damage potential. Your response said that the targets were selected for their potential for psychological impact and were therefore protected from future firebombing campaigns. The targets had also minimal damage from prior bombing campaigns. This would likely mean that damage output of the bombs could be clearly measured on the ground because there would be little to no doubt what caused any damage post bomb. Any insight here would be appreciated. Thanks!
In the aftermath, the people who dropped the bomb created all sorts of justifications as to why they "had" to drop the bombs on these cities — the military base at Hiroshima, the war factories at Nagasaki — but these are after-the-fact justifications to make it seem a little less controversial. The reality is very clear from the planning meeting documents: they destroyed the cities because they thought such an action would make the most impact on the Japanese (and the rest of the world, including, importantly, the USSR), for better or worse.
