That certainly is a sound conclusion. When there is no change in the issue that was supposed to be addressed. They made a change that wasn't required since the issue persists, unchanged.
Otherwise to sue and win, you'd need to show they were negligent (ie misdiagnosed the car in a way an average mechanic would not have, or improperly repaired the car below the level of an average mechanic, or actually caused additional damage to the car during the repair) you would need to get an expert witness as part of a small claims lawsuit. This would be someone who has enough experience with car repairs (through training, work experience, or whatever) to convince the Court they're qualified to testify about the issue. They would need to examine your car and testify as to the causes in court. It's usually not economically viable for you to find someone like this for a $2,700 lawsuit, especially as you don't get the expert witness fees back if you win, unless you happen to have a friend/relative/etc with sufficient experience.
