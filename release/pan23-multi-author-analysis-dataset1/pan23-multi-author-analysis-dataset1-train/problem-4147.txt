We don’t know exactly how many would have dissented, but we do know enough would have dissented for it to not pass. We know this because there was a coalition of openly pro life Dems from conservative states in congress who wouldn’t vote for the ACA if it included any abortion protections or funding for abortion. Who wanted Hyde amendment guarantees in the actual wording of the legislation. The ACA almost didn’t pass because of them. You don’t remember Bart Stupak? Ben Nelson? The ‘Stupak bloc’??? We absolutely didn’t have the votes to codify Roe, and pretending otherwise is absolutely absurd! You either don’t actually know anything about the makeup of Congress during the Obama administration, or you are purposefully lying about it.

Seriously. Just because your pet issue wasn't fully accomplished doesn't mean you should stay home. Stop expecting instant results for everything and vote consistently.
