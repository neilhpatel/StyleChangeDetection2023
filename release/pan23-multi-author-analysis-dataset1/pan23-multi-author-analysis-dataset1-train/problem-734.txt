It's so fascinatingly odd to see up close, especially when it's well-intentioned. These people lie about everything. It truly is a compulsion. They can't help it. I had to work with a guy like this once. He was basically harmless but I had to just go along with a lot of his bullshit or he'd get real testy. After a while you learn to tune it out. At least my onetime co-worker wasn't narcissistic. He wanted validation but wouldn't manipulate you for it. He'd just lie and hope he impressed you and you would love him.

Seriously. Just let his shit play out, he’s under investigation. Stop jerking off to everything he’s ever said like it’s your big journalism break, none of this is news anymore.
Honestly, unlikely. He's a pretty classic compulsive liar with a side of narcissism. If you've never crossed paths with someone like this count yourself lucky. I've met a few in my life, and they're always ... memorable. I'm torn on the nature/nurture aspect of it.
