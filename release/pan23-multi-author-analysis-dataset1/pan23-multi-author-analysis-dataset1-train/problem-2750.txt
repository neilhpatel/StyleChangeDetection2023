Well, sort of. There are a lot of misconceptions about alfalfa. A lot of articles like to paint alfalfa as "water thirsty" and cite stats on water usage per acre per year. But what they fail to take into account is that in places with long growing seasons like AZ and CA, they're typically getting 8 to 10 cuts (harvests) per year. Alfalfa itself has a very deep taproot, over 20 feet in many cases, and is actually quite drought tolerant. It's just that with the right soil moisture it grows very quickly and you can maximize yield by irrigating.

Absolutely. I did a paper in grad school about California's water problem and yes, the almonds! I love them of course, but it's completely out of control here in CA. The cattle thing is another thing hard to attack. I reduced my meat intake by about 2/3 many years ago. I still get to eat plenty of meat. But some folks lose their mind at the thought of just reducing their meat consumption by a little.
