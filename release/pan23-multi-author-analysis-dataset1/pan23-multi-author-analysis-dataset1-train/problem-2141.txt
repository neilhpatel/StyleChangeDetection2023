No. No, she can't. Hobbs will win (barely!). I'm more interested now in whether Dems can eke out a tie in the AZ Senate (it's currently trending to status quo, 16R to 14D, but one race in particular is super close (depends on remaining Pinal vs Pima). Important for many reasons, including stopping any new, dumb "forensic audits," but I think that crazy R attorney general might win and would be harder for Hobbs and the new SoS to combat if Rs control both halves of the legislature.
Iâ€™m in Nevada. Have not seen that Lake lost yet. Last I heard many votes to be counted in Maricopa and not guaranteed they will swing Hobbs way. Source? I do hope she FUCKING CRATERS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER, however, as we successfully destroyed all MAGA election deniers here on the Silver State.
