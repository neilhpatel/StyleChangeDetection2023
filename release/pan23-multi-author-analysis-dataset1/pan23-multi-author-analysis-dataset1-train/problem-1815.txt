A month ago the former president illegally tries to dismiss the legislature while they were starting a third round of impeachment, gets ignored and the legislature succeeds on the third attempt, he tries to flee and gets stuck in traffic. He’s now in jail.
The congress is completely corrupt and very right leaning, they depose any president they disagree with by fabricating nonsense or using their power, and they use the military to threaten politicians and hunt political activists.
Legal? Yes, legit? Hard to say for sure as I’m only a bit more looped in than you are it sounds like but here’s what I know.
Given that immediately after Castillo assumed office the military and right leaning congress members harassed and threatened his cabinet and forced many to leave their office, blocked every piece of legislation proposed by Castillo and his party, and their natural aversion to his more progressive direction what with increased rights for workers and controls on corporations being a part if his plan; it is safe to say they impeached him because he was good for the people and bad for business.
