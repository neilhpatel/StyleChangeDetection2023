That's the paradoxical nature of emancipation. It's generally for child actors (whose parents allowed them to become child actors, generated massive income, and now was separation from parents) and sometimes foster children or the abused who find themselves essentially without parents, and they move in with friends and start working before emancipation.
Hi! Thanks so much. I do not rely on anyone for transportation. I have a license/my own car. I have the ability to rent my own place and buy my own food and to get a job but I cannot legally do that because I am not emancipated. I donâ€™t rely on anyone for money. My mother, or anyone else does not provide for me. I provide for myself based on the money I have saved up from working in the past as well as money that the court forced my father to lay to me in the past. I have enough money to survive off of for close to a year. I know a girl who had only $5000 saved up to get emancipated. I have 3 times that amount. There are a ton of employee shortages right now so it would be incredibly easy for me to get a job right now. However, I can not LEGALLY do so because I do not have permission and I am not emancipated. Would the court still over look that aspect?
