There was a prototype of basically 40mm grenade with 4 foldable copter wings and targeting/navigation stuff, around 20 cm when unfolded. Unit was supposed to cost like 1k euros when mass produces. Short range of course, but combine it with true swarm behaviour that's not too far in the future and autonomy, and it's abssolutely fucking terrifying. Imagine trying to shoot 20 of these things when they just swarm 50m above you and drop on you and each one of your mates personally. Man made horrors beyond our comprehension and all.
Ultimately a networked drone system would be used as reconnaissance to locate enemy positions (they're in the places where they keep destroying your drones, or where your drones just see them) and the actual fighting left to dedicated long ranged drones to fly in with INS before using conventional systems for terminal guidance. At best you'd have some machine vision for target acquisition but youd still want a human operator somewhere in there so your drones arent just blowing up cardboard cutouts of tanks or flying into human shaped bushes. When you need quick response you'd be better off with dedicated air to ground platforms paired with air superiority fighters.
Extremly effective. Not just in field tactics, but as a military strategy. Killing a soldier results in burial costs, wounding a soldier results in medical costs.
Not particularly effective though. Even if you crash it in a trench your only getting 1 or 2 casualties. The effect on moral will be rough, but so is just having a hand grenade fall out of the sky and land in your foxhole.
