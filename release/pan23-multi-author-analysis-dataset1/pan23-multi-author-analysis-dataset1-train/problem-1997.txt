European Muslims fought to keep the adhƒÅn in the late Middle Ages, even to the extent of changing the call. Some changes were major, some were minor, and some were a matter of life or death.
Any report collected in Sahih Bukhari hardly needed additional verification due to how stringent the conditions were to even be included in the collection in the first place, but these reporters and the people they were reporting on were all considered Scholars of that first Generation, with 'Ibn Umar being most well known for going to great lenhs that were unmatched by any other from that generation or since, to live by the Prophetic Traditions.
Recorded in Sahih Bukhari, which is held as the most authentic collection of Prophetic Traditions in Islam for over a millennia, we have 2 separate instances of a Mu'adhdin (The one who gives the call to prayer) soon after the passing of The Prophet each of which call back to this being an accepted practice by the Prophet in times of extreme need, though each of those instances themselves were in relation to extreme weather.
For a report to be included in Sahih Bukhari it had to be proven that the saying or reported action of the Prophet met with certain criteria such as there being an unbroken and known chain of narrators reaching back to that First Generation of Islam, that all narrators in that chain could have feasibly met with the one they were reporting from, that all of them had good reputations within their communities, that none of them were known to have weak memories, etc. The list of conditions is long and each report had to fulfill each and every condition to be included. There are other collections of authentic reports with less stringent conditions, but there is little debate regarding the contents of this collection.
