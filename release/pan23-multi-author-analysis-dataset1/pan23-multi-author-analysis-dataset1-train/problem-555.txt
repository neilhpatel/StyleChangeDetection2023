The only potential legal issue I could see here is if someone was unable to get vaccinated, or someone had to get vaccinated, because of a medical disability. If they were being treated differently (worse) based on their inability or need to receive the vaccine that stems from their medical disability, then it’s possible that this would count as discrimination based on a disability which could be illegal depending on the overall context here. Even then, however, more context could make it legal. For instance, if someone has a medical condition that makes it so they can’t get vaccinated, but someone else has a medical condition that makes it very dangerous to be around unvaccinated people, then separating vaccinated and unvaccinated people may be a reasonable accommodation for the second person there that does not infringe on the first person’s rights (since it’s about accommodating the second person, not discriminating against the first person).
How would that even work? 99.99% of discrimination is legal. It's impossible to have a society or businesses if discrimination was banned. We discriminate against people who are not team players, who have less experience, who are late to work, who don't sell enough products, who we don't like. And, yes, who haven't been vaccinated. Schoolkids are also discriminated against for lack of vaccinations.
P.S. - Notice all of the downvotes I received from people assuming I’m anti-vax or trying to be an asshole? Perhaps a bias does exist?
