I can really only speak to the case of Romania, but it's worth remembering that while the Communists certainly engaged in extensive political indoctrination, the people living under communism were acutely aware of its shortcomings. This was particularly true in Romania, where the economy had been in dire straits for most of the decade leading up to 1989 due to Ceausescu's ill-fated effort to erase Romania's national debt through exporting goods, and because of his austerity program, people were doing without basic consumer products like toilet paper (prompting a few hilarious, but unrepeatable jokes). Many people were going hungry, and Romania had the highest infant mortality rate in Europe at the time. So, in other words, people knew what they were being told was a lie, but they were scared into silence by the repressive apparatus of the state, the Securitate, which was the largest secret police force (relative to population) in the Eastern Bloc. Still, there had already been a few cases of unrest in major cities during the 1980s (most notably in Brasov in 1987) prior to the events of December 1989 that led to the overthrow of Ceausescu. The degree to which people were unhappy with Romanian communism was pretty well illustrated by the violence of the Romanian Revolution (it was the only country to violently overthrow its government and execute its leaders).
I think you misunderstand the early part of the 1990s. The masses did not want to go beyond socialism. I'll remind you how President Iliescu, who won 85% of the votes in the May 1990 elections, had accused Ceau»ôescu of "tarnishing the noble ideals of socialism".
