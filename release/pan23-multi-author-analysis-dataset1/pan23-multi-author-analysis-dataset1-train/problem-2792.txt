Finished reading Corpus Christi: The Eucharist in Late Medieval Culture, by Miri Rubin. Controversies surrounding the theology of the consecrated host in the 11th century produced bodies of work that seek to explain the mystery of the Eucharist. The development of new Eucharistic theology, in turn, created the need to communicate to the laity the significance of the Eucharist, and thus the liturgy became more elaborate as it greatly increased focus and veneration on the consecrated bread and wine.
Hi! Looking for suggestions on the syncretic practices associating political figures and religious ones, especially in late XIX and early XX Century "popular religion", as well as at folklore level (local narrations, anecdotes). More specifically, the informal inclusion of political figures, especially those associated with the concept of "martyrdom", within more traditional expressions: "cult of the saints", "cult of the dead".
3. Tobie Meyer-Fong's What Remains: Coming to Terms with Civil War in Nineteenth-Century China (2013) rounds it out by discussing the civilian experience of the Taiping War, and at its memory in the immediate postwar period. How did people (try to) avoid starvation? How did they deal with losing loved ones? How did they deal with all the dead bodies?
One non-academic fashion/royal/women's history book I know that's more widely available is Queen of Fashion: What Marie-Antoinette Wore to the French Revolution by Caroline Weber. The title is more about catching the eye; it's about her use of fashion and clothing throughout her life. This is an angle on the period that relatively few people have explored, and it's fascinating. Probably the best intro to 1770s-1780s fashion out there.
Not sure this quite fits, but Carl Kilcourse's Taiping Theology has some interesting discussion of how Hong Xiuquan's status was to be understood given his status as both political leader of the Heavenly Kingdom and as the incarnation of God's second son.
