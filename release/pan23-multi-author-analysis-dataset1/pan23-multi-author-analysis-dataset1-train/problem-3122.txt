Great Britian took over South africa from Netherlands after the 4th dutch-anglo war in 1784 and it was officially ceeded in 1806 because Napoleon annexed Netherlands. Dutch boeren started trekking up north in the 1810-30's and the more deadly conflicts between boeren, british, zulu's and other local people were in the second half of 19th century and just before WWI.
Btw I dont defend the main reason why boeren started trekking, them wanting slavery and not living among coloured people is vile and they continued that practice in their two shortlived states which made them stand alone in the world, even Netherlands didnt maintain trade or kept diplomacy with them in the boer wars. But they also left for lack of representation and because they were forced to speak only another language and they also suffered from the british in badly maintained concentration camps later on in the 2 boer wars.
Yup. Itâ€™s something I have seen elsewhere on this forum. It is referring to their use of Z - a non Cyrillic letter - and their strange sense of ownership (without any shame) of it as a facist symbol.
