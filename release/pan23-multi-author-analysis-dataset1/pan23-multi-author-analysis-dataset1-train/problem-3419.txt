That's what I figured, just wanted to make sure all bases are covered. We are buying new doors and looking into security systems today. We just moved into this house and figured we would be fine without. This was a lapse in judgment on our part, it will not happen again. Thank you!
If you or the district attorney decide to file charges against her, you should ask an attorney if it would be possible to ask the court to have her mental competency evaluated and also ask your attorney if a restraining order against her should be requested by you.
We found out a bit about her today. She's got an extensive record. We found out this is her 3rd burglary charge. The previous ones were 2nd&3rd degree. At this time, the DA has advised us that she is being charged with 1st degree burglary. We've spent the day considering that it may be better to just break our lease, if she keeps getting out there's no way to ensure she won't try it again. My children are traumatized and don't feel safe here. And yes, TCSO has let us know she was "highly intoxicated." She spoke clearly, and kept saying she used to come here as a child but the owners of the house have told us they have no clue who she was.
