The ones that have already happened have some great content to read, and we have a half-dozen still to come. This is especially timely to mention in a META thread like this, as it is always great to see lurkers come out of the woodwork and participate in the community even if they might normally not feel able to answer questions, because Floating Features are modded very lightly! We want to see contributions both bit and small.
Mods of the fearsome divine powers, clad in terror, riding on the great divine powers, Mods, made complete by the strenh of the holy ankar weapon, drenched in blood, rushing around in great battles, with shield resting on the ground, covered in storm and flood, great Mods, knowing well how to plan conflicts, you destroy mighty lands with arrow and strenh and overpower lands.^.
