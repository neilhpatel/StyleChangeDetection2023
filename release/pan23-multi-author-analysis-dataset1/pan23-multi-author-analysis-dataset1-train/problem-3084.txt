Can you think of another country that has invaded a smaller and weaker country, with flimsy and concocted evidence, then occupied it for decades, looted and stolen with stories of rape and other atrocities by its troops? What happened to that country after they invaded a weaker and smaller country? Were they demonized for decades, had sanctions placed on them, had military bases built by their adversaries on their borders, had the property of its citizens appropriated, had to face meddling in their and their neighbors internal affairs? Now get this, this very same country is at the supposed moral vanguard of fighting Russia. The mind boggles.
I know Russia, and Putin are demented, but If I were Biden/Zelenskky, I would have both make a very blunt video, explaining that there is no intention to attack Russia, and that the war is strictly defensive against a aggressor, make the message short and simple, and human.
Same thing happens when i go missing with the wasp nests. I’m hoping with enough fireworks this year they’ll learn to stop messing with me by just being there. Hopefully the neighbors don’t mind a little destruction to get them out.
