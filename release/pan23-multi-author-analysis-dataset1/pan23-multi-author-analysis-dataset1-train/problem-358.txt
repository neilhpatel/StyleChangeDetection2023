If your HOA is not maintaining the amenities, the best remedy you have is to participate in the HOA's political process. Talk to the board about it, get your neighbours to do the same, request and read over the financials to find out where the money is being spent, show up for annual and special general meetings with prepared talking points, or even run for the board yourself to try to move change forwards directly. If you have a group of owners with similar interests, political change is well within your reach and will almost certainly be both faster and more effective than litigation.
No. Read the governing documents. The arrangement is not you paying for a service to which you are owed. Your arrangement is that you are part of a group who pools their money together and choose volunteers from within to use those funds for the purposes outlined in your governing documents. The group that you refer to (breach on their part) encompasses you and all of your fellow homeowners. You are as much at fault for the maintenance concerns as every other homeowner, including your Board members.
