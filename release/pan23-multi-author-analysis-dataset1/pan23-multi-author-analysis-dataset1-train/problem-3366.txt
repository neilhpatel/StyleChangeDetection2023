That is a poster pose. I hope he makes it through this. The way he went back knowing he would be locked up told me, and I know nothing about the politics of Russia, - it told me that he has real courage. Putin poses on a horse.
Denying visits from loved ones for over a year, along with contaminated medication causing a painful infection and weight loss, highlights the disturbing inhumane conditions in Russian prisons.
I wonder though. He did try to kill him with Novichok. After that Navalny and Bellingcat exposed the plot and I think he made that YouTube video before return. So if he was killed right upon re entry or second attempt, this could have triggered a revolt, who knows. Him being alive keeps opposition nice and hopeful (i.e. yes very much martyr situation just more nuanced I think because first attempt failed). Just theorizing.
Oh no. I stand corrected on my opinion. Dumb of me to assume that just because heâ€™s anti-Putin that he is a decent human. That makes me kind of sad actually.
