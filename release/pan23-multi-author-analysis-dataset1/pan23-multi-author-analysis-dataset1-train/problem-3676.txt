Have you reported to your card companies that your card number has been stolen/compromised? You should do that. In addition, you should treat this like identity theft (which it is) and follow the guide to lock down everything else and make sure there aren't other things lurking that you don't know about (like additional lines of credit or loans in your name).
In tears now. Thank you for your kind words. He literally has no resources and is supposed to be working on bankruptcy. CoVid has made this extra hard because his computer is the way he stays in touch with his friends. He's lost all sense of spirituality, has no income, won't go back to school, had his car reposessed so has no transportation other than the Mom and Dad Chauffeur Service. We have trouble even getting him out of his basement cubby to get some fresh air and exercise. Again, thanks.
To add to the existing advice, if you do decide to kick him out in the future, be sure that you follow your state's procedures for ending a tenancy, and if he fails to move out after that, then your state's eviction/summary ejectment process through the court. Don't just dump stuff out on the street and change the locks.
