For those who are unable to read Finnish, Marin said that the talks about sending heavy military equipment are progressing and that the general support is increasingly shifting towards providing heavy weaponry for Ukraine.

Totally different war. That’s like saying because we can’t wipe the rot off and apple, we can’t wipe the dust off it. In Afghanistan we were fighting a pointless war against a frequently invisible enemy. It was hard to know who was friend and who was for until they started shooting. It was also a war that wasn’t really able to be won because you can’t defeat ideology. Russia on the other hand will be people, in uniforms, on a battlefield, and it’s also the _exact_ war our military has spent decades and decades preparing for, training for, building technology designed exactly to defeat.
