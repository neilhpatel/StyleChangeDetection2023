We tend to think of "Classical" Latin - the Latin epitomized by the speeches of Cicero and the poetry of the Augustans - as standard Latin. In reality, nobody ever spoke Classical Latin. Classical Latin was an artificial, literary dialect, founded on the speech of educated Romans in the capital, but never identical to it. All spoken Latin was "Vulgar" Latin, informed by its literary cousin to a greater or lesser extent, depending on one's education.
Oh definitely! Of cause this is not always the case, but it is a good guideline. Just look at Sanskrit as well.
Now, it's true that as time passed the spoken vernacular evolved significantly, but once again there is pretty much no evidence that speakers perceived there to be two separate linguistic systems, as opposed to a continuum of register just like we have in any modern language, with anywhere on that continuum being possible in speech, but only the upper end of that continuum being possible in writing. This is fundamentally different from something like Arabic, where, while its true that there is a continuum of MSA influenced vernacular speech, there is also a perception that MSA and the modern vernacular dialects are separate entities.
