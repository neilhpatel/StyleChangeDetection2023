Her best option, if the Buyer is not willing to cancel the contract is to have a lawyer (her own, not the real estate companyâ€™s) review the documents and tell her what her exposure is. The attorney could give her advice on moving forward, whether that is the contingency still stands and she can cancel with no worries, or she waived the contingency and her options from there (like offering to pay the guy some extra money to go away).
Your mother is confused. Not only will it help, it's exactly what she wants. Voiding the contract cancels the sale of the house from your mother to the buyer. That would allow your mom to remain in the house and prevent her from being sued. It wouldn't cost her anything.
The other alternative is to inform your mothers agent that she will not move, if there is litigation her realtor will pay for any and all litigation costs and ultimate damages to her should she lose the case since they're admitting they made the mistake.
An even better idea is to tell your mother's agent that she needs an attorney right now and that they're going to pay all the attorneys fees she needs to pay in order to get the best representation she can obtain in this matter.
If your mother is at risk of being sued and she can't afford to hire an attorney for advice, then you and your brothers could kick in some cash so that she can obtain representation.
