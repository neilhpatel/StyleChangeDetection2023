So long as the children live, and continue to live, in Oregon, no one could file anywhere but an Oregon court to resolve or try to gain any visitation or other custody rights concerning a minor child, and Oregon law would govern any case filed.
You should appropriately be guided to talk to an Oregon attorney who would tell you what the possibilities for any third party to seek visitation or contact rights with your minor children under Oregon law, which is the only law which can apply to your children so long as their home state is Oregon.
For your peace of mind, what you are initially going to hear from an Idaho attorney is that Idaho has no ability to enforce its laws upon any issue concerning custody or visitation for your children so long as the children's home state is Oregon under the UCCJEA, which is determined by where the children have lived for the last 6 months.
Thank you for your kind words. No one else seems to see my mom the way I do and I constantly second guess if I'm doing the right thing.
