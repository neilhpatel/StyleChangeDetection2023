If they truly had evidence, they would have arrested you. If they come back, you can ask them through the door if they have a warrant. If they say no, let them know you will not answer questions without an attorney present. If they do have a warrant, ask them to show you through a window so that you can read it. It seems unlikely that there is sufficient evidence (or any evidence, for that matter) to issue a warrant. But on the off chance there is, you should still refuse to answer any questions without an attorney present. They will try to pressure you to talk, and they will twist your words to make you look guilty. Silence, however, cannot be used against you.
Probably most of the cases people can talk themselves out of getting arrested is when they have hard evidence like they were at a certain place and the time of the alleged crime like video surveillance or enough people who can vouch you being at certain place and certain time anything much less than that they probably almost always dig themselves in a deeper hole talking to the police. Especially if someone has already named you as a suspect.
