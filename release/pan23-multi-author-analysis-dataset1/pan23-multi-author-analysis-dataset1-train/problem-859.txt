"It is not accurate or appropriate to make generalizations about people who commit violent crimes based on their religious background. It is also not possible to determine the percentage of people who kill police officers with a religious background, as this information is not widely available and would be difficult to accurately track.
Violent crime, including the killing of police officers, is a complex issue with many potential contributing factors, and it would be inappropriate to attribute it to any single factor such as religion. It is important to focus on the individual circumstances and motivations behind each act of violence, rather than making broad assumptions based on religious or other demographic factors.".
Because I’m super fascinated w religious extremism/fundamentalism and how various societies have dealt with it across religions and eras - and yeah, carving out a kind of social silo for folks who are way, way out there seems to be the most successful model, no matter how unpalatable it may appear to the rest of society.
Yeah okay, but they were under no threat at all. Not from Ukraine or the West. So why were they so scared? They started this war and they refuse to leave Ukraine. This war is 100% the fault of Russia.
I’m not convinced it’s the right call, but have definitely been entertaining thoughts along those lines - it’s such a delicate balance between “containing” truly extreme ideologies vs having some kind of pressure release outlet to minimized explosions.
Dude. I grew up in Lebanon. Where su you think the militia leaders go? Church, mosque etc.. That's religion and religious war. Do you actually think it's different because we live in the west now?
