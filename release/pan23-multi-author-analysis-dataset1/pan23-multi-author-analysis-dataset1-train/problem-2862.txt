I don't think that Russia is going to be a paradise after the war but I would not use the word "always" here. I do have some hope that things might turn out attleast slightly better.
The article clearly states that the number is “up to” and a combination of Russian military and contractors like the Wagner group with the Wagner group having as high as a 50% casualty rate.
Thank you. Some news media sources were projecting a very grave outcome for Ukraine for this latest massive Russian assault. I feel like I am holding on for them as if they are my own children.
But through a combination of luck, Russian miscalculations, Russian corruption, the sheer force of will of the Ukrainian people, and the massive balls hanging between Zelensky's legs, they were thwarted in the first first few days and the West had time to organise and more importantly, Ukraine still had a functioning government to which we could send supplies.
I don't think so... Even returning to pre war borders would be a disaster for him. The more men he loses the more he needs to gain from this war.
