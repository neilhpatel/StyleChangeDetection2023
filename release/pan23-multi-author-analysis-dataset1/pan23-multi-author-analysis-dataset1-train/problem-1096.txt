I'm gonna let you in on an open secret about the early Middle Ages. We dont know anything about the beliefs of the Norse. We cannot name a single tenet/doctrine/guideline for their religious tradition with any real certainty. This is because we count the number of contemporary descriptions of Norse religion that were written down by practitioners on no hands. They simply dont exist. Every single source we have on "Norse mythology" is either a later creation, written after conversion to Christianity, or was written by Christians, almost invariably with no actual first hand knowledge. Trying to base an understanding of their beliefs about the afterlife, cosmology, and so on without primary sources is a little difficult as you might imagine!
N.B.: when I say, 'we don't know', there are of course a myriad of, more or less well grounded, theories, connecting them to later information and what little Tacitus, Caesar or Lucan, among others, give us, or offering interpretations based on names and iconography, but no hard information in the form of concrete mythological texts. And that is without getting into the can of worms that is distinguishing between 'Celtic' and 'Germanic'.
Really? I had thought that Norse religion persisted today. The National Museum of Denmark says "Today there are between 500 and 1000 people in Denmark who believe in the old Nordic religion and worship its ancient gods." Certainly a very small population but it will depend upon whether there has been an unbroken chain of handover of oral history. I was under the impression that the Norse religion had a larger following in Iceland.
