So Bradleys and Leopards arrived. Ukrainian Defense minister climbing out of one and asking politely where the road to Moscow is. Time to go home, Russia.
Almost as if they have a networked system where counter artillery radar can directly digitally transmit the Excalibur artillery round programming solution directly to a group of motorized artillery units which operate in unison with one moving, one on standby and one reloading meaning they can always have one gun ready to fire. Seeing as the radar can pick up arty rounds quite early in their flight and fire solution is transferred digitally and the round programmed automatically one should be able to fire off a GPS precision guided round back towards an enemy artillery position before the enemy artillery round has even struck its intended target.
A third of Africa already speaks English. They’re way closer to Europe and N America. And we can’t offer better deals than China?
Since yesterday on twitter I'm seeing a lot of activity among Russian apologists aimed at diminishing the scale of the war, with plenty of commenters (a Fox "journalist" included) posting what is possibly the dumbest take since the start of the war: "something is fishy, we are not seeing any footage from this war, I've seen more of WWII". Lol.
Almost as if they are conceptually designed to operate as one integrate automated system create in one country and all share naming related to old British stories about archers, kings and swords...
Yep. If you want to be mad at somebody about China investing in Africa, it should be us, that we’re not even trying to out-compete the Chinese there.
