If Orban makes objections now to please Moscow, he antagonizes the bloc he depends on. If he approves Finland/Sweden now only for Turkey to block them, he has just antagonized Moscow for absolutely no gain. Could be that he never has to make that decision at all if he just waits.
Also Finland provides a massive shield to Sweden, and with the NATO integration and potential additional troop stationing, removes the historical Russian invasion threat to Finland for good.
Are you nuts? You CLEARLY don’t understand the firepower of the US Navy… One… ONE Aircraft carrier could destroy the entire Turkish military in an afternoon… (That’s not much of an exaggeration. US built Turkey’s systems and knows every detail and location. one F 22 on a pre-programmed route could destroy MOST of their missiles and bases a week before the ship arrives…).
Not necessarily. If Finland joins without Sweden it'd complicate defense cooperation, as one would be in NATO and the other wouldn't. Like Finland often says, Sweden is its closest defense partner.
