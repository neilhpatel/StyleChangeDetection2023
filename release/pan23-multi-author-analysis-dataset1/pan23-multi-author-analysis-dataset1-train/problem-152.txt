In early 1945, a delegation of seven Indian scientists visited the United States as part of a cross-cultural exchange program with its allies. One of the things they asked to see while there was where the US was enriching its uranium. This made the Manhattan Project security people lose their mind, and they interrogated them; the Indians claimed they had just deduced that the US must be doing this. They promised to keep their mouths shut. There are more details on this very interesting event in my forthcoming book on nuclear secrecy; it is not published anywhere else. ).
A fun fact I read recently was that the British government lost their copy of the agreement to merge Tube Alloys (British nuclear project) into the Manhattan Project and therefore couldn’t prove to Truman that they were entitled to joint ownership of the scientific secrets. They had to start again from scratch. A copy of the agreement later showed up in a retiring admiral’s papers because some clerk thought Tube Alloys sounded vaguely naval and filed it there.
