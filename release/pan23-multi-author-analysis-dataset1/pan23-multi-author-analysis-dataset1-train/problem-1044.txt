This is a mess and you would be smart to consult with a tenant rights group or an attorney. But the HOA has nothing to do with you. If you have a lease, your landlord has to honor your lease. You cannot be removed in 48 hours. You can negotiate with your landlord to pay you for your inconvenience, and you will move out once you have been paid and agreed to move out. Anything with the HOA is between your landlord and the HOA. They have no power over you.
Your landlord does not have a leg to stand on, they need to give you all of your deposit upfront before you even contemplate moving- do not start moving out without funds in hand and if she gives you a check wait 10 days to make sure those funds are good- I would ask for cashiers check- if she scoffs- keep living there until she pays- if she threatens eviction she will be run through the fire by a judge when he hears all the facts.
This is not your problem. This is your landlord's problem. She agreed to provide you with housing. She violated HOA rules, not you. She needs to make you leaving worth your while.
Generally yes. It depends on what is written in the CC&Rs. Incidentally, I have reviewed thousands of HOA docs and have never seen an outright prohibition in tenants. Usually, if there is a restriction, the HOA has the ability to screen the tenants and / or approve the lease.
