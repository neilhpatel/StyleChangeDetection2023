Ugh, as a woman raised by Mormons in Utah there was so much of this. Like we were magically expected to be able to do so much stuff but weren’t allowed to learn how to make it happen, and even showing that it took any effort as super stigmatized. For instance, we were supposed to look extremely perfect all the time but it was supposed to be natural and effortless, everyone wore a full face of makeup but tried to make it seem like they didn’t use any products at all. Lots of women wore makeup in their sleep so their husbands wouldn’t know that wasn’t what they actually looked like, and most girls avoided things like camping and swimming because the makeup would come off, but then we were criticized for being “such princesses” like we were doing it for fun, but then if anyone’s makeup came off and someone saw a zit the girl would be horribly bullied and often even punished by her parents.
