This link should help you answer your questions, but if I'm understanding this correctly, you want to know what you are due if you volunteer OT. According to CA Labor Laws, you are due double time on the 7th consecutive day. So you are no longer a time and a half OT rate, but rather double time on your 7th day, 8th day, 9th day and so forth unless you are an exempt employee. Hence why companies should give you a day off after 6 consecutive days, because they are getting charged 2:1 in labor for your work. And this is also unhealthy as well as not safe in the workforce. I hope this helps.
In , the CA Supreme Court found that not only could you end up working 12 days straight (Week 1: day off Sunday, Monday to Saturday, week 2: work from Sunday-Friday, Saturday off), but that should circumstances cause you to work all 7 days in a workweek, they would have to make it up within the calendar month.
You absolutely can. Some in the medical world choose to do this. Medical world is usually bi-weekly pay periods, beginning on a Sunday and ending Saturday of the following week. Many medical workers have 12-hour shifts.
>The provisions of Labor Code Sections 551 and 552 regarding one (1) day's rest in seven (7) shall not be construed to prevent an accumulation of days of rest when the nature of the employment reasonably requires the employee to work seven (7) or more consecutive days; provided, however, that in each calendar month, the employee shall receive the equivalent of one (1) day's rest in seven (7).
