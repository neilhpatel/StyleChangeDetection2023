Was there a culturally universal symbol for pubs? So that even though I'm a Yorkshireman in Kent I can say "Oh, there is a place I can grab a pint!", kind of like the three linked balls iconography for pawn shops? Or were pubs the only place you would ever see with a name like this, for example would butchers not have special names, only pubs, so if you saw a swan or three moons you knew it had to be a pub? Hope that is clear.
I've noticed some general confusion on this thread regarding the difference between personal arms, corporate arms and how they pertain to livery corporations which, while not being a strictly heraldic matter, is nevertheless helpful in order to clarify why there are pubs named after occupations rather than people. But let's first start with how arms are "made".
My point is it seems odd that pubs would cater to a certain group by reference to the guild since for the majority of the country it was not a local influence (the vast majority of guilds/livery's being in London and a few select other cities and the overall naming scheme is very widespread) and with minimal benefit, since they would not be using the ornate official heraldry of that guild for the sign, as the fashion seemed to be simple motifs or industry-related references (wheatsheaf, fleece, bell, hammer etc) partially due for ease of reproduction or appealing to all literacy levels.
Thank you for this interesting answer! I work in the pub business in the UK and am very interested in the history of pubs and their names - do you have any recommendations for further reading on this matter?
