Where West's visual aesthetic was a part of her attraction as an icon, Garland's aesthetic aspect was her voice, which was (and is in recordings) very expressive and emotional, and has a very distinctive sound that cannot be mistaken for any other singer. And of course, the movie that introduced her as a leading actress, The Wizard of Oz (1939), both has the potential for camp - as well as actual camp in Burt Lahr's performance as the Cowardly Lion - and easily recognizable parody, and relates to the public/private divide discussed above, with the black-and-white Kansas representing the outer world where gay men had to present a heterosexual image and the magical, technicolor Oz representing the gay scene. ("Friend of Dorothy" is for this reason an old-school euphemism for a gay man.).
I'll definitely try to check more of her works & the other references you cited as well I'm not a lot knowledgeable with XXth century USA and especially not the film industry so I'll keep my eyes open and learn diligently Thanks a lot again.
