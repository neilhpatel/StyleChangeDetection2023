Yep. Biden and Harris had a chance to take a step towards actual police reform and instead we got a watered down executive order and them wanting to reward law enforcement with even more funding while asking for no legitimate change in return.
Or just millions of boomers dying of old age each year. Some generational stuff is bullshit, but once Millenials are solidly in the majority of likely voters things will change substantially. AOC will be the center, not the left. It's one reason the right is panicking. And by the right, I include DINOs who want to increase cop funding, defense budgets, and refuse to consider M4A or $15 min. wage.
This is an ongoing battle, and the inevitable removal of boomers from the voting population will likely mean a new generation of wealthy older people who control our government for their own interests in the same way it is today.
Thoughts and prayers are nice. But talk is cheap. We want real reform. At this point it's a matter of public safety and ignoring it is just negligence. And it's pissing me off. Hollow words and half assed actions are fucking insulting.
