You’ve gotten a lot of good advice, the only tip I didn’t notice was that you can ask your doctor for medical records as proof of identity for a social security card. Hth.
Edit: many US government institutions will accept Associated Student Body (ASB) cards or a high school yearbook as “picture identification” when no other options exists and the picture is recent (within a few years).
I've been here before. You can go on the SSA website and get a Social Security card mailed to you without showing proof. If you have a photo ID (school) you can generally use that plus social security card to get a license. You might be able to go on to your state's vital records website and order a copy of your birth certificate too. Good luck!
If you have previously worked before, your W-2 (tax form) will have your full social security number and can usually be used as an official document for social security verification. Birth certificate requirements will vary by state, usually an ID, a check, and a trip to the county clerk will be enough.
