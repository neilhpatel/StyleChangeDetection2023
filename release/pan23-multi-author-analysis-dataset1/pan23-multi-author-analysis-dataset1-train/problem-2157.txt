I know a lot of folks that Identify as Iranian simply because their culture is still distinct from Persian. Some cultures are precursors that had lived in the region prior to the Achaemenid. Persian kings of antiquity have been known to bring artisans and scholars of other cultures, settling their people within classical Persia. For example, Assyrians are a minority group in Iran, but they have a fantastically long history in the region going back to 2500BC. The Sasanian Dynasty brought Armenian craftsman to Persia after the conquest of Armenia. Likewise, Persian Jews have been in Iran since the Babylonians.
I've known a lot of Persian folks, and they describe it pretty simply: If it's cultural, it's likely Persian. If it's national. Then it's probably Iranian. If it's older than that, it's something else.
Andrew Tate thought Muslim leadership was better, I'm sure, because of its tendency to brutally oppress women, marry them off to rapists at very young ages, forbid their education, and most of all, allow mediocre men like him to occupy positions of complete physical, sexual and intellectual dominance in the home and pretend they're actually worth respecting.
