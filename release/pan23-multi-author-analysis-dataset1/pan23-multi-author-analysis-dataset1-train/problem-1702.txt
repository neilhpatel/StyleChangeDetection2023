This is what the EU is saying: The "new Russian territories" are Ukrainian land, so Russian authorities doing anything "official" there don't have any more authority, in the eyes of the EU, than a random dude claiming his house is a country. A passport expedited by Russia in Kherson, according to the EU, hasn't been expedited by a competent authority of the city, so for all they care it's a forged one.
Ok. So Ukrainians live in this country called Ukraine. They got attacked by this power crazed fuck called Putin who controls Russia. Putin being a nut job that he is annexed parts of the country with a fake vote. Because Russia is well known for killing fleeing people of any side. As well as known for killing entire villages. Many people would think it wise to stay where they are and hope that Ukraine can take it back. If they need to leave the country for whatever reason they need a passport. Only offices in Russian controlled parts issuing passports are issuing Russian ones because Russia pretending itâ€˜s Russia now. So Ukrainians who need a passport will be told to go fuck themselves if they try and use the only passport they can currently get through no fault of their own. They are not at fault for Putin being a madman.
