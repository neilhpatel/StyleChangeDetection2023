It's also racial as well. I've noticed many leftists automatically side with groups that are non white in scenarios like this. They basically project issues endemic to the us onto other cultures and don't have the capacity for nuance and the complexity of these issues across the world. They see race first in the context of us politics and history, and everything else second or never.
I went to their arabic version website and while i couldn't find an arabic article on this incident, i found many articles talking and praising other terrorists dead/alive, mentioning the number of israelis they killed in an achievement flavor (kinda like their own Forbes 30 under 30), for example the 13 year old that shot at 5 civilians (two were off duty soldiers in civilian clothing that managed to retaliate) and died, as a hero and a success story, and not even the slightest sad that a child has succumbed to such acts. I've seen another one on an adult terrorist that killed 7 israelis ( i think it was the synagogue massacre a day before) with the same wording praising him.
