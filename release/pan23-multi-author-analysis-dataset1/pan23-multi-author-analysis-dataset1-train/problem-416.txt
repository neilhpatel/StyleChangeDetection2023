The thing is, among the pro-forced-birthers, the stereotype of the woman who seeks an abortion is a liberal (blue-haired, maybe), promiscuous, party-girl who has sex with abandon, countless strangers and without protection. You'll see plenty comments - even on Reddit - about how abortion is not meant to be birth control, about how abortion is not needed if one uses birth control, about how women get free abortions to avoid paying for birth control pills, about how there is no difference between third trimester abortion and infanticide, etc.
Me too and I’m in MN. But I am not taking the risk of bringing an innocent girl into a world where she doesn’t have rights and taking the risk that I don’t survive a complication and my existing boys end up motherless. The whole thing is so fucked.
And just like everything else socially and economically, they’ve either taken it completely for granted, and/or they’re perfectly fine pulling up the ladder behind them, screwing over subsequent generations.
What do you mean next? I'm pretty sure that one of the side effects of the Hobby Lobby case is that anyone who works there can't get government assistance for the marketplace, but also can't get birth control via the company insurance.
