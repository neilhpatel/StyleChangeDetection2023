If they made them all go to Javelins, it also affords crossloading of Dismounts vs Mounted, which is a very useful tool if there is more engagement under a specific condition....
You are cute, friend. Maybe do some reading before you stick your foot in your mouth for all to see.
High density, self-sharpening, and inherently incendiary, DU is just the perfect penetrator. Shame about the toxicity though.
Basically right, the turbine on the Abrams has a true idle mode that sips fuel and only generates enough power for onboard electronics, but it takes a LONG time to spin back up to operational mode (like, a minute+), so if there is even a tiny chance they might need to suddenly move they sit at "combat idle", which yep, uses nearly as much fuel as driving.
I wish they replaced the TOW system with Javelins. The bracketing is helpful as dismounts as a mechanism for range estimation. With a M2 it has those ranges already, so i would much rather a Javelin to do Fire and Forget, so the m2 can get back into defilade or start moving to its next position.
