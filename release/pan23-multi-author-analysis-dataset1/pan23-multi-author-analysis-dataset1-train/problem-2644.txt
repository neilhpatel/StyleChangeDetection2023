I would quibble a bit with the statistics you’re providing on Union membership although you’re correct to point out the South was not as heavily unionized as the North or Midwest, “still deeply unionized” was meant to compare the situation to today, not to compare the South to other regions of the country at the time. In Alabama, for example, AFL-CIO membership dropped from 185,000 in 1960 to roughly 54,000 in 1965. So if 20% of workers were unionized in Alabama in 1964 that number would have been at least 40% in 1960. Union membership peaked 1955-1958 in the United States and in 1960 AFL-CIO membership in Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Louisiana, and Georgia was still relatively high per the December 1961 issue of Monthly Labor Review.
This is dubious at best, as can be seen . West Virginia did have higher than the national average membership, but most of the South was not, had not, and to this day has never been strongly unionized. The reasons for this are another question in and of themselves, but it is fundamentally incorrect to say that the South (outside of parts of coal country) was ever unionized.
