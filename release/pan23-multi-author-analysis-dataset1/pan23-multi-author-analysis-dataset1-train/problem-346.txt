I know this is a hot take on this board but the debate around BBB was one of the dumbest fucking things I've ever witnessed in my life from the progressive side, to put it all on Manchin and Sinema is failing to hold our reps accountable. Manchin was ready to vote for a $1.8T infrastructure bill when the progressive caucus couldn't make a goddamn decision about which policy priorities would survive and instead decided they were going to try weird reconciliation bullshit and pushing messaging around "human infrastructure" so they didn't have to make a hard choice. it the literal exact same thing that tanked gun control and immigration reform from the freedom caucus, when you get to the end you have to make a compromise that's just how negotiating legislation works.

Given that Thomas will only croak in 5 years at the earliest, but quite possibly in 15, considering how long RBG lived after suffering 3 cancers (unless Republican becomes president till then), I hope that Biden sticks to nominating fresh blood in late 30s/early 40s of modest origin for the next 2-6 years to have ideal young, but qualified trailblazer to replace these sons of whores.
