2. Depending on the province there is a very long to indefinite statute of limitations for sexual crimes in Canada. Because of this and wording of your comments the crime was allegedly committed in Canada. You should at the very least consult with a criminal Defense attorney in the appropriate province. If you believe there is the potential that you will be approached by local police then you should get a criminal Defense attorney for Rhode Island, you may also want to make a list of potential attorneys who deal with extradition as well.
No one can answer that. I'd think it would be less than likely given that the alleged abuse happened so long ago and there's likely no corroborrating evidence. Also, the expense and effort of extraditing someone from another country may give the Canadian law enforcement additional pause if they do not believe they have a strong case.
No. I spoke with the parents. They said the cliche, "with time and love, everything can heal," "I see you as my own son.".
Potentially, yes. Since you live in the US, if Canadian authorities want to charge you with a crime, they need to request extradition from the US. That would happen in US courts. You would want an attorney to represent you for that if it gets to that point.
