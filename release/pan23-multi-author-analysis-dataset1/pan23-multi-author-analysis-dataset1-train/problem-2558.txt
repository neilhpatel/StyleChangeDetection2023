Very interesting read thank you, what i would really like to know is how by the 1930s did over 98% of american families drink coffee? That’s an incredible amount, especially when coffee isn’t necessarily a staple foodstuff, and during a time of economic hardship I know about the boston tea party, but surely this isn’t the only reason. Hopefully i get a reply.
I know speculation is frowned upon in this subreddit but I’ll end with a bit on the American side (and will remove if asked): given the timing, I could see tea having a lagging growth in imports to America throughout the 18th century, but in the wake of the Revolution, which would have occurred only 50-60 years after the popularity surge in England, it’s easy to imagine a cultural rejection of tea, along with an economic rejection due to the lack of connection with the East Indian Tea Company.
Unflaired users can refer to past questions and even answer questions. A flair just shows that you have written several good answers and are knowledgeable in a specific area, so flaired users can be expected to be able to successfully answer questions in their areas. But being flaired is not needed to answer questions, and it does not mean that flaired users' answers are above scrutiny. Case in point, I'm flaired but I have had an answer removed. However, when linking to other answers, be them from flairs or not, mods usually ask to include the username of the person who answered the question. In this case it's /u/The_Alaskan. This not only shows appreciation for their past contributions, but also allows them to answer any follow up questions or any concerns about their answers.
