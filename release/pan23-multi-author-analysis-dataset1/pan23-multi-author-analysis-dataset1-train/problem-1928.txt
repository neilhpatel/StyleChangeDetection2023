A famous quote is Major General Hägglund's question, "Will Kollaa hold? (Kestääkö Kollaa?)", to which Lieutenant Aarne Juutilainen (bit of a legend himself) replied, "Kollaa will hold (Kollaa kestää), unless the orders are to run away." The simple question and reply have entered Finnish lexicon as an expression of perseverance and resolve in the face of impending difficulty or crisis.
It's theater. Putin bad, yes. Zelensky bad, yes. It's not just a black and white scenario of good vs evil. They're both evil.
"ISW continues to assess that Ukraine’s decision to defend Bakhmut is a strategically sound effort to pin Russian forces in a discrete area of the front and attrit them, and Zelensky likely tempered his administration’s stance on Bakhmut to make a limited rhetorical concession to US officials.[6] It has long been clear that Ukraine would not continue to defend Bakhmut at the risk of seeing large numbers of Ukrainian troops encircled in the city, so Zelensky’s comment is not likely a real change in Kyiv’s strategy.".
Make sure all civilians are all evacuated then hide tons of explosives throughout the city and especially in buildings that are still standing or that could be important for Russian command before retreating then detonate all the explosives when it is confirmed that the Russians have taken Bakhmut.
