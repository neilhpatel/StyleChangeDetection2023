One possible way for it to be a scam is someone emails you in a few days saying they accidentally sent the money into your account, and begs you to transfer it back to their account (possibly promising to let you keep some as a show of gratitude), and then the original transfer is reversed because it came from a stolen credit card/account or some kind of fake source.
There are a few reasons why a criminal might do that. Transferring around illicit money can be complicated, especially if you're trying to convert it to cash. If they gain access to someones bank account they can't simply transfer money into their own account, they would get busted.
- Its possible the money is stolen from another account and they stashed it in yours because they have access to it and planned to transfer it out before you noticed. This is risky but scammers are used to a certain amount of "shrinkage" from these sort of scams.
- it could be part of a check/refund scam. Similar to above sometimes scammers will send money in a form that doesnt actually clear immediately like a check. Then they ask you to give them the cash back "keeping some for your trouble". Later it turns out the transaction was bad or fraudulent and gets reversed and you are out the money.
