> In New Jersey, most residential tenants are not required to move out at the end of the lease term, whether it is a month to month or a longer term lease. Under New Jersey law, most residential tenants have an ongoing right to continue renting a property until there is “good cause” to terminate the tenancy. These “good cause” grounds for eviction are specified in N.J.S.A. 2A:18-16.1, and, of course, include nonpayment of rent among other common sense causes, such as continuing to disregard material lease terms or causing excessive damage to the residence after proper notice. N.J.S.A. 2A:18-61.1(l)(3), allows the owner of a residence with 3 or fewer residential units to terminate a tenant’s lease where the owner seeks to personally occupy the unit, or where the owner has contracted to sell the unit to a buyer who seeks to personally occupy the unit, and the contract for sale calls for the unit to be vacant at the time of closing.
