While true, the media et all where lambasting trump for knowingly storing documents in an unsecured location. Where’s the Biden criticism for the same exact issue regarding the mishandling of these documents?
Biden’s team is searching for the docs and returning them doesn’t (in my POV) exonerate Biden from wrong doing, regarding the storage of such material .
Ha, no way. I have boxes in my garage of crap from when I was a child, that my parents made me take when they moved out of my childhood home, and boxes of papers and notebooks from college and grad school. I'll sort through them one day. And I'm not old. Have you ever helped an old person move out of their home into an apartment or elder care facility (or gone though and old relative's estate after their death)? 70+ years of accumulated family stuff plus 50+ years of accumulated senate office stuff, no one could be reasonably expected to know everything that's in there.
