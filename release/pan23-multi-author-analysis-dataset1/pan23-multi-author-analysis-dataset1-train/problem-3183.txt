It sure what you mean by ‚Äúlegal right‚Äù, they are not citizens, unless you are referring to the asylum process. They have the legal right if they are seeking asylum, which there is a different process for that doesn‚Äôt involve crossing the border illegally. Most illegal immigrants nowadays do not come from Mexico, but South America, and many (and probably the vast vast majority) are not actually fleeing for their lives but rather for economic opportunity. Seems reasonable to not bring them over the border, give them a court date, and release them into the interior of the country they were trying to illegally enter and hope they show up for their court date.
My side?? They both suck. No way I‚Äôm going to vote for anyone in the üí© show of USA politics. How closed minded are you? Not everything is black and white‚Ä¶ your side sucks and the right side sucks.. same damn bird, different wings.
I‚Äôm curious what you think of these studies [1] which indicated that immigrants during periods of laxer immigration policies actually returned back to their homes at a higher rate (1 in 3) AND in doing so brought higher wages and more capacity to ‚Äúimprove the situation in their home countries‚Äù that anti immigration pundits typically suggest as solutions.
