You should complete the putative father form in the state where she lives. They can’t put baby up for adoption without your agreement. It helps get you on the birth certificate if that’s what you want. If you want the baby, it might be difficult for DCFS to let you do so right away, because you’d be taking it so far from its mom. I would contact DSS near you and get a home study completed.
The issue with not simply handing the baby over has less to do with an unmarried father being "unsuitable" (the vast majority of unmarried mothers get to take their baby's home no-questions-asked, even if they're minors themselves), and far more to do with the fact that OP is not legally the child's parent even if he biologically is. In IL, a father is presumed to be the father of a child if he is married to the mother. If not married to the mother (at the time of birth or conception) then paternal parentage must be established through the Court. It's further complicated that he lives out of state. If he was in state, DCFS my place the child with him temporarily while parentage is established, but they won't let him leave the state with the child. OP could be a squeaky-clean billionaire with a background in early childhood development and with three experienced nannies on staff and DCFS still wouldn't simply hand this child over to him.
