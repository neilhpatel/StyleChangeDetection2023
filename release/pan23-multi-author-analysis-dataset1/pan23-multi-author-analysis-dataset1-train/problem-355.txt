I feel that, in general people shouldn't take advice from adults (like the pope) that have imaginary friends that they listen to for guidance in important matters that affect millions of people. I think this is important ESPECIALLY when that invisible friend wants to kill everyone on earth when he returns with his dad after they set up house on earth. Some followers want to even hasten the return of the invisible shepherd by invoking the nuclear winter. So with that said, what they advise may certainly not be wise for the rest of humanity when these people want to welcome the heat of 11 million degrees for 8ms upon the earth just so that their sky daddy can return to give them the riches of the earth, simply because they loved him back.
2.) Continue sanctions. Doesnâ€™t matter who is in charge. These sanctions need to be imposed until they give up their nukes. Make sure to their military can not get the parts they need to rebuild. These sanctions will literally last 30 years at least. Ground the Russians to the ground. They have proven they are a terrorist state. They do not have the right to have nukes.
