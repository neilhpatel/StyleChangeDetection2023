Actually it had very important military consequences. Before that raid Japanese army was opposed to navy plan of taking Midway, considering it too risky and poorly planned. But after raid army felt humiliated and agreed to follow that plan to restore its honour. And we know how it ended.
While all of that is true, one thing that a lot of folks don't fully comprehend is that if EVERY battleship damaged at Pearl Harbor was irrevocably sunk (instead of most of them being salvaged and back in action eventually), AND all of the carriers were present AND sunk, AND the Imperial Japanese Navy suffered ZERO losses from then until the end of 1942, the US Navy in the Pacific would still have outnumbered them on new-build production alone.
4. Comply fully with Ukrainian investigation and prosecution of war crimes, including surrendering all persons required as defendants or witnesses.
You dont get it. All important people who make decisions live in Moscow, and they are not willing to risk getting blown up. It is other Russians who can be blowed up without consequences. Common Russians dont matter. Bridge does not matter. However life threat to themselves is unacceptable. So they would have to make sure Ukraine wont repeat something like that. And the only thing which has not been used yet is nukes. If they just launch missile strikes again, Ukraine would just shrug (it has been done many times already, so who cares) and keep bombing Moscow. So they would nuke something at Ukraine and say "thats what will happen to all your cities if you dont stop".
Of course tactical nuke would be enough to show off force, Ukraine is not suicidal to keep attacking Moscow after that. Not to mention that attacking Moscow has no practical benefits to begin with; all it would do is escalate situation, anger population and boost support of war. Just as "effective" as bombing Kiev is.
