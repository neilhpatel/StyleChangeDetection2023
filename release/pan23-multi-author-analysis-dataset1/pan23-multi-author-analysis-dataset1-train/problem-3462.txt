That's sadly not an option I know that's make things worse her parents work with the police and such they'd sweep this all under the rug and she'd probably be worse off she technically didn't say she'd do it but she said I'm the only reason she's here which yaknow worries me. Theyre not accepting her is her main issue. She's not allowed to do any of the things she wants she's forced to be a boy when she's a girl and it's hurting her seriously. They'll take her away if it isn't swept under the rug and then I'd be unable to contact her and we'll then idk how I'd be or she would be. Idk what to do. She has money 900+ and she'd have a place to live. I looked it up and it said that as long as you can support yourself she technically can emancipate but I don't know maybe it was wrong? I just feel so guilty leaving her but I can't do anything and I love her so much.
Suicidality is incredibly complicated. It often isn't as simple as a one-factor problem. You are absolutely not qualified to handle this.
