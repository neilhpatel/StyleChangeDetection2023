Not the deep state. republicans. Tons of black cowboys/farmers denied public funds because the ones earmarked for them were declared racist by conservatives EVEN THOUGH black cowboys been historically denied loans and access to other capital to stay afloat.

Mexicans? Those were the actual cowboys… I mean clearly the GOP thinks that they are bad. Or does he mean the Hollywood dudes?

Seems to me that the Republicans want to wipe out the American cowboys.
