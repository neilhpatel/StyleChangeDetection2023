Second, trickle down gives rich people more money. When you give me more money I don't spend it all right away, I save and invest most of it for retirement so I can stop working. If you give my grandfather, who's been retired for fifteen years, money he puts it into his bank account and his life doesn't change. He plans on giving that to his family so they can stop working and enjoy their lives. I don't know any responsible adults who when given more money spend it, and rich people are responsible because they have responsible people control their money if they aren't responsible themselves.
Irresponsible students? How do you get that? Many many students are paying off loans for years. Nothing they are doing is irresponsible. Costs for college continue to rise and it's getting out of reach for many people. Loans are the only way.
terrible analogy. some of us aren't complete fucking losers and actually have a a wife or gf and dont wanna use condoms because some right wing lunatic doesnâ€™t believe in the pill.
