While there is always more to be said on the topic, the basic outline that I summarized before in is still valid (though a recent scientific article published since my linked post (Ledger, Girdland-Fink & Forbes 2019) suggests that the Norse people might sometimes take a visit in L'Anse aux Mewdows in course of the 11th century).
Gotta love when a study goes viral. I'm curious on your thoughts about it, though; when I read the article I wasn't terribly impressed. The study itself is well-enough done, and addressed my fears both about driftwood causing issues and about being able to date a C14 flux so precisely. However, some of the interpretive assertions - particularly the confident assertion of it to a "cosmic ray event" when all their citations say it is at best "plausible" and the claim this is "the earliest known year by which human migration had encircled the planet" - rub me very much the wrong way and I think strongly overstate the significance of this novel methodology.

Ultimately, one of my big problems is that it feels designed to over-intepret to get a lot of media attention, even though it isn't actually changing that much - we've known since the 1960s that LAM was extremely likely to be an early 11th century site, and lo and behold, it is.
