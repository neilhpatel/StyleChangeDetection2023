No, it's different gradien at best. Considering the life critical part is gone, vaccines have been developed, immunity has been developed, more is on the way and making a handwavey "pandemic is over" statement is not the same as hiding stupid videos from the country next to you to hide your mistakes. There might be a chance that CCP is trying to buy time to readjust their policy but I don't buy it. It's been a few months of people going insane in their apartments.
EDIT: Unfortunately people are downvoting because they disagree. Downvoting pushes comments down so that they are less visible. Right now there are three groups in the US: People who suffer Long Covid, people who know others who suffer Long Covid, and people who don't care because it hasn't affected them. If you don't care then don't push down on the people who do. We are more sick of hearing about Covid and living around it than anyone, believe me.
Meanwhile, its position was supposed to be _geographically genius_ because it would be a third prong to Beijing and Tianjin (making for a neat triangle area), both of which are considerable economic powerhouses of the modern Chinese economy. IIRC, they are even so successful that those cities are struggling to cope with the massive growth, and Xiong'an was meant to take those pains away. I think the eventual goal was to make it feasible for the three cities to eventually fuse into one huge megacity metropolis area that people tend to associate with the future of urbanism and economic prosperity.
