Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, on the other hand, share direct borders with either ruzzia or Belaruz. There are relatively few rivers or mountains to slow an attack down, and aside from Poland, they have precious little land to trade for time and reinforcements. They are relatively flat, and the theory before the war in Ukraine was that a massed tank assault would tear through quickly if they were not well defended. Now we know that isn't something ruzzia can really pull off, but still. There is also the fact that it would likely be easier to pull off naval attacks from the Baltic than the Black Sea. The ruzzians do not have nearly the same force projection or reinforcement capabilities in the Black sea, and are limited by Turkey's control over the straits.
No. It's just that we, on the south end of the eastern flank of NATO need the same "care" the northern part had since a few many years now. Because the heat is here in fact, not in the north.
I agree that Romania, Slovakia etc should have the same sized deployments as the baltic states but the reality is Ukraine already shields the south combined with the fact the baltic states have no strategic depth like Romania, once the baltic front lines collapse they literally don't have enough space or time to reconstitute them hence the focus on protecting them from possible aggression.
We don't want to fight you. Unfortunately you chose to fight us while forgetting your greatest enemy in Asia. ðŸ¤· That if you're Russian.
Plus Romania has some pretty solid geographical advantages. A large and dense mountain range and numerous rivers makes Romania difficult to invade compared to the Baltic states that are much more flat.
