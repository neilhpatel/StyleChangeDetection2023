Oh surely peace is the answer, but it's not going to come from Erdogan. He's too far gone down the rabbit hole of authoritarian narcissism. They all buy their own propaganda at some point.

At 4am everyone was in bed. Looking at 100 -200k or more. There are villages and towns in the mountains that no one has visited yet. Some wiped off the map. Most are in the snow waiting with no help.
The problem is not this however, people notice this, it is the slow degradation of standards that are got away with, and eventually you end up with a society accepting poor standards because it didn't fall on them, it took 20 years to come around.

It is one thing when it falls on your head, something is done, another when it slowly infects your toe nail until your foot needs amputating.
