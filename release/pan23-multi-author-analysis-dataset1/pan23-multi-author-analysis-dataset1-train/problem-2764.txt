One of them works directly with me and the other is more-or-less a delivery person for the company we work for. Whenever the latter comes in to check in for the day they always both share a bro-hug and then the one I work with will say something like "yoooo did you hear about [insert hushed but obvious whispers of some conservative internet/media sphere crazy shit that is transphobic, calls democratic politicians fascists, etc.]" to which the other guy will be like "oh yeah man fuck 'em all these fuckin' piece of shit liberal woke fucks won't know what's comin for 'em some day soon, fuck man, this country is fuckin deranged" etc etc. and I'm just like... wow, they're serious. I know for a fact the dude I work closely with frequents 2A extremist sites, is an avowed Infowars devotee, etc but it's just so insane to me how utterly detached and conditioned to believe nonsense these right-wingers are.
I work with a couple conspiracy theorist conservatives and they are extremely deranged and live in an entire other reality.
Bro, he's my friend. He doesn't give a fuck. It wasn't a confrontation, we were talking about all this stuff going on, and he volunteered it. You don't know anything.
Conservatives demand followers of their ideology be as dishonest as possible. Having to tell the truth is a sign of weakness to them.
