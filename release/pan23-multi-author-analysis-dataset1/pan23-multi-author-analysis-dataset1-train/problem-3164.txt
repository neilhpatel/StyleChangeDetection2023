So being released without those events means you weren't charged yet. The arrest was likely just as a consequence of the DV complaint, and the prosecutor is investigating and considering whether to charge you.
That's typical if police lack sufficient evidence to support a charge, but policy required an arrest (like in many DV arrests). In general, you can't be detained for more than 72 hours without being charged (a formal arraignment where you're told about the criminal charges and plead not guilty) and given an opportunity to get bail.
I think you also say you were in jail for 48 to 72 hours, and were released without participating in an arraignment or a bail hearing.
Very informational, I appreciate it. One last question, I know technically DA has up to 3 - 4 years to charge me with a crime. In practice, how long do they usually take on average? Because this is felony this serious (even though no one was seriously injured or required any medical attention) wouldn’t they have tried to prosecute right away if they had legit evidence. Why don’t they just let it go so I can move on with my life?
