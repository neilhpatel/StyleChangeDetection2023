You should get a 1099-C in the mail from the lending bank. It will indicate what year the debt was forgiven. You will file the form like any other tax form that you received. If you donâ€™t do your own taxes then just make sure that you bring that form along with your other tax related documents to your tax preparer.
I am really confused and probably misunderstanding everything. Can you elaborate? My understanding is that since it was "forgiven" (or charged off as is the case), I need to pay taxes on that amount (10K) for that reason, because that counts as income that wasn't taxed. I am also having trouble figuring out what tax year that would fall into. The year she was murdered I was in my career and making decent money. But the following year, which is probably when it was charged off, I barely worked at all as the following couple of years. I don't know where that would fit into the taxes. I have spent the entire time since this post and on the phone with the IRS, and after a long wait I was hung up on and when I called back I got a message that the queue was full and to try back later. I am hesitant to even contact them but I am also worried about getting into some sort of trouble for tax evasion or something.
