For China, it's ideological to a very large extent. Putin's "multipolar world" appeals to the Chinese mindset and their own view of themselves in the world - since the USSR fell, the world has been a unipolar one: The US leads, everyone else follows, because there is no real challenger to the US hegemony. Russia is nowhere near the threat the USSR was (and now even less so), and while China has been building up economically and militarily, it's practically surrounded by US allies, something they definitely don't appreciate, especially now that they're by many accounts a near-peer to the US.
1. Russia has thousands of nukes. If Russia Balkanizes then China may end up bordering many unstable nuclear powers. This is not in China’s national interests.
Thiiiiiis. Not vietnamese, and respectfully visited your country as an American many years ago. A lot of the infrastructure at the time for new roads, bridges, and dams were funded by China and a lot of the locals in Hanoi let their “fuck america for what you did” sentiments be known to me. I met a lot of amazing kind people, but tbh I wouldn’t trust the while country to choose America over China. Communist flags everywhere is really the biggest sign of which side they’d choose imo.
Exactly. People are acting like every company would just pull out of China like they did with Russia. People are severely underestimating how much trade Western countries do with China.
2. China already trades with Russia as it is. They don’t need Russia to break apart in order for them to keep trading with Russia.
