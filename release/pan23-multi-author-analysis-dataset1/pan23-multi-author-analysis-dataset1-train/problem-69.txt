The book is a study of historical memory and misuse of history. To summarize it in short, here's the book blurb:
In fact, the idea of Europe was based on multiple ideals: religious opposition (if we take the numerous crusades that somewhat made european monarchs band together against muslims), culture (with the humanism current and the will to establish a common culture), and then mostly peace because of the WW, and economic reasons, since the ECSC was all about fair-trade.
Ok. In order to avoid picking a fight with the other answer, I will work to write my own competing answer that rectifies its inaccuracies. At least then it will have to be evaluated on its merits, rather than whether it's too nitpicky or too combative.
In 799, Charlemagne was deemed "pater Europ√¶" by the court poet Angilbert, inscribing into history and creating the myth that notoriously first papal-crowned emperor Charlemagne was the father of Europe -- and with that came the understanding that uniting a substantial amount of people through religion (read: killing entire villages if they refused to convert to catholicism) throughout a vast part of Europe was the first stone to Europe's foundation, and especially its catholic roots. Except... not entirely, no.
