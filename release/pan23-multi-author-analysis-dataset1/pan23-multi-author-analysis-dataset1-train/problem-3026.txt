It is. The UN was literally lied to by Colin Powell about WMD trucks that were in Iraq that turned out weren’t even real. That resulted in the deaths of poor brown folks for 20 years and nothing to show for it. If you ask me if the UN can’t get governments under control then wtf is it for? Scolding children who don’t listen?
