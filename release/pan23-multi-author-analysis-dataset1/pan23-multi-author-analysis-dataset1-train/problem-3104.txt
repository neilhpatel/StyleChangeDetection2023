Well shit. I don’t know about you all but I am so relieved that Biden in fact is not banning gas stoves. Who cares about all of our government institutions being put in a chokehold hold by fascist fucking losers who will once again investigate themselves as doing nothing wrong. CRT being taught in law school is a way more pressing subject then having fascists erode our democracy and build it in their psychotic image. Who cares about body autonomy? Not this chap, I’m more concerned about drag Queen story hour. Good thing we have Biden and his team commenting on the real problems like Dr fucking Seuss and not the fact that we really had a chance to take back our country by holding the insurrectionist leaders accountable and not letting them anywhere near power. Oh well, at least those pesky trans women won’t be able to compete in women’s sports.
