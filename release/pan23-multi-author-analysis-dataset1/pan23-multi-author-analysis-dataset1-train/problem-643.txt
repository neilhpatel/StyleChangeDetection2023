It’s an interesting situation to say the least, but at least in theory you can sue another party for either monetary damages or for specific performance of the terms of a contract. At first blush it’s not unreasonable to argue that you paid for goods and services, i.e. to take a certain amount of courses of your choosing from the school’s curriculum and upon completion of a predetermined number of credits in good standing to be presented with a diploma. If you’ve indeed held up your end of the contract by paying for your courses and completing said amount of credits and maintaining good standing with the school’s rules and regulations, you may be able to sue them for specific performance of the delivery of your degree. Having said that, that’s the theoretical “law school exam” answer. In reality, the school has tremendously more resources than you do and a legal approach may be cost prohibitive and not the prudent approach to take.
Thanks. That is what I have done so far and am planning to keep doing (unless people thought this was something I would need an attorney for).
I'll hold off on a lawyer for a bit and see what comes out of getting others involved outside of the business school.
If it doesn't look promising after I hear back later this week I'll lawyer up and see what they say about this whole mess.
