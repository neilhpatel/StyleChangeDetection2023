I think what they mean is not to prevent official government presence on social media, but instead prevent it being used on government-owned equipment that is not directly involved with that official presence. In other words, one can still have official accounts for legistators, government departments, and so forth; but if government employees not directly involved with it want to use social media they will have to use their own devices.
Why is this even a story? TikTok and social media shouldn’t be on a government device period, it’s a matter of national security. Installing anything like this on my work phone wouldn’t even cross my mind.

Definitely agree. I do a lot of social media investigations for work using a dummy account on an ultra secure desktop with approval/oversight, so it’s not always so black and white I suppose. Mobile phones are just a security nightmare.
