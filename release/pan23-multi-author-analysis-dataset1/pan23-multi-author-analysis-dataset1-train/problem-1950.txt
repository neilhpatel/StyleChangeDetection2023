Yes, I guarantee you that everyone reading this is smashing their forehead against their desk or table at the coffee shop. What are the overall finances, what are the overall assets, is this money more than 50% of the total value within the marriage currently? If the earnest money plus the downpayment is (say) 10% of the total assets, then, well, bad idea but not catastrophic. How much is it?
I probably don't want to get further entangled, but currently he ISN'T my ex (yet), and if he wants to buy a house, I don't think I can stop him, besides the earnest money he put down would be lost and I don't want either of us to lose that. I understand the return will be limited and the money would be better off in a different type of investment. I just don't know if I want to ruin his plans. I don't want to be petty. I'm all mixed up about it.
"I'm going to take the majority of our assets, buy myself and my new partner a house, and pay you back a decade from now at 5%" is one of those _extremely_ optimistic offers that one makes early in the process, before they've started to internalize that it's not just their money, or less cheerfully, if they think their ex is a complete sap who will roll over easily. I hope it's more optimism than malice.
