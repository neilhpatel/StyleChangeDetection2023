so all the other countries that make up 'the west', and the conflicts they start or are involved in, don't matter? why is that exactly,i am ever so curious?
After Georgia, the stunt they pulled 2014, pretty open plans they had to take Moldova after their expected glorious win in Ukraine and near constand invoking of a great Russian Empire that includes a lot of countrys that simply dont want to be part of that shit show its clear they wont stopp If they dont fail hard in Ukraine now.
2. They still need Russia for fuel. So does the surrounding nations so no Russia will absolutely win and subsequently fall on its own considering Europeans don't like having children. ( old people don't buy stuff and can't work).
The only reason it is sometimes seen as more safe if russia collapses into different countrys ist their constant propaganda about war with the west, "liberating" or bombing capital citys of Nato countrys and so one.
I love your ridiculous version of events. Where Ukraine and West want nuclear war but it's also Russia who "eventually launch nukes". And it's Russia currently invading another country.
4. America doesn't need Europe, Europe needs America. Nato is basically a way to save money on not having an army. America is slowly starting to see how useless it is to keep up a pace to stop nazis and communists. Both regimes are almost certain to never happen again. You know with the whole average European age being like 40 something.
