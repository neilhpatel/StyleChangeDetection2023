Also what the flick I am going to do if he charges? I have a 120lbs who’ll step up if we are threatened but also have a 5lbs puppy. Before the tiny one thinking of breaking up a dog fight seemed extremely challenging by myself (these Aholes freeze up when they see real dog fight and I’ll be the one who has to step up risking getting injured.) but with the tiny one, it’s super risky. She is the size of the other dog’s muzzle. I desperately want to move to the countryside where I won’t see my next door neighbor with bare eyes just by using binoculars. Haha.
I would be doing whatever you can to get documentation of her walking off leash and take it to animal control.. you could also speak to your neighbors and see if any of them would also speak to animal control as witnesses. Your fears are totally valid I have a neighbor who walks daily with a big stick and pepper spray, you could start doing the same if it makes you feel better. I’d personally be nervous to carry pepper spray in the event I got myself or one of my animals, but a big stick might do the trick Good luck!
Exactly! Than the off leashed dog will feel triggered and will attack. I really can’t understand why is it so hard for her to click the leash. It’s on her anyways. Idiot.
