>In June the Office of Censorship asked newspapers and broadcasters to avoid discussing "atom smashing, atomic energy, atomic fission, atomic splitting, or any of their equivalents. The use for military purposes of radium or radioactive materials, heavy water, high voltage discharge equipment, cyclotrons." The office also asked to avoid discussion of "polonium, uranium, ytterbium, hafnium, protactinium, radium, rhenium, thorium, deuterium"; only uranium was sensitive, but was listed with other elements to hide its importance.
He's talking about the German foundry that China wants to buy. What's interesting about a deal like this is to buy an obsolete and declining foundry is what China most likely wants to do with it. If I were to guess, it would be to create a market for their own equipment. China currently has an entire line of equipment from etching to lithography that can produce 28nm without any American equipment. There are also rumours that SMEE is almost done with arf immersion thus they would be able to create 14nm and possibly 7nm with SMIC's process.
