The Jews in Palestine didn’t really seem to care one way or another - the rulers of the land had changed, but their own status didn’t, they were still a second-class population.
From the other perspective, the crusaders were aware of their Jewish subjects, but they didn’t know about (or care about) the various different Jewish sects. As mentioned, there were Karaites, who used only the Torah and rejected the Talmud, although most of the Jews were Rabbinic Jews who did use the Talmud. In Nablus, there were also Samaritans, who had their own version of the Torah. The crusaders recognize the Samaritans as a separate group, presumably because of the “Good Samaritan” story in the Gospels. (I always imagine crusaders arriving in the Near East and being shocked to discover that Samaritans were real, not just characters from a story.).
In a course I took on the crusades my professor talked about how the persecutions of many of the jews in Germany were inspired by apocalyptic texts that described conversion of the jews as ushering in the return of the messiah. Do you have any knowledge of this sentitment continuing into the governance of the crusader states? Another question is would you say the Crusader States became more ‘secular’ once they actually set up shop and began governing?
