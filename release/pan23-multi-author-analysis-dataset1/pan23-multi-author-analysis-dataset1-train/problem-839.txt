In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I'll give you one. Largely medical is kinda a joke. What other "medicine" do you light on fire and inhale? You just go to some guy tenuously holding on to his medical license in a shady strip mall and say your ankle hurts and you get a weed card.
Seriously. I’ve often considered the types of selfish justifications politicians could make for legalization, beyond anything monetary, and one of the most obvious to me is pacification of an increasingly disgruntled populace. A closely associated line of reasoning, what you describe, would be legalization to offer a more comfortable condition of experience while we’re subjected to the impacts of their perpetual corruption. Put another way, if you’re going to f us, at least use lube.
