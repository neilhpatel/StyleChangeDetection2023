Some of the worst contamination events were caused by people that just didn't know they were dealing with radioactive materials. The biggest example I can think of is the Goiania Incident.
Specifically florescent paint. Anything that undergoes florescence is just absorbing a photon, getting to an excited/energized state, and spitting it back out at a different wavelenh of (usually) lower energy.
There I said it. As long as they are not screen blocking, speaker shredding, navigation disabling monsters. Banners, sidebars, 500 vertical feet of clickbait below the article, all good. Just don't cover the actual content.
I never really studied the underlying mechanics of it in too great of detail, but I remember measuring the half-lives of some different fluorescent/phosphorescent materials as part of a physics lab, and natural ruby was the most interesting, since it can contain multiple half-lives due to defects in the material.
Yeah a ton of clocks are like that. Also glow-in-the-dark materials on watches and such are often radioactive. Some countertop materials are radioactive, and smoke detectors use radioactive materials to detect smoke.
Radioactive materials have a ton of very useful applications and are basically harmless compared to background radiation we get are exposed to all day everyday.
