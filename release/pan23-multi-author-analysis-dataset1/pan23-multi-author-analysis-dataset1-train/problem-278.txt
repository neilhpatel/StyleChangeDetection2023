I mean, the comments he makes in the linked video are pretty sparse and very general (and quite obviously extend beyond the Early Middle Ages, e.g. in reference to the Plague or, although he doesn't specifically name it, the Hundred Years War), so lacking some more extensive discussion, or perhaps the consultation of a psychic, I'm not sure I can really speculate about whether he's got this idea of Late Antiquity either implicitly or explicitly in mind. But to be perfectly honest, I'd be surprising if it were more than very generally in the background here, as I don't get the impression that the scholarly discussion around Late Antiquity has made any significant inroads into popular perceptions of the period. (Ward-Perkins actually makes this exact point in The Fall of Rome (p. 4) in reference to one of Bernard Cornwell's books.).
These uses are less common today than before, but it isn't due to political correctness, but more due to the term being easily misunderstood (as meaning something like the original Renaissance meaning). Why use an ambiguous term that is easily misunderstood?
