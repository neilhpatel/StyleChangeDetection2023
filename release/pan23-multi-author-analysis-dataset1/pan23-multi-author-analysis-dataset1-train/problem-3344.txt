Someone give me the cliff notes on how Winnie The Pooh went from the forest to the head of China? I clearly stopped paying attention to these books after childhood.
They know that strategically with AUKUS, 5 eyes and recent instability in “South China sea” that Australia, NZ and others in the region cannot allow China to obtain the influence/foothold they have achieved further north.
wrong. the KMT didn't lose because they lost too many troops. they lost the war because they lost the mandate of heaven as the Chinese call it. they were unable to protect ordinary Chinese, allowing them to be slaughtered and raped by the Japanese and the whites while the KMT was in power. They totally lost support of the people. China had a population of 400 millions at that time, filling a couple of millions troops was not a problem. the KTM lost because of its incompetence.
Disenchanted with the fascination of these upcoming superpower countries. The OG superpower countries have already shown their true colours, and the reality has been established for the rest...cannon fodder.
