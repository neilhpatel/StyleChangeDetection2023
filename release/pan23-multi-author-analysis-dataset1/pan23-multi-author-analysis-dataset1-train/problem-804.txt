- an attitude of blaming the military leaders rather than the civilians (encouraged by the Allies but not exclusively their idea).
re: "embracing the narrative" -- remember, the narrative thread from the start was "blame the military leadership". The kamikaze fighters (someone relevant for the game at issue) are a good example -- it wasn't until the 90s that the far-right really tried a "they made a noble sacrifice" narrative, up to then, the general impression was they were a national tragedy and being pushed into something they didn't want to do.
It's not recorded why the perspective was from the American side (where the objective is to wipe out vast numbers of Japanese planes), but I'm hoping the story I've given leading to this has given a strong case how they could have considered such a thing; when the "war itself" becomes a tragedy rather than individual sides, it's possible to see from an opposing perspective. (What I have not found any evidence for was the theory that this was an accommodation for the international market; while sales were initially a slow burn -- according to the interview, this was because it was released the same time as IREM's hit Kung-Fu Master -- it did well in both the US and Japan.).
Or simply, the people who designed the game fully embraced the post-war narrative that depicted their parents and grandparents as murderers, disconnecting them from that history. I just throwing things out, but I just discovered that game through this post and I find the thing incredibly interesting.
