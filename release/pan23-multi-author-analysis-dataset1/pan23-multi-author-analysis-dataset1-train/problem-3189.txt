I guess it is useless for me to show you the tens of thousands of dead people that were brutally killed and tortured by the Shah and his secret police (SAVAK) since you would ignore those human rights abuses as long as people can go to drag shows. Disgusting and despicable mindset.

>A dictatorship has to promulgate some sort of distant goals and moral ideals in order to justify its rule and the people’s immolation; the extent to which it succeeds in convincing its victims, is the extent of its own danger; sooner or later, its contradictions are thrown in its face by the best of its subjects: the ablest, the most intelligent, the most honest. Thus a dictatorship is forced to destroy and to keep on destroying the best of its “human resources.” And be it fifty years or five centuries later, ambitious thugs and lethargic drones are all a dictatorship will have left to exploit and rule; the rest will die young, physically or spiritually.
