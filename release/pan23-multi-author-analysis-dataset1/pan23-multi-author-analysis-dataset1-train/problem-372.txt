This is happening again because we didn't punish the South enough the first time and reconciled during reconstruction. These GQP vagrants need to understand that they don't pay for jackshit. The liberals and progressives pay for them, we burned them down and changed their society against their wishes, in the past and we will do it again. They are not the only ones with guns. They have a right to fear a progressive well funded army. So, let them succeed and we will watch them fail and take in their refugees. We just need to wash our hands at this point.

California? New York? Illinois? Yea, the world economy would be in the shitter. Hell, Michigan is a sleeper, it has one border, most of the world's fresh water, and is an engineering powerhouse.
