That's a bit silly and ridiculous. I was separating those out in my answer. That is not an itinerary. You wouldn't normally put restaurants and zoos and arcades and museums on an itinerary. You could list them out separately. But it's not practical or reasonable to require you to put down 10:00 AM - 11:22 AM "Eating fifth and sixth bites of corn dogs at GPS coordinates XYZ,ABC while facing southeast.".
NAL, but based on other responses to similar questions, an itinerary must consist of the flight numbers, destination cities, and hotel contact information. There is no need to give minute by minute or even hourly details. You really should contact the lawyer that did your divorce and custody arrangements to confirm this, rather than rely on the internet, but it seems like the info you already gave him should be plenty. Worse case scenario, give him the second option: "...or the name and telephone number of an available third person who knows where the child or parent may be located." In the age of ubiquitous cell phones, any of your friends or relatives can be available and can know where you are at any moment.
Obviously that wouldn't happen. First of all, you'd not be in Indiana. Second of all, in the Indiana language, "whenever a child travels out of the area with either parent." When they are in your new state, they are in the area. The area of your new home/state.
