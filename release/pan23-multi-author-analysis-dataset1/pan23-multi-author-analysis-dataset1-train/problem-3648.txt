In 2012 ukraine discovered tons of new natural gas deposits (using new technology). If ukraine started exporting gas to europe, it would price out russia and cause economic collapse.
If europe is allowed an alternate source of gas, it will collapse russia’s economy. What we are seeing is the death throws of a failed state. They aren’t going to give up, they aren’t going to stop. There will be no negotiation.
>Another TASS report even allegedly cited Pavel Gubarev, the self-proclaimed leader of pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk, admitting in an interview with Russian television Rossiya 24 on 19 May that one of the key reasons for the fighting is Kyiv’s push to “continue development of shale gas on the territory of Ukraine”.
No, it's not that simple. Putin wants to recreate the Russian empire of old, but more importantly he absolutely cannot allow an independent democratic successful Ukraine, because the Russian people are going to look at Ukraine and ask themselves why aren't we doing that, because we're completely fucked under a communist dictatorship. Its more about maintaining control than money.
