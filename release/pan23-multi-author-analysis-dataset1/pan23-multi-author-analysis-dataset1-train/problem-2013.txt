ETA: As an aside, I'm not even sure how he would go about enforcing this. All OP would have to do is give a P.O. box as a forwarding address and not list the LL as a reference....Unless the LL has some underground connection with all of the landlords in KC, how would he even know? And if it's a one-year fixed-term lease, he has no contractual say in whether or not OP chooses to renew. All around a very strange clause.
You'll need to wait for someone with specific knowledge of the law in KC, MO to give an opinion on whether the law allows for that sort of agreement, but as a practical matter instead of worrying about whether it's legal and enforceable you should view this as an indication of the character of and what it will be like to deal with this landlord. Reasonable people would not try to force others to be trapped into only renting from them for 5 years. That's not normal or standard in any area. The fact that this person would ask this indicates s/he isn't likely to be reasonable about other dealings, either.
(2) Absolutely non-standard. Probably not enforceable, but you never know, and you don't really want to go through the time and expense of finding out.
