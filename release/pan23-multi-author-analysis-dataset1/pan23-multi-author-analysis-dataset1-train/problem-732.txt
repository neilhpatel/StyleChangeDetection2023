I remember you talking about this during a lecture at the university You were a great professor and helped and inspired me to pursue an info sci career after graduating.
I try for Name_Year_Important_Words_Title. Sometimes they’re impossible to read, due to the lenh, and it gets weird when there are two articles from the same year (not uncommon in linguistics, my other area of interest). Then some titles are weird, so it’s a summary not a shortened title. Or there are too many coauthors. Oh well!
Ultimately, strong moderation benefits the /r/AskHistorians subreddit. The arguments that it fosters trust and elevates accurate information through academic review is a strong argument, and reflected in many other forums, particularly those outside of the internet. However reddit itself is not an academic forum. It’s 20 million registered members are not all academics, it’s 100 million viewers are not all academics. The article fails to establish these millions as a “cesspool”, and does not really attempt to do so, except through its title and the niche perspectives of this subreddit through selected negative content.
Understood. The question was simple, (Why was Rod Stewart so successful?), and if you know any historian who can come up with an answer for people's taste in general, good luck. OP was obviously unaware of Stewart's huge hits in the 90s, so factually pointing them out was the most anyone could do without going into why people like somebody, what is not a history question anyway.
