I think you drew a correct conclusion from incorrect reasoning. Uni in Japan and probably most of southeast Asia is ridiculously easy. I went to Keio in Tokyo, and before that I went to Fudan in Shanghai. I talked about this with many friends, and I had a friend from Tokyo U as well as a friend from Kyoto U agreeing with me. University in Japan is sometimes referred to as the "vacation of your life". But the entrance exams are tough and high school is tough.
Now while this is a general guide some governments do have agreements with others that do recognize that land as legally no longer belonging to them, as far as I know most if not all of these agreements are between the Holy See(The Catholic Church but not actually the country of Vatican City) and some nations in Europe. But since the Holy See isnâ€™t technically a country despite being sovereign that actually just makes shit more complicated.
Exactly. In no prefecture is having sex with someone under 18 legal (Romeo/Juliet laws aside). That being said it wasn't considered "rape" between consenting parties.
