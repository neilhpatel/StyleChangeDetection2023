Intention doesn't matter. You went 70 in a speed zone where 70 wasn't even close to being allowed. Since you mentioned talking to friends I wonder if they pushed you to go faster.
Well the classes are only $100 and I would only have to take them once and I think it’s just a four hour course and on the paper it says if I take the class I will not have to pay for the ticket but I’ll still have to show up to court but either way there’s no way I can afford a lawyer but when I do go to court I do plan on pleading guilty.
Either way. Not safe. Not acceptable and the judge is going to give you a lecture for it. Do what you can before then to minimize the damage and don't say anything like "I was paying attention my friends" or "I wasn't looking at the speedometer" or "I had no idea I was going 70 in a 40 zone". None of that will help you. "I screwed up. I will do better in the future" is your only thing to say. I didn't know at was going 28 miles over the speed limit will not go over well with a judge at all. To go back go your original question - THIS is why 15+ requires you to go in front of a judge. If you don't realize you are going 28 miles over the speed limit that is a MAJOR problem.
