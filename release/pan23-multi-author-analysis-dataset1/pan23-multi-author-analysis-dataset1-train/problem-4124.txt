Nor is this a new trend, and has as much philosophical origins as practical. Remember the Founding and Framing generation were not generally big fans of standing armies, many could still remember Boston under British occupation before the Revolution, and of course the actual war itself. Even those that did support a regular force werent looking for a large one. Thus local militia units played a far larger role in public celebrations, reviews and parades, gun salutes and all that with the role still today carried on by many communities having local National Guard units in their own small parades for 4th of July and other holidays. So another aspect of military participation in public celebration but one reflective of the fact that for 150 years the US Army was relatively small, not concentrated near major urban centers, and institutionally not occupying the same respected central space it does today.
So yes there has been at least military participation in many public celebrations including the 4th, going back to the early national history, but rarely anything more than a ceremonial contingent, and usually as just one of several organizations participating. With exceptions being very context heavy.
Very interesting. I hadn't considered celebrations such as Fleet Week to be a rendition of this sort of celebration of the military. Very informative, thank you! And that article is also really good, thank you for sharing .
