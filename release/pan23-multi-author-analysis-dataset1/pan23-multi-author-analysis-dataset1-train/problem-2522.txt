I gotcha! As you said, maintaining the coax network and signal strenh was very costly. That helped spur development of microwave radio relay towers and the establishment of the AT&T Long Lines system, which gradually supplanted the original cable network before itself being replaced by fiber optics and the satellites you mentioned.
No. Video in 1960 was very much an analog feed of modulated waveforms. Even videotape technology was only a few years old. Not until the 1970s were even basic character generators developed, and the use of computers to process video signals didn't begin until the 1980s.
