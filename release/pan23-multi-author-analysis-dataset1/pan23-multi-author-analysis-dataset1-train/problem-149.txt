sounds about right. they do shady ass shit all the time. brother in law worked at one of the jails and apparently found out one of the cops failed to "find drugs on a guy" (me when he stopped me no good reason) and later found to r a female inmate. So glad I'm not living there anymore.

Baring contradictory evidence, It all suggests they murdered a protestor, that cops actually accidentally injured more cops hitting each others in a one sided mass shooting from police agents when they started emptying all their mags on the crowd of protestors (thanks our luck they can't hit the broad side of a barn almost at point blank), and they manufactured false charges against protester critics because they don't like being criticized.
