War elephants were an integral, if perennially problematic, component of Hellenistic armies. On the battlefield, they tended to be stationed either on the wings (to keep the infantry from being flanked) or in a line in front of the infantry at intervals of 50 to 100 feet. A small squadron of archers or slingers was sometimes attached to each elephant, and would follow it throughout the battle. A considerable distance, however, was left between the elephants and other units to give the animals space to retreat or maneuver. Elephants were most effective against cavalry, since their scent and trumpeting terrified horses who had never encountered them. They could also be highly potent against infantry, since the sheer weight of an elephant charge was almost impossible to resist. The great drawback of using war elephants, however, was the fact that elephants, however highly trained, had a nasty tendency to panic when they were injured, and often turned on their troops. This habit was so notorious that the Romans (who only used elephants as pack animals) sometimes dubbed elephants "the common enemy.".
Great comment, but not to be pedantic, but didn’t they use 10 war elephants loaned (or gifted, I forgot) to them by Manisissa in the 2nd Celtiberian war against Numatia where one of the notable instances of war elephants backfiring allegedly happened, when supposedly a sling stone or something hit a Roman’s elephant and caused great casualities in their ranks? I think I saw that anecdote in Livy but I’m not sure if I’m getting details mixed up or if it’s of dubious accuracy.
