It’s possible the police believe you about the texts, but don’t think they rise to the level of a crime. What your friend’s girlfriend did was terrible, but your friend isn’t alive to testify that the texts contributed to the suicide. Suicide is complicated and generally involves lots of factors. If the texts did play a part in your friend’s decision, it’s unclear what part they played and how a court could assign liability to the sender without being able to determine that. The texts would probably be grounds for a harassment complaint, but your friend isn’t able to make that complaint and say they felt harassed. Others have pointed to an SC law that criminalizes one compelling another to commit suicide “by force or duress,” but texting another person nasty messages is unlikely to qualify. (Your friend was not held at gunpoint and told to hurt themselves, nor threatened with specific harm if they did not hurt themselves, etc.).
The two cases in Massachusetts included a more extensive degree of harassment (hundreds of messages per day for months) and a very close in time relationship between knowing about the peril their partner was in and attempting to convince them to go forward with the suicide.
IANAL. I live in Massachusetts where “Conrad’s Law” has been a major topic since it happened. I believe South Carolina has a similar law in place.
