. This may be a situation where it makes sense to hire an estate lawyer to deal with this. It's likely not going to cost that much and will help contain out of control relatives. .
Start thinking about what type of funeral your son would prefer, and your ex would have liked, and check with the funeral home about the number of people allowed during COVID, and whether you would prefer a graveside only service, or just want a cremation and memorial. Make a list of invitees.
Follow this advice immediately. I am a lawyer and have witnessed the looting of estates by relatives and “well wishers” in the past. I also advise that you get surveillance cameras put up right away at the property. Some people are very devious and have no problem with breaking into someone else’s home especially in a situation like this. They will try to take advantage of your son when he is disabled by grief.
Start gathering photographs. One portrait for the front of his funeral program, and a few family snaps for the inside. At least one with your son and daughter would be wonderful. A picture of him doing something he loves would be great.
