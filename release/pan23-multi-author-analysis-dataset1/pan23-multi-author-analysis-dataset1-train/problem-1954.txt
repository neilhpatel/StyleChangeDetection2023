Humpty Dumpty Trumpy is livid because he knows that AG Merrick Garland will have a green light to indict him, as his cult is fast fading, mainly because of the BIG LIE spread that he wanted us to believe, which the 1/6 committee proved that he knew very well he had lost the election and couldn’t handle his defeat like a man like Tim Ryan did so eloquently in his conceding speech, that’s the way you do it. Trump is a sore loser because he wants to show off his ego and is narcissistic beyond his own brain power, that’s what took him down. Trump is dumb he just had a cheerleading corrupt Republican party hanging on by his pants.
