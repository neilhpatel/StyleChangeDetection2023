During the crusades, the Maronites were “rediscovered” by the Latin Europeans. The Maronites lived entirely in the County of Tripoli, not the larger and better-known Kingdom of Jerusalem, and unlike in Jerusalem where there were several groups of eastern Christians, the Maronites were pretty much the only native Christian community in Tripoli. So even when they’re not named specifically, we can guess that when native Christians are mentioned living in the mountains of Lebanon in the County of Tripoli, they must be Maronites. In that case, they weren’t always automatically allies of the crusaders. In the first half of the 12th century, they sometimes allied with the Muslims against the crusaders, and in one case the Count of Tripoli retaliated and attacked some of the communities in the mountains.
Hello! I'm hopping onto OP's original question because you seem really knowledgeable about this. How about the Melkite Greek Catholics in Lebanon, is there anything documented about their relationship with the Crusaders or with the Maronites at that time? The Melkites are said to be the very first Christian sect, predating even the Roman Catholics, so I assume they were also present during the Crusades.
