All the sides will retreat into themselves for a long long time. That many dead will take years to bury, grieve and answer for. And that much military/navy hardware lost, years to replace.
Exactly. The world will be screwed in any case so the U.S. might as well try to defend Taiwan and push back against China, instead of just doing nothing.
China is not making rational, properly considered political decisions. It is a one-man show lead by a siloed authoritarian.
Well yes but that's not all that happens because now China and the US have officially become enemy combatants in a theater of war ( technically we were enemy combatants in the Korean war with the People's Republic of China but at the time we recognized the Republic of China as the true China so we could easily spend it as not being at war with China just a rogue Chinese faction but now since we recognize the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government of China we wouldn't be able to hide behind that facade anymore) which would cause a massive realignment in terms of foreign policy and trade policy.
NATOâ€™s mandate is legally defined and narrow. NATO has zero relevance to a US conflict with Taiwan.
If every NATO member nation helped the US in defending Taiwan NATO itself would still have ZERO involvement in that conflict.
