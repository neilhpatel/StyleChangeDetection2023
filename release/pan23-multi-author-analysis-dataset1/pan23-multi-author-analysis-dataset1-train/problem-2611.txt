Being a terrible boss/co-worker isn’t illegal. Depending on the terms of your contract it would be perfectly legal to fire you for not getting along with another teacher, even if that teacher is unreasonable and asks for unreasonable things from you. Outside of the terms of your contract, which neither the Federal Department of Labor nor the Virginia Department of LAbor and Industry will enforce (you would have to sue in VA district or circuit court depending on the amount in question), it is only illegal to fire you for membership in a protected class or as retaliation having engaged in protected activities.
Best guesses for why she's bullying you? Just doesn't want to do those things and thinks you can be taken advantage of / retaliation for when you argue back, racism, sexism, etc?
Document document document. Get policies in writing. If the other teacher says something, get it from her in writing. It's only a misunderstanding if you don't have it in their own signed explicit words. Good luck.
What this means is that if you are being treated this way because of your membership in a protected class, such as race, sex or sexual orientation (there are others, but I’m giving a sample list here) its illegal to fire you if you don’t like it, even if it might be a breach of contract. The law does not protect against shitty workplace behavior by co-workers in most cases. More information is needed about why you think she is acting this way, but if the answer is just that she is a terrible person there wouldn’t appear to be any legal recourse, although you are of course free to seek a consultation with a local employment law attorney to get a formal opinion from someone in your state.
