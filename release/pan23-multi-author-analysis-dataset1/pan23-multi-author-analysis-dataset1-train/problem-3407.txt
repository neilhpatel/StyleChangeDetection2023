Yeah. Sorry. I mean his voting base has this weird idea about this man who was going to set things right, which unsurprisingly never manifested it's self. It was this weird cognitive dissonance where the anti government crowd continued hating the government even after the dude they elected wom and he hated the government too. So the narrative about liberal elites controlling everything just continued. Trump was the best president ever even though he's some how not in charge at all...
