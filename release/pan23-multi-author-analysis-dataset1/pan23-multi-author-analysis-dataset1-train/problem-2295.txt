An actual blockade would imply China stopping and potentially seizing neutral shipping, including American shipping. The right of American merchants to go anywhere and sell anything around the world has always been policy and casus belli for the Americans. During WWI, America's eventual declaration of war on Germany was directly caused by German Unrestricted Submarine Warfare which killed Americans and impacted American sale of both war contraband and regular goods across the Atlantic. Moreover, at the beginning of the Cold War, the American-led Berlin Air Lift was a strong response to Soviet attempts at blockading West Berlin, as well as a potent demonstration of Allied logistics capability. So the case of a blockade on Taiwan, the United States would have all the moral and historical justification to call China's bluff by sending supplies to Taiwan, forcing China into an uncomfortable position, where they must take the loss, or fire on American ships and risk bringing America into the war.
100% spot on. A week from now these comments will look silly. I'm all for continued talks but until I see China actually say they rule out using military force to unify with Taiwan, there is little or no progress.
Sure but ultimately it comes down to whether or not China plans to invade Taiwan and plans to take full control of the South China Sea. China's support for Russia also doesn't help.
The political spectrum offers more choices than dictatorship/liberal democracy. You are giving a false dichotomy.
