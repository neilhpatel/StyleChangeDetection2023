The HR representative initiated the request when they spoke about it. It has officially moved into the territory of a "verbal request" and they can only deny the request if it causes an undue hardship to the company. The HR representative should request documentation if they need it, but they cannot treat the employee as if he does not have a disability. They should assume that he needs accommodations until they receive supporting documents. They're already on thin ice.
An employer can ask for medical documentation, and even occasionally request up-to-date information but every 4 weeks is way past reasonable - especially for a lifelong condition.
HR here. If you have not engaged in the accommodations process, they are technically able to write you up or even terminate you for violating policies you agreed to as an employee (although that would be such an asshole move, it is legal).
They are. Type 1 diabetes is protected under the ADA as a disability. Also to ask you to report somewhere before going to eat could literally kill you, is there a way to go above that HR person?
