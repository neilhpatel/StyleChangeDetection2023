Either way you've thoroughly patched up a big gap in my understanding of pre-colonial history. If only the Wikipedia article was half this informative..
益溪通津，地势卑窄。山林茂密，田瘠，稻悭。气候热。俗薄。男女椎髻，系花竹布为稍。以象齿树之内室，为供养之具。民煮海为盐，取沙糊为食。地产丁香，其树满山，然多不常生，三年中间或二年熟。有酋长。地每岁望唐舶贩其地，往往以五枚鸡雏出，必唐船一只来；二鸡雏出，必有二只，以此占之，如响斯应。贸易之货，用银、铁、水绫、丝布、巫仑、八节那间布、土印布、象齿、烧珠、青瓷器、埕器之属。.
渤山高环，溪水若淡，田地瘠。民半食沙糊、椰子。气候苦热。俗淫。男女椎髻，露体，系青皮布梢。日间畏热，不事布种，月夕耕锄、渔猎、采薪、取水。山无蛇虎之患，家无盗贼之虞。煮海为盐，酿椰浆为酒，妇织木绵为业。有酋长。地产肉豆蔻、黑小厮、豆蔻花、小丁皮。货用水绫丝布、花印布、乌瓶、鼓、瑟、青瓷器之属.
Thank you This is an absolutely excellent answer You've really gone above and beyond to give a detailed account Absolutely fantastic.
1. What was known as the Moluccas in the 16th century: the 5 small islands of Ternate, Tidore, Makian, Motir and Bacan. At the time, these 5 islands were the only places in the world where cloves were cultivated (although they probably grew wild elsewhere).
By the time the Europeans arrived, there was little to no food grown anywhere on the nutmeg producing islands. To answer one of your questions from an earlier post, thanks to the sophisticated global trade network, spice was cheaper at the source but still highly profitable. The islanders relied on nutmeg to trade for all their needs. Rice was imported from Java and Makassar, and fruit and sago from Seram. Food, cloth, metal-work and slaves were Banda’s top imports. This wasn’t always a direct trade, the Bandanese would often trade their spice for items like cloth, which might in turn be traded for something like fruit. Trade was not always based on barter - coinage was also used.
