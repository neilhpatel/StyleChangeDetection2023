If you refuse to sign a new lease, the landlord has the option to terminate your tenancy with a month's notice.
Definitely not. If the terms of the initial lease indicated that it converts to month-to-month tenancy, then your landlord can't unilaterally change those terms.
But if you want the flexibility to move out when you like or the new 6-month lease comes with changes to the rental terms or a rent hike, then sticking to the month-to-month is probably to your benefit.
If the new lease doesn't involve a rent hike or other term changes and you already plan to stay in the apartment for another 6 months, then there's probably no disadvantage to you signing another 6-month lease.
4. Talk to your landlord and tell him that you'd like to keep living there as a month to month tenant. If he says that is unacceptable to him and if you don't sign the new lease he will end your tenancy, see if you can negotiate a new month to month lease with a longer notice period. Or sign the 6 month lease if you plan to live there another six months. Or move.
