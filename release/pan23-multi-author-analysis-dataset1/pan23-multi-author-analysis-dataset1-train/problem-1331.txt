In any cases I'm aware of, if a lease turns over to month-to-month, all other terms remain the same unless the lease specifically lays out what will happen when it becomes month-to-month (e.g. an automatic rent increase). So, if the tenants were jointly liable on the original lease, they're going to be jointly liable on the month-to-month lease unless there is language in the lease that changes that (which I have never heard of being included, and would be against a landlord's best interests).
Agreed. However the terms for ending the lease (Edit to clarify: to end the month-to-month tenancy in NY “the tenant” needs to notify the landlord. It does not require all tenants notify the landlord N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 232-b) only require notifying the landlord. I am not aware of anything in the law which requires that both tenants agree to end a month-to-month. Surely the tenant that wants out can just notify and surrender their access to the premises? Then the other tenant can either come to their own lease agreement or become a holdover tenant.
However, when the lease term ends, both roommates become month-to-month tenants. Month to month tenants can surrender tenancy by giving proper notice. OP has notified the landlord that she is no longer a tenant and that she no longer accepts joint liability for the premises. Why is that not sufficient?
