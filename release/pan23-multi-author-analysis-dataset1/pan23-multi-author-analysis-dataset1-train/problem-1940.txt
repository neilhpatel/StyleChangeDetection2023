Honestly, there are people who rabidly believe the bullshit she is selling. It scares me in a way not much else does. We can‚Äôt have this many people who do not care about basic facts in these situations. She is just riling them up. Honestly though, at what point do people who believe this feel it is their duty to act? I would be livid if I thought my candidates were being cheated. And these people believe they are being cheated by child raping satanists. They are so far gone. She is playing to her base. Obviously she has no chance of ever winning in a real court. But she needs to fuel the fire she lit.

Lost cause. The jokes about it being a cult are as on the nose as it gets. These folks are no different than the Koresh followers or Heaven's Gate. Deluded. The fusing of fundamentalist christianity and right wing politics by the GOP has sucked most of these simpletons into the void never to return. It's 2 poisons for the price of one basicallyü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
