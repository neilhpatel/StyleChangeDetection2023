2) That there was a religious justification and foundation for caste first and its real life implications second.
The manner in which most scriptures define caste, the caste system or its development and evolution, has little to do with how castes and caste hierarchies actually developed in the real world. For example, texts such as the Purusha Shukta may describe how the "cosmic being was divided into 4 parts and out of each part namely the head, the arms, the torso and the legs, each of the varnas were formed namely the Brahmins, the Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas and the Shudras respectively". However this implies two things, 1) That the caste an individual was born into dictated the occupations he was allowed to choose in life and that throughout history these were the only occupations said individuals chose.
Super interesting. Could you kindly elaborate on the caste/varna system in South India? It does not seem to have taken hold with such tenacity as in the Northern parts of the country.
