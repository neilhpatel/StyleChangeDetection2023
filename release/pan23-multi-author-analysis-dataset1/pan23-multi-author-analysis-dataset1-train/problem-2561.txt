A District Court judge in Texas wrote an absolute garbage opinion with no chance of withstanding appeal saying that Biden and DHS could not set their own immigration enforcement priorities and had to keep Trump's. 5th Circuit and Supreme Court refused to stay the opinion or expedite hearing it, and it took over a year to reach the Supreme Court. So a single Texas district court judge got to set immigration policy for an entire year. It got overturned at the Supreme Court, but the damage was done. Conservative judges could easily do this again.

Meh. I've lived all around the world (including Europe) and everywhere has its problems. Not excusing our problems, but I'll sure do my part to make my voice heard to try to fix them. Happy for you that you are enjoying your life.
