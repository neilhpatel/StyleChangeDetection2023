So you are saying dropping nuclear bombs is as easy cleaning up later? Triggering dictatorships, selling them weapons, and buying resources for cheap is not going to work anymore unless democracy is crushed again with people like Putin, when rest of the world is watching NYOB, anyways answering your question Afghanistan was not as shitty as now 200 years before, they had tight nit communities taking care of themselves, not starving of course.
2. The vast majority of people have basic responsibilities to their families and will keep their heads down. You can't take care of your 6 children if you're dead. You die, then so does your family.
Nope, never backed the Taliban from what I understand, don’t think we got involved in that particular clash at all, officially at least, also I’m guessing old American stuff might be Pakistani donations or stuff captured from the Mujahideen/Northern Alliance.
Any suggestions? I don't want to donate to doctors without borders because I want my money to go to food for families. "Save the children" is a recommended charity to this end but the internet tells me they will spam my inbox and sell my number.
