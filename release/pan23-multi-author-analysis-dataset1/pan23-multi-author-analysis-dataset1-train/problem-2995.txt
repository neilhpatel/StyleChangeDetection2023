So don’t sweat it, just make the corrections because the judgment won’t be effective under the DLR u til you correct this. It may also come up later when you file the certificate of dissolution at the county clerks office, they might catch the error and then resettling the judgment, and amending all those papers, is more difficult and time consuming.
Aha! Seems like the upstate vs downstate distinction is the differentiator. The idea of a helpful court clerk (much less one that actually answers their phone), is a foreign concept down here in NYC.
Uncontested mats get amended informally constantly. Usually a law clerk/court attorney will send out a missing doc letter and ask for clarified. Even a contested mat with this error will be asked to conform by the court if there’s a discrepancy. It does happen a lot—not just with the civil v religious, but also date of marriage (lots forget the correct year… lol). The OP can just amend by redoing the compliant, title it amended complaint, and filing it with the clerk. Serve the defendant, but it sounds like the defendant caught the mistake and he’ll probably just sign the defendant’s affidavit. Very informal at this stage for OP. It gets much more involved after the JOD/FOF are signed.
