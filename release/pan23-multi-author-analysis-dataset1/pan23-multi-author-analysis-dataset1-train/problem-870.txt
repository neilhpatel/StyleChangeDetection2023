I get what you’re saying, and maybe it’s just a semantic difference, but to me there’s a huge distinction between buying a studio that already caters specifically to your platform, and buying a publisher with a massive IP library that’s well established on your competitor’s platform.
Good-ish, I guess. I mean it’s a win for consumers but Kotick will still be head of the company(and he’s got a lotta ties to Right-Wing Oligarchs) and the company as it stands is a septic tank of feces. Also can they also look at the Albertsons/Kroger buyout!?
So, basically you have a deal, that although huge in the industry, doesn't give Microsoft a monopoly, doesn't make Microsoft the market share leader, and they use less predatory business practices with their current property than their closest competitors.
MLB The Show is on every console. Most modern Sony first party titles (since the PS4 era) have or will.
Sony is the lead because they make a better console and better first party games. Microsoft making no effort to excel in either of those areas. Instead, they’re trying to purchase content exclusivity. They bought Zenimax so they can eventually starve Sony of access to Bethesda games. This BlizzAc merger was an attempt to further restrict Sony’s access to popular 3rd-party content.
