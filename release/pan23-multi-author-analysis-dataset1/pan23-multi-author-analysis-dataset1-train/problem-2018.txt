By some period estimates, it took as long as two years for a man to become a solid and dependable line infantryman. For cavalry and artillery the estimate was different, and artillery remained for a long time the only branch that had anything like a regularized training program for their men, usually at private or state military academies. Experience, of course, doesn't mean solely time in combat, but time on campaign, time in-service, time drilling and all the other mechanics of war. All of these are important, of course, but experience with the chaos of battle was by a wide margin the most important. Nothing can prepare a man who'd never before been shot at except the act itself.
As such, the enduring advantage of veterans remained largely practical and psychological. Men who had experienced combat before were simply better prepared to deal with combat again. You are more efficient at fighting and killing, not because of any particular tactical insight gained, but rather because you are far less likely to panic, disobey orders, shirk, or otherwise be shaken in the midst of battle. You are less likely to balk when advancing over dead men in columns, for example, or become inconsolable when a cannonball annihilates the man next to you. Furthermore, you have the proven psychological and physical tenacity to perform, as Keegan explains, the main duty of the Napoleonic infantryman: holding or taking ground despite whatever is thrown your way. As Wellinon himself once told Halkett, who was asking for relief for his infantry brigade, “Tell him what he asks is impossible: he and I, and every Englishman on the field, must die on the spot we now occupy.”.
