"Fragging", or the attempted injuring or killing of one's own officer(s) and NCOs, is definitely one of those things that sticks in people's minds about the Vietnam War. Pinning down an exact number of fragging attempts is nearly impossible. There were likely attempts which failed and no one knew, attempts unreported, and successful ones that were not identified as such. Estimates for incidents seem to vary, but the most cited places it at 800 fragging incidents for the period of 1969-1972, with the height in 1971, where there were 1.8 assaults with explosives on officers per 1,000 servicemen in theater. Some go higher, but certainly less than 100 officer/NCO deaths are attributed to suspected fragging incidents. Whether or not you consider that to be widespread is, I guess, a matter of perspective, but it certainly fits within the popular image of the military in Vietnam and the breakdown of discipline and morale that captures the popular imagination.
My apologies. Rereading it, I got the understanding. I read "Captains were the most likely target in the officer corps... while the fresh-faced LT was the NCO most visible in controlling the day-to-day.".
