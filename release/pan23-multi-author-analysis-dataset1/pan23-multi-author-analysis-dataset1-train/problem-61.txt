What has to be kept in mind here is that “performance” is very relative. In war, the situation is fluid and tactics and strategies are constantly being renegotiated in the face of new challenges – including tactics and strategies of the opposing forces, new technologies designed to counter your current tactics and strategy, and so on. To demonstrate this I have two charts.
Another was a diesel-electric submarine with a high-capacity battery, also highly streamlined. These were the Type XXI and XXIII, which were built in greater numbers than the Walter U-boats. However, they entered service right at the end of the war, and only two went on combat patrols (neither sank any ships). The Type XXI and XXIII would be highly influential to post-war submarine design.
I should also mention that there were significant improvements between WWI and WWII U-boats in areas beyond the overall design. Torpedoes were developed with pattern-running systems (FaT and LuT), which allowed for a greater hit probability when fired against a convoy. Late in the war, acoustic homing torpedoes were developed mostly for use against convoy escorts. Countermeasures like Bold allowed the U-boats to dispense fake targets for Allied sonar. And rubber hull coatings (the ultimately unsuccessful Alberich) reduced the probability of detection via active sonar. By the end of the war, most Type VII and IX U-boats were fitted with substantial anti-aircraft armament, although this was not of much practical use (the Type XXI had only minimal, remote controlled 20-mm cannon). Radar also helped U-boats find their targets, and the Type IXD2 were fitted with Fa 330 towed autogyros to extend their range of vision (however, these were seldomly used and only in the remote South Atlantic and Indian Oceans).
