It's still not quite so straightforward as the early quantity theorists assumed. Europe's inflation rate in the "long" 16th century (an average 1Â½% or so) would today generally be considered healthy and even helpful in stimulating demand (deflation having been the greater economic woe of most of the intervening period): it just broke then on an economy ill-equipped to absorb the windfall productively.
Though prices had been rising for most of the century (even before the arrival of Peru's bounty), Europe had never experienced anything like the "price revolution": past monetary woes had owed more to the currency debasement you mention, so it wasn't irrational to imagine abundant silver and a strong currency (which Spain maintained for three centuries, bequeathing us the dollar and yuan) as a guarantor of stability, prosperity and sound state finances, without foreseeing the impact of greatly increased minting.
Thanks for the answer. It's fascinating that it took us so long to figure out inflation and yet these days one can understand it after a minute or two of explanation.
