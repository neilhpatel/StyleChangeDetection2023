Mining wasn't the best alternative career to farming--that was milling. But it nevertheless attracted a decent number of the rural teenagers and young adults who chose to leave their village in search of...well, the typical explanation is that women would work to earn a larger dowry, and men, to earn enough money to be their share of establishing a household. (Women were not miners; however, if evidence of women as petty laborers surrounding the actual construction part of medieval construction sites can be a sign, they might have worked around mines as well.).
Allen's "The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective" goes in detail about quite a bit of the processes involved: from how the growth of the city of London drove both demand for coal and supplied an environment where the changes to housing could take place, to the development of coke in iron production and the use of steam engines.
The further massive growth in coal production in the 18th century was driven both by further urbanization, more of the population working in manufacturing than ever before, as well as further new uses for coal. In terms of urbanization, while the majority of urbanization before this took place in London, other cities in England rapidly grew in the 18th century, and building techniques and coal consumption in heating continued to spread throughout the country.
Finally, "Urban Growth in Early Modern England: Food, Fuel and Transport" by Wrigely has numbers on British urbanization as well as an overview of fuel usage.
