OK, so gotta stick a disclaimer on here. Two, if anything. The first is that generally, we don't mod where we post. It is bad form. I had no intention of answering this question Monday though, so I obviously was active, as you can see. Nothing removed really came remotely close to an answer, the closest being a quote from a primary source, one which I'll touch on myself, but falls quite short as it still doesn't actually say what he was doing! I'm answering it now, but have no part in its approval, which other mods will look over it to give, or deny. But anyways, as with a question that sits around and spurs curiosity, I did decide to do some research on this, and had wanted to answer it Tuesday, once it was clear the thread was dropping so that I'd feel no conflict of interest remained, but my early search for sources suggested the source I needed was not available as an ebook, so it was only this morning that the request I put in with the library got me the scan of the chapter I needed. So, with that all out of the way...
I have decided, due to the date discrepancy and the logistics of distilled alcohol killing a man while only singing the hairs of the tinkerer, it seems like he was keen on accidentally blowing stuff up and there was some separate case that actually killed his Master of Horse.
Rudolf hardly was just a sponsor either. He didn't merely leave those he supported to work, eagerly reading reports they provided him, and he would often visit them at work. As his 1591 accident attests, he was eager to tinker himself, and would get his hands dirty, which to observers, if on the one hand evidence for his "amazing knowledge of all things", also a source of great criticism that he had "transformed his seat from the imperial throne to the workshop stool." It wasn't just alchemy that he did himself either, as making clocks also became a favorite past time, even if regarded as well below his station by others.
