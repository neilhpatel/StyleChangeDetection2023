This just unadulterated madness. Especially in the age of cell phones. IThe Iranian regime doesn't give a fuck!
There are religions today and historically with practices of cannibalism, human sacrifice, genital mutilation and fellating the elders.
Thank you ♥️. This is the Iran my parents grew up in. It was by no means a utopia, they had problems just like any other country. But it was a live able country. A fun one to visit and one you could be proud to be from.
My comment is not to glorify atheistic Communism or to absolve them of their crimes in their past, but out of all the social, economic and political ideologies humanity has manage to drum up for the last 15,000 of our existence in Earth, Communism isn’t the worst of them in regards to Return-On-Investments.
But no more. If my people are out in the streets fighting and dying, the least I could do is talk about it and deliver their message. Fuck this regime. Fuck what they've done to our people. Fuck what they've done to our perception across the globe. Fuck them for getting rich while they beat the blood for the poor.
