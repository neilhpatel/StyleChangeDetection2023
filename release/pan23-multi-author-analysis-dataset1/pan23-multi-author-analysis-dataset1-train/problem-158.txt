If you fail to understand the supposed violation (make them be specific with respect to what exactly you violated and the potential penalties involved), and your rights throughout the disciplinary process, you will have a substantially increased risk of losing the hearing, missing out on any appeals, or missing out on lesser disciplinary penalties.
Thanks. When I talked to my dad after making this post, he said the same thing about how long it must’ve been up there. The email just said “barcode” so I don’t know if there was anything attached.
The email just said “barcode,” not package. It didn’t even say what kind of product it was for. I don’t even know if a barcode would have the product name on it (or even the store name).
Would the barcode have the product or store name on it? That’s the only explanation I can think of for how they’d know it was a marijuana product (they never even said it was weed, just a “marijuana product”). That or the rest of the package was there, and the email only said it was a barcode.
