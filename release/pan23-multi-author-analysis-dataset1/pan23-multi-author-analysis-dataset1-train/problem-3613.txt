Republicans spend all day ragging on universities and their useless liberal arts degree and what does this Republican have a degree in? Liberal Studies.
And I'm sure he's lying. But they can't prove that. Especially when his actual major was Liberal Studies, which is so generic that it's plausible that he did mostly take Political Science and International Relations classes, but not enough to qualify for the major.
Lmfao. Imagine saying this during a background check for a new job. "Oh, I just assumed I graduated with the relevant degree for the position I was applying for.".
There have been many Dems that were convicted of crimes that were certainly buttressed by lies but that shouldn't be used to condemn all Dems as criminals and liars yet I find myself labeling all Repugs as either psychopathic liars or those actively seeking to buttress the crimes and lies of the majority.
The test could be optional. It wouldn't be disqualifying per se, but those who fail to take it would receive a '0', which would be shared along with the 5 items listed in the above comment.
