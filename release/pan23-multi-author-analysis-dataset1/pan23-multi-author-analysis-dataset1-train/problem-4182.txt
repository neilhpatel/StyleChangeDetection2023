I understand sometimes the defendants cannot pay what is asked, but after the incident(I saw he lives in a fairly modest house) I would like to proceed with whatever charges I can since this has ruined a huge set of my summer plans for June/July!
Did you have the check? If you have the check then you have your answer. I think I mentioned mitigation previously? You have a duty to mitigate your damages and in this case the rent. Your life might be busy, but you need to buy a car.
He had insurance & I initially made a claim with them but opted to cancel it since they were giving lackluster assistance & absolute minimal coverage for my repairs to my vehicle(whereas my insurance is totaling the vehicle).
Once you have the check, that's it. If you want to play out and get a better deal, that's on your dime. Getting the other insurance company to review and total your vehicle is a pain because they have to get it from the other vendors tow yard etc. It takes days to process and hours of the adjustors time. You maybe refused.
I’m not sure how much I can get from my insurance company either but if there is anything I can do to help recover any of the charges I’m facing/going to face I want to take advantage of this, as I am not in a great financial place to begin with & this is a brand new process to me!
That's as much as I can say. The only other advice is to say - You might have to make the decision you need to make verses the one you're happy about. If you want to hold out, it'll be a pain and you'll need to give yourself more time somehow.
