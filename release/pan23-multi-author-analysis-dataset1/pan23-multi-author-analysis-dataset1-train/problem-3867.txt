>The largest recorded starquake was detected on December 27, 2004 from the ultracompact stellar corpse SGR 1806-20.[15] It has been calculated that the energy release would be equivalent to a magnitude 32 quake on Earth.[16] The quake, which occurred 50,000 light years from Earth, released gamma rays equivalent to 1037 kW. Had it occurred within a distance of 10 light years from Earth, the quake could have triggered a mass extinction.[17].
Intentionally curl-tailing any efforts to make more use of resources already available makes the supply problem worse, as well as shutting down unionization efforts which limits the number of buyers who otherwise compete with each other, which increases how much a worker makes.
Where is he in Turkey ? Because the heart of the devastation is in the south east of the country, near the Syrian border. Chances are your friend is in the most tourist-y areas near Istanbul on the other side of the country, no ?
Resources are ultimately finite. A larger pool of people fighting for the same finite resources will deplete the supply of those resources, as well as cause demand to increase compared to the available supply. Naturally, there's no real way to address this problem without some malevolent jackass deciding that the problem is specifically <racial/ethnic demographic they don't like.
Absolutely incorrect. Adding population is one of the most reliable ways to grow an economy, assuming they can be utilized. The bigger problem in Turkey is the rampant corruption and oligarchy which keeps people poor.
