Under the ADA, you ask for the accommodation that leaves you able to perform your job. The employer needs to accommodate that request unless they argue that doing so is more than a reasonable burden. Only working day shifts is a challenging request in many jobs. No one wants to work nights.
If your medicine legitimately (as in, your doctor and the medical literature support this) makes you unable to stay awake, do work safely, or something like that, and you can't adjust when you take the meds or the dosage, then asking to not be scheduled for night shifts is a reasonable accommodation request and a corporate retailer like Dollar Tree will have a hard time claiming it's unreasonable or a hardship for them to accommodate you.
Yea I get you. I believe my doctor would back me on this as the lyrica is specifically taken at night. But to be frank, the hiring manager knew and understood I was disabled, took medicine and did not want nights. It was mentioned during the application and interview. During the application they ask what hours and days and the reasons for why you can't work the other hours. They had to have read that stuff before contacting me. Or at least you'd think they would.
