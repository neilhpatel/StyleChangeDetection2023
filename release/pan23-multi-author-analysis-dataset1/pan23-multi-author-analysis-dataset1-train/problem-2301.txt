Bottom line is the card issuer doesn't care who spent the money, they will recoup it regardless. And they will pay after a court proceeding to collect on it. Since your mom is basically uncollectable in the eyes of the law, meaning she doesn't have an income source that you could garnish even if you did win a judgment against her, you just better make sure she doesn't open or hasn't opened any other accounts, at the least, and press charges against her for identity theft to try and get the card issuer to relinquish the responsibility you have to repay the debt at most.
3. Great idea by ClammyJuice - Tell your mom you're going to suspend rent payments and use that money to eliminate the debt. (You cannot allow her to agree to pay off the card as long as she is allowed to use it. She will continue to run it up. YOU'RE going to get stuck with this bill eventually and you're better off paying $7,000 now than $11,000 a year from now.).
1. Freeze your credit with every agency. (keep your PINs in a safe place as you'll need them when you want to finance something.).
2. Get a copy of your credit from every agency. Look it over closely for other open, active accounts and how much damage has been done.
