By no means does that mean $2 million is reasonable, and perhaps some of the documented expense can be removed from the case due to preexisting conditions, however that is the job for an attorney.
Right? Or even a really bad car crash with 3 people in the same car I thought 100k was low and I have been confronted with the fact that 100k is not even close to the lowest rung of the insurance limbo apparatus. Crazy!
Once the likely amount exceeds the coverage limits, the insurance company's interests and the insured's interests start to deviate, creating a conflict of interest for the insurance-provided attorney.
Oh true. I was just thinking property damage. Medical liability insurance is a part of the car registration in my country, so everyone has that and insurance is just for property, and typically $20m+.
Okay okay okay okay okay okay. Got it. Thank you for all your wonderful and detailed and very patient comments kindly explaining how insurance coverage works.
