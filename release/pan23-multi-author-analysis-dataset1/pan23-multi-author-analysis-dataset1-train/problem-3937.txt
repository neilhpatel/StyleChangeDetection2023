Your SO created a liability issue by discharging mace in a closed environment. She should have just called the police. She violated policy and will be lucky if none of the other patrons file complaints. She would not win a suit.
I understand your frustration here, but I want to push back on it being “upholding the letter of the law,” companies have these rules in place for good reason, if the employees get involved and get hurt the company now has liability. The company’s duty is to protect its employees, which it is trying to do with such a policy. A very common policy that people always get upset about is that bank tellers are nearly universally told to simply hand over cash if robbed and to not fight back at all. There have been cases where bank employees have subdued robbers and been fired. The reason is that if instead of subduing the robber they had been hurt the company would be on the hook for that, they enforce the policy to discourage others from following suit and being unlucky. The same applies here, your SO was lucky in that the result wasn’t an injury. Again, I understand the frustration, but this isn’t just a letter of the law situation, there is good reason for such policies.
