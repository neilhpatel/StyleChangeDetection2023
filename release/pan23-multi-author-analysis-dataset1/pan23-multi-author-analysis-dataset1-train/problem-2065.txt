According to other Democratic Senators Sinema rarely shows up at caucus meetings anyways and she often refuses to communicate with leadership. She is only willing to work with a couple democratic senators. She has told people that Democrats made her feel unwelcome. Meanwhile she calls McConnell her friend. According to one staffer Sinema shows up at negotiations unwilling to bend for colleagues but will negotiate with Republicans.
Yep. This entire stunt strikes me as Sinema trying to set it up so that she can run as an Independent, expecting to peel off even just a few points from Democrats and hand the election to republicans. Really awful thing to do.
If they nominate another crazy MAGAnut or Democrats boost the Republican MAGAnut then some Republicans would surely go for Independent Sinema.
Yeah. It looks like the national Democrats (leadership, I meanâ€¦the progressives are out for blood) are going along with it and playing nice for now. No way to predict what Arizona Democrats are going to do.
