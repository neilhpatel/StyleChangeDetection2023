You're right that the system isn't perfect and could be improved. That's probably always true, everywhere. But clearly what's happening here is that a coalition of criminals has taken power and they're trying to destroy the legislative with a very shortsighted view to bypass their own criminality. If by making a case for judicial reform you're suggesting that there's any good faith desire from the government for proper reforms, I think the issue quickly becomes a lot less nuanced and complex: there isn't. This is bad and should be stopped.
Israel doesn’t have a constitution to delineate the line between legislative & judicial authority like the US does.
So where there are checks & balances between the legislative & judicial branches of the US government; the Israeli system definitely allows the Supreme Court to have too much power for an unelected body.
In the US, courts are limited in their powers of review to address only the question of whether or not a law passed by Congress is constitutional, if it isn’t a constitutional question, then the courts can’t overrule Congress.
Without a constitution, allowing the parliament to override the courts with a simple majority is an over correction that swings the balance of power too far towards parliament, so a middle ground needs to be found.
Off the top of my head, even making it so only a supermajority of parliament could override the court would be an improvement but even that might not strike the correct balance.
