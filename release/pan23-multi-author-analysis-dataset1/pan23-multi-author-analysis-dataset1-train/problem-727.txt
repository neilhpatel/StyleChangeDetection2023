E: make sure you are logged into UK area on vpn BEFORE opening the web browser and searching for bbc itv. It must recognize your location to work.
I should also say that I can't think I've ever spoken to a football fan who thinks that opening ceremonies are anything other than a time wasting distraction which more often than not only serves to lead you into screaming 'get on with the fucking game' after you've lost the will to live enduring one and wishing it to finish.
Just email n signup. Fake name or whatever. They don’t ask for addy when signing up for bbc account. Least i remember. Or just Google one.
Good, after the FIFA boss's insane rant that pissed off the left for trying to deflect from the horrible stuff Qatar does (seriously, slave labour) and the right by spreading hate speech and false statements about Europeans and their history in an horrible attempt of whataboutism, no one should watch this shit show or cover it in a neutral light.
I use express vpn. Because it’s the one I’ve had for a few years. Never had any issues. Can connect all devices. Sure a bit pricey ($100/year) but been worth it.
