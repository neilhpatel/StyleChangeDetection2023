Whether she wins the Republican primary or not, the scary thing is that the district is Republican-leaning and that specific seat being vacant (and not filled by a Republican) is the only thing keeping Wisconsin Republicans from having 2/3 in the State Legislature in both chambers.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Getting a 2/3 in both allows them on party-lines to over-ride any Governor's veto, and to also impeach and remove(since Senate needs 2/3 to uphold an impeachment) the Governor, or even State Supreme Court judges (which could be key if the voters elect the liberal candidate and flip the majority from Conservatives to Liberals).
That makes her mainstream. A Rogue Republican would be one that intentionally tells the truth and has their voters' best interests in mind. They don't exist except in the history books, and the mainstream calls them RINOs. Even the wildly corrupt and White Christian Nationalist Reagan is a RINO now.
