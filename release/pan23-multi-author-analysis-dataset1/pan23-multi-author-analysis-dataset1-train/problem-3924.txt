The vast majority of European Jews try one of the above “solutions,” however, a small group of Jews takes another approach. Hoping that some form of autonomy will be a solution to the Jewish problem a small group of Jews in the Russian empire begins to advocate a return to a land they see as their ancestral home, Palestine. At this point, Palestine is part of the Ottoman Empire, a multiethnic empire which, until at least 1908 largely rejects the framework of European nationalism. So while Palestine’s population at this point is mostly people who speak Arabic, they don’t necessarily see themselves as Arab, rather as Muslims in the Ottoman empire (there were also Jews and Christians in Palestine but less). This description of identity in the Ottoman Empire something of an oversimplification, and my point isn’t to say that some people living in Palestine had formed a sort of Palestinian identity, just that Palestine at this point wasn’t an independent state, and national identity was not the major vector of identity.
We're on AH, we like that sort of thing. I've already got a backlog of a hundred-plus, what's a few more books to add to that pile? Open the floodgates and never mind how difficult they are.
