The Olympics events and the general system is good. It's the invitees that should not be from coutries actively destroying the conditions for Ukrainian (or another group) life like denying them electricity, water, and heat through repeated missile attacks. That's a pretty high bar, most will be able to participate.
ok and what about the 2003 Iraq invasion under the false premise that saddam had WMDs, the bombing of Cambodia, the civilian bombing of Serbia, intervention in the vietnamese civil war where bioweapons were used ( which are still in effect to this day ), the two operations which involved killing cuban citizens in order to destabilize Cuba, the intervention im Afghanistan and the list goes on.
There is nothing to dress up. Itâ€™s a historical fact that the US did not invade Vietnam. They came to the aid of the South Vietnamese government.
The 2 year alternating schedule is too frequent to make the games impactful (I've barely watched the last few), and it encourages the ridiculous constant building of unnecessary infrastructure and the bloated, corrupt bidding process that often leads to host cities spending billions they don't have on massive budget overruns with minimal support from the IOC.
Pointing out hypocrisy isn't whataboutism nor does it make you a russian troll. You can bring up western hypocrisy AND oppose russia, the two aren't mutually exclusive.
