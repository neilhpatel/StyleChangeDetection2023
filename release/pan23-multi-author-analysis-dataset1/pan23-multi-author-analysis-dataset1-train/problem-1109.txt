We lost the House, not Congress. And the GOP will have a razor-thin margin there, and there's a lot of infighting among factions. And, just like Donald McEachin (D-VA) just died of cancer, and Jackie Walorski (R-IN) died in August in a car wreck, a few deaths or severe health issues in the GOP could result in a Democratic majority yet again. Unexpected deaths notwithstanding, it's going to be a circus, and some vulnerable Republicans aren't going to stand for it. There's a possibility we could end up with someone reasonable as Speaker if McCarthy can't get his caucus to line up behind him. Meanwhile, in the Democratic Senate, they can still confirm Biden's nominees, and hold hearings the proper way, as a contrast to the craziness the House is bound to be.

Hypothetical question. Would you prefer a Republican over Sinema if that Republican was contractually bound to vote with the democratic party on 93% of votes?
