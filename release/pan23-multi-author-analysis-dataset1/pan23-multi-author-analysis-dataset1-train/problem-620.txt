I literally support equality? How are we tagging myself as a sexist for asking a question? I mean genuinely wtf. I have always been an advocate for equal rights. So much for civil conversation on this app.
Like personally I'd argue for "just fucking letting it be recognized as law" since frankly I can't see any downside even with the complicated procedural questions for ratification, but it will probably come down to what the SCOTUS thinks, and at that point, the decision could involve some weird procedural nitty -gritty rather than whether or not the amendment is good or not.
As a woman who has worked with vets with PTSD (male and female). Who is married to a vet. Whose best friend is a female vet. Who cares? Equal rights mean equal responsibilities, and the draft would be fine with every woman young or old who I have talked to about this.
