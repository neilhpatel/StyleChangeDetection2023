What your perspective might be lacking is knowledge of how boarding schools changed over the decades. You'll notice many of the worst statistics I cited above came before 1900, and certainly before the Meriam Report was published in 1928. The first break point coincides with a gradual shift from strict assimilation ideals of the schools. Richard Pratt originally thought he could extinguish indigenous languages and cultures in one generation. By 1900 those goals were obviously not reached, and the horrors of the schools increasingly became known outside of indigenous communities. Zitkála-Šá's articles written for Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Monthly between 1900 and 1902 detailed, for a national progressive white audience, the trauma of boarding schools both as a student and a teacher. A rising core of Native American intellectuals, many educated at the boarding schools, began coalescing around the turn of the century, vocally advocating for change, and eventually founded the Society of American Indians in 1911. Part of their platform advocated nationally for better conditions for indigenous Americans, including school reform. [Edit: Also, in the 1900s the Bureau of Indian Affairs established sanitarium schools for students with tuberculosis, removing them as a source of potential infections from the larger student population.].
My point is that for the administrators of the program itself, the incompetence and malicious abuse weren't issues with the system. They didn't need to be addressed because they weren't slowing down the progress of taking Indigenous kids away from families and returning broken, pseudo-white people to society.
