The amount of "big" warheads outside of the unitary 1mt GLBM warheads is actually quite small for the Russian stockpile.
On a per missile basis in the real world a Russian MIRV is barely better than a unitary missile and a unitary warhead is about a third to a half the kilotons of an American version.
So while individually we do not employ single unitary warheads(pretty much at all outside of cruise) our missiles actually have more megatons per launch. Both the LGM-30 and the Trident 2 can carry more live warheads over decoys compared to Russian SLBMs or even their newer GLBM prototype.
Celebrating making a missile that is worse than a Trident in every possible way while ignoring that the direct comparison is an LGM-30 which is over twice as destructive, more accurate, and can engage more targets at once.
China is a creeping fungus putting their mycelial roots in all of us. Slowly draining our lifeblood.
Incorrect. The size of our warheads has shrunk because we adapted a different strategy for use. Namely MIRVs and calculated overlap to enhance certain effects involving overpressure.
