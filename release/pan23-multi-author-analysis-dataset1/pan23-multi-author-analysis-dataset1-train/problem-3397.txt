The fed gov’t getting involved w their lawyers is no longer enough to institute change, in fact it just seems to enrage the police even more such that they protest on the job. We need real action by legislators, and that action needs to be backed by a well funded federal enforcement mechanism. You leave it up to the states to do reform, like they left the PPP money or Biden’s infrastructure bill, ain’t shit happening.

Soldiers are not automatically bloodthirsty barbarians. But here in America there is a prevalent belief in toxic masculinity, and those who buy into the idea tend to seek out occupations where violence is an option - such as police work and the military.
Pshh. Just like the Portland cops are still under a federal indictment, years after the original lawsuit, and still they are not abiding by what the DOJ demanded. They’re about to get sued for like the fifth time.
