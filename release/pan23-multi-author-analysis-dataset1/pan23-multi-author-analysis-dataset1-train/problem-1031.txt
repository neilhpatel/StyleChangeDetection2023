It’s an odd song. Wikipedia suggests (and is usually right about this kind of thing) that ‘The Real Slim Shady’ was released in April 2000, barely a year after ‘My Name Is’, Eminem’s breakthrough single (released in January 1999). In that time period, as far as I can tell, I don’t think very many white rappers emerged, who one might describe as the ‘fake Slim Shadys’ that Eminem spends much of the song railing against.
Instead, ‘The Real Slim Shady’ is best seen more as one big boast: ‘I’m so successful, everyone is trying to imitate me!’, and as yet another Eminem song focusing on authenticity. Eminem was well aware of his fairly weak claim to hip-hop authenticity, being a white guy who didn’t grow up selling drugs in the Bronx, or whatever. Many of his moves - working with Dr. Dre, the meant-to-appear-semi-autobiographical 8 Mile movie, the gleefully rude/in-bad-taste lyrics - were trying very hard to establish authenticity (all the while writing lyrics with deliberately unreliable narrators, a centuries-old poetic device, and while prominently having this odd tripartite personality, where some tracks/albums were Marshall Mathers, some were Eminem and some were Slim Shady.) And saying he’s the ‘Real’ Slim Shady is simply another way to establish his bona fide claim to his particular corner of hip hop.
Interesting! Tbh I assumed it was more about kids copying him and beyond that a sort of not-very-serious claim to be somehow the authentic example of a certain type (sort of class clown but angrier, antisocial and irreverent, working class maybe 'white trash' [I don't really get American class categories]). Which is more about celebrating the type (which many of his fans identified as even if they're now stockbrokers) than criticsing other artists.
