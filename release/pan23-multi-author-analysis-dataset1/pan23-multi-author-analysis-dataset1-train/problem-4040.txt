Non-competes can be difficult to enforce but the lawsuits can be expensive to defend. Judges in many states (I am not sure about Alaska) employ a series of factors to assess the fairness and enforceability of the non-compete. Issues such as your position within the former employer (i.e. were you a lowly employee or did you have a significant role), access to confidential information that could be taken elsewhere (generally something more than just customer lists which are often widely known in some industries), and the lenh and geographic scope of the non-compete (75 mile radius may seem small in Alaska but if it is the entire island where you live it is a bigger deal).
NAL but I am a PT. Yes to all of the above. Non competes are intended to prevent you from working for a competitor and poaching clients/ referral sources and are notoriously hard to reinforce. I would definitely ask them to release you from it.
If they did choose to pursue it, you have good arguments that the provision is not enforceable and against public policy because (a) it unduly restrains your ability to earn a living, (b) goes beyond protecting their legitimate interests (they let you go), and (c) is against public policy including because it interferes with the ability of patients on the isolated island to receive appropriate medical care.
