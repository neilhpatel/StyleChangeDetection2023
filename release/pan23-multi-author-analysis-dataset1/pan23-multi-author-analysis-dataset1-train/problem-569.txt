The video being circulated since yesterday of the dozen Russians who get gunned down while surrendering because their comrade started shooting at the Ukrainians shows that surrendering isn't always an easy option. If you're being shelled or bombed you can't really surrender, either. Deserters are shot on sight if spotted by Russia. It's a tenuous situation, not as easy as just waving a while flag and getting a free meal. I don't agree with Russia but also see a lot of these kids being forced to fight don't have a lot of good options. Fuck Putin.
I have sympathy for those that didn't choose to be there (and still some sympathy for those that did due to brainwashing and propaganda), but all citizens in a state bear some degree of culpability with the actions of their government. Putin and the oligarchs are only able to rule as authoritarians because so much of their citizenry are disengaged or apathetic to politics.
Bad luck. They had plenty of time to fuck off Putin, to flee the war, and to prevent all of this bullshit.
