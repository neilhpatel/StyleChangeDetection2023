In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
To think. The laws and rules of the country, can change just like that. At least with a dictator, you know where to assign blame. Here, do I blame the 40M voters that actually wanted this? Wanted to disband democracy?
Negative. There are more Republican controlled legislatures than Democrat. The theory behind ISL is the state legislatures can control the POTUS electors, regardless of how the citizens vote, and throw out their states choice for POTUS. The loophole can go even farther, saying that the legislature controls ALL elections, and can override position being voted in. That last part is the end goal: You can still "vote" but it won't matter.
