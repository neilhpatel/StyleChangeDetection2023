I understand but before you start throwing things out you need to know you’re not going after just the dealer, you’re practically going after Ford. In my experience get all your ducks in a row and pretty much hope they can reimburse you a bit than cut your losses, it sucks I know but these events rarely play out, as far as the repair taking to long that never works because the amount of excuses IE “ parts took forever “ “ we’re backed up “ etc etc you’ll hear it all.
Take it home, put a new battery in it. If that doesnt solve the issue then you will need to have it diagnosed. The stuff they are telling you about there being a low voltage code before, thats 100% legit. Many cars store codes and time/date stamp them and not all codes will throw a light on your dash. It can be throwing a low voltage code without you knowing it because it wasnt enough to cause an issue yet. That also indicates its a battery issue and not alternator. Your car having \60k miles and a few years old means its at the early side of potentially needing a replacement battery but not out of the normal. Having the car in the shop and not being driven regularly can accelerate the need for a battery due to less frequent charging.
