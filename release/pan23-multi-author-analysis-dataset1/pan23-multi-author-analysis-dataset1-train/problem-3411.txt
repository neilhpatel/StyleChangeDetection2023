If you have never missed a payment and have indeed paid the full 9000 you can leave November 30th as per your lease states. In some cases you can move out as long as the full amount of the term is paid. However if you still have property there after December 1st he can charge you rent because you're still technically "present" in regards to the property. Now like I said before if you haven't missed a payment, not only can you move out but if he withholds your deposit and there is no damage left take him to small claims and get your deposit back since I'm assuming most landlord's at the very least do one months rent for a deposit. Sometimes first and last months. He's trying to play you if he charges anything outside of these terms.
Be sure to check your lease for how many days you need to give notice… I didn’t do this and it was 90 days and I thought it was 30 and the wording on my lease said if we don’t give the 90 days the lease the ups for another 2 years at a 75$ increase… it got me stuck the last two years at the old house we rented that was literally falling down (seriously had a 2x4 holding up our sinking sink)…. Wish I’d known about this pace to ask advice back then We are out and in an apt now… more rent but less stress.
