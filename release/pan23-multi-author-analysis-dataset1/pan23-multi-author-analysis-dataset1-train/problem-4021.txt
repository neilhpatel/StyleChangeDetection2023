If you end up not getting a response after a day or two, consider asking a new question focusing instead on why what happened did happen (rather than why what didn't happen didn't happen) - this kind of question is more likely to get a response in our experience. Hope this helps!
Therefore, as the British colonies in Canada entered the nineteenth century they were tied to the British crown by loyalty, a shared language and institutions, and, in the case of Quebec, constitutional convenience. While all of these colonies would experience their own growing pains - including small \- Canada would never have cause to fundamentally reconsider its relationship with Britain.
There are a few potential angles to this question - do you mean why did the British colonies in (what is now) Canada join the American Revolution in 1775-1783? Or why was there never a "Canadian Revolution"? Or, more broadly speaking, what was different about Canadian society that made it that much less revolutionary and/or loyal to Britain? For the sake of brevity, let's consider the former to be the main thrust of your question - although we can touch on parts two and three as well!
