Warnock ran a great campaign but Georgia is FAR from a blue state. There is every reason to believe that his seat would go red if he left it. Him in it right now means thats one less seat that Democrats have to worry about for the next 6 years. 2024 is not looking good for Democrats when it comes to the Senate as they have way more competitive or worse seats coming up. Winning this helps give them the tiniest of ledges to cling onto.
I am highly critical of Christianity, quite vocally opposed, and my beefs are with the entire belief system itself, but I respect good Christians who actually practice the religion as a way of life, the way Jesus taught it in the bible, and who donâ€™t wear it as cultural paint.
Major \\\ on 4 times in two years. The general and runoff are 1 election, that are stretched over two separate days. No one would say Sen. Alex Pedilla won two elections in 1 year because he technically won two different races in the midterms (one for a 6 year term, and another to finish out Kamala Harris' term).
