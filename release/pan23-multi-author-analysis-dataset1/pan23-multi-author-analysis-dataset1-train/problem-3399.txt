1. I believe that pit bulls are still outlawed in Miami. If you’re in Miami, then these neighbors can’t own these dogs. Report to Code Enforcement/similar entity.
We go to the post office ourselves and pick it up. Today the cops were called over the dead cat but they couldn’t do anything about the dogs without animal control. The post office knows about this situation too but do nothing about it because, exact quote “our postwoman hasn’t been bitten yet”. They suggested we file for a dangerous dog case with 3-1-1 but considering how helpful 3-1-1 has been in the past, it probably won’t help at all. We have contacted 3-1-1 several times over the neighbors, however with the dogs they just told us to contact animal control. These neighbors get away with a lot of other stuff too such as having mountains of trash in their front lawn and doing nothing about it, which is another reason why we contacted 3-1-1 but regardless of how many times the authorities come to fine them, they just straight up do not care.
5. Do these neighbors own or rent? If they rent, call their landlord (all complaints will go to the landlord too, I believe).
