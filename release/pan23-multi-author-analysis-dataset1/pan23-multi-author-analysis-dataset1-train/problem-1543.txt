Really appreciate your engagement. Most of what I speak about is really a hangover from previous administrations and forced compromise for Biden. It will take significant effort to change the thinking. For example, I am an advocate for social programs more focused on giving people an opportunity to be self sufficient rather than a give away. Additionally having personally witnessed abuse of the PPP loan program and it's consequences, we need to be better at thinking the problem and SOLUTIONS through more carefully. Giving assistance without a commitment from the receiver to do what they are capable of doing to make their own life better not only diminishes the value of the help but also creates an environment of entitlement. Flip the script, same goes for the successful elite.

Exactly. Also it's not like he's the one doing all the actual work. He has passed a lot of great things so apparently the people he has hired are quite competent.
Democrat loyalists? Look how the news media needs Democrats to behave like Republicans to excuse their refusal to cover their crimes in earnest. Democrats are supporting Biden because he's been a good president, not because they're loyalists. Republicans accomplish things by having enough loyalists that always fall in line, and Democrats have solid plans/policies that are popular among voters and would improve lives.
