The Civil Rights Act (federal) and Unruh Civil Rights Act (Calif.) both protect against discrimination based on someone's membership in a protected class (race, religion, sex, national origin, etc.) The burden on proof lies on you to show that their action was motivated on something such as your race, rather than something like "making people uncomfortable by staring at them" or "wearing socks with sandals" or "abusing thesauruses by using one for every third word you write." (For the record, your writing style very obviously betrays the fact you do this. I feel it necessary to mention it because makes you sound much less articulate, not more. You used a bunch of words wrong, too.).
But more specifically , HOW do I PROVE a case for discrimination in the possibility that another unlawful removal or unlawful refusal of service is enforced on grounds of discrimination?
Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or youâ€™ve edited your post to comply with the rules, . Do not make a second post or comment.
