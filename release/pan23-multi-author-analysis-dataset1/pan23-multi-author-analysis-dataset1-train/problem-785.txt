A 3% annual raise for an competent IT manager? Are you serious? Dude go get your 10% elsewhere. You deserve it.
It sounds to me like the main reason you aren't getting a raise is that your new boss doesn't value you as an employee and doesn't value treating employees well, which aren't illegal reasons for any decisions that negatively impact you, such as firing you or not giving you a COLA.
To add to what others have said. It may be a good idea to write your own job description and get this schmo to approve it. Doing that and solidifying a couple references from people who aren't that dingo will help in case he decides to be scummy when you go get paid way more somewhere else and he see's how much the company just lost by treating the sole ITAdmin like a disposable toilet wipe.
Oh, and when you leave? Don't worry about giving then adequete notice, or documentation of you work beyond what you already have created, and for gods sake, if they try to get you to answer your phone after you leave, hand them a contract as a consultant. I can almost guarentee they will argue you on all these points.
