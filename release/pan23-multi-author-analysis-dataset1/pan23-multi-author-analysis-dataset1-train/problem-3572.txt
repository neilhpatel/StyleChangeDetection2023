Most leases contain a provision that states that the property has to be vacated, not merely that OP has to vacate. As in, the property has to be empty of both people and their possessions. If you think about it, it makes sense. You canâ€™t evaluate what you need to keep from the security deposit (or sue for beyond the security deposit) until everything and everyone is out of there. OP could cause water damage, move some furniture to cover it up, leave and get off the lease, and then the roommate be on the hook for damage she potentially knew nothing about. Or, the landlord would have to sue both of them as individuals and spend a lot of money litigating who owed what. It basically would destroy any benefit to the landlord of the J&S liability of the lease. No one would want to rent to unrelated roommates under that scheme because it would be too difficult to recover damages.
Unfortunately not. The only document I've signed from them is the lease, which is over in February. The early lease termination didn't require my signature and the property managers refuse to let one of us off the lease without a replacement tenant.
