First, let me clarify something about the word 'caste'. Caste is an English word, derived from Portuguese 'casta', as a catch-all term for hierarchal structures of the Indian subcontinent. What is called caste is divisible into two terms called वर्ण (varna) and जाति (jati), which are related but distinct. Varna, meaning colour, is the fourfold caste system of Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra that even foreign observers are familiar with. On the other hand, jati, meaning birth, is based on specific occupations, tribes and traditions, and there are thousands of jatis all throughout the subcontinent. A jati surname, still in use in the subcontinent, will let one specifically know the occupation of someone's ancestors. Jatis were generally distributed into varnas, although it wasn't always a clear-cut division. Examples of Jatis include Gamalla (toddy tappers), Mukkuvar (fishermen), Irular (Irula is a tribal division), Ambalavasi (temple workers) and so on.
I am still a bit dissatisfied though. Fuller doesn't seem to be indicating where he got this information from. (Is this first hand, or an ideal?). The main reason for dissatisfaction is this: Fights between karanavars of tharavadus and sambandhakkars were not rare, especially when politics was involved. This should mean the sambandhakkaran held power of some sort over the woman, while nothing I have read/heard so far seems to indicate any such power. If any, I have heard of women simply discarding the sambandhakkaran on many grounds.
