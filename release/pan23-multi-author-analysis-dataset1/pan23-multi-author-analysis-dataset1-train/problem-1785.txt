How high is your personal debt? Let's say, you got 5 $ in total left this month, do you immediately spend it? You will have nothing to eat for a few days, though. Ok, you go and take a credit somewhere. That works how often? Debt keeps piling up, and those whom you owe start getting nervous, angry even. They enforce collection of the debt - oh no, suddenly, you don't have a house anymore Oh no, no one is giving you any credit anymore Oh no, but meh - it's only made up, so you can just go on spending. Problem solved.

Sigh. Just because the currency isn’t backed by an asset like gold or silver doesn’t mean you can just do whatever the hell you want with no consequences.
