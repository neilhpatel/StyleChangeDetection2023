Here in the west, when we think of "Buddhism" we probably imagine a solemn and dark temple with rows of shaven head monks sitting earnestly in deep meditation while striving with all their might towards enlightenment. In other words our perception of Buddhism is centered on the deeper philosophical and mystical elements of the religion.
While this type of Buddhist practice certainly existed, it was not and is not the normative experience of people who are actually engaged with the religion in its Asian homeland. Depending on the particular country, the average Buddhist center will likely be a priest's family's home, a temple that largely functions as a community center, a place of devotional worship or even a museum-like tourist attraction. What you don't see hardly any of is people meditating.
Very interesting! I only have a basic sense of the various strands of Buddhist thought, but I do know that Tibetan and Zen Buddhism are the two at the top of popular consciousness in the US. Are these also the schools with the most converts in the West, or are they just well-known? And, relatedly, does the popularity of certain schools of thought in the West correspond to significant immigrant groups? Your answer mentioned Zen Buddhism a lot, and I realized that traditional practitioners of Zen are also probably over-represented in the US (especially California) compared to other schools thanks to significant Japanese immigration. Was that the nexus through which Buddhism spread, or was it more through a general interest in the exotic/Orientalism in Western intellectual circles?
