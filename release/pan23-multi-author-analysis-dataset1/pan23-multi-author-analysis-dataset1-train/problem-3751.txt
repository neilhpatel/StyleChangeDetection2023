As well, Stalin had gained fame in Bolshevik circles for his work in Georgia when he was younger, helping to organize oil workers there and in Baku (now the capital of neighbouring Azerbaijan; it was also part of the Russian Empire and later USSR). While he had stopped using his birth name of Jughashvili (or Dzhugashvili, as the Russian transliteration goes), and he was not one to promote his own ethnic background (this going contrary to socialist ideals of moving past nationalism, which was seen as a plot to keep the proletariat fighting each other, rather than the bourgeois), he also contradictory in this matter: Stalin was fond of eating Georgian food and drink, and kept some Georgians in his closer circle for quite some time (Lavrenti Beria is the most prominent, but I will note here that Beria was actually ethnically Mingrelian, which is a sub-group of Georgians; so while most non-Georgians wouldn't know or care about the difference, it was/is much more pronounced to Georgians), and was known to sometimes speak to Beria and others in Georgian; being a notoriously complex language, no one around them would understand it, so it had the benefit of maintaining secrecy.
Woah that is a very comprehensive answer. Do you have a link or any recommendations to Stalin’s views on nationalism? I often hear that he was a Russian nationalist (although that does not seem the case to me at all, regardless of Stalin’s actions). I know that in China he supported the GMD until the White Terror, but the support for nationalist was due to his belief in the Marxist conception of history.
