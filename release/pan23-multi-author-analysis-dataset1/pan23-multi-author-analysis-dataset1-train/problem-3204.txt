1994 crime bill was a doozie. Also calling Jan 6th an attempt at overthrowing the goverment is a joke with no weapons and only a few thousand people at most. The summer of love kinda made things alittle extremist more so than a broken window and a bunch of people wandering around, but you know that's way worse than 2 billion in claimed damages and ruining business owners livelihoods.
Very good post. Not many no of this. Not only was it a great call be the President, but nobody for sure knew just what was in that balloon. It could have been just about anything. Chemicals, another form of Covid-19 the list goes on and on.

Exactly. When someone tells me that Biden may have broken the law, my reaction is to say that he should be investigated and punished if that is the case. I don’t find the accusation that Biden broke the law as a personal affront to my entire world view. I simply don’t identify with politicians that personally.
