Many of the artists from the late 1960s who were still regularly doing covers make styles of music which were in some ways more influenced by the ethos of jazz than the ethos of rock. Herb Alpert and Dusty Springfield, for example, both come from a sort of easy-listening, light-entertainment background which had the values of Popular Music rather than pop, because their music was often aimed at older audiences who had grown up with the older values of Popular Music.
Not OP but no. A 45 was a single song per side small record played at 45RPM. A side and B side. I don't know if you've ever heard the phrase "B side" to refer to something of lower quality? Anyway, records used to come in a variety of styles. Old shellac records played on gramophones were played at 78 RPM, singles played at 45RPM, and multi-track albums played at 33RPM. Because the album contained multiple songs on it the record had to play at a slower speed (otherwise the album would be over too soon). Thus was coined the name Long Playing record, or LP.
