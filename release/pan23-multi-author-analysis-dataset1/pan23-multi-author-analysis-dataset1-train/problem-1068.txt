It sounds like you've tried most options available to you so far. Two other things you could try are contacting Code Enforcement assuming the activity is violating a noise ordinance (either for the clown playing amplified music or loud sounds late at night). And try to organize the folks in your apartment building and neighboring buildings to all sign a petition or contact the council member for your district. Along those lines, most City Council meetings afford time for residents to speak on any issue they want. Having several members of your neighborhood raise this issue over several council meetings would hopefully raise more attention. While it sounds like you've already been contacting several council members, if you have a group of concerned residents supporting you, it could cause council members to pay more attention. Last suggestion is to see if the Business Association has any public meetings you can attend and raise the issue there. Good luck!
I have actually emailed with multiple city council members over concerns with crowds gathering during the stay home orders, they replied back saying they were 'in touch' with the downtown business association, whose response was to put a few strips of caution tape and 'closed' signs on the benches, which were completely ignored by the general public. Any follow up emails regarding the situation have been ignored and not responded to since.
