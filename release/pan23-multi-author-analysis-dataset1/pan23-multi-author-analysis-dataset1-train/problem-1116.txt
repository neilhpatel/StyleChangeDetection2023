This is particularly problematic with autism because, unlike Major Depressive Disorder, the symptoms are not particularly apparent. Most autistic people require very little, if any, support to function within wider society. The main result of ASD is social awkwardness and misunderstanding, due to the fact that the brains of people with ASD do not process social cues the same way as the wider population. But people without ASD also make the occasional social faux pas, making it hard to judge where the line between ASD and a normal level of awkwardness lies. Augustus had people around him to help manage his behaviour and image, but does that reflect a regular struggle to understand social interaction and diplomatic sensitivity which would be indicative of ASD (HBO's Rome goes with this interpretation, especially in series 2), or just a recognition that having a spin doctor around is politically very useful? More severe symptoms of ASD, such as severe difficulty in having conversations to the point of appearing mute, do show up in some ancient sources, but there is absolutely no way to tell whether someone from antiquity had severe ASD or was just mute.
Ah right. Not quite sure how I feel about being a 'level', a bit weird but we move with the times. Then again I'm not quite sure about using Dr Hans Asperger's name to describe anymore since that paper a couple years back that proved how he collaborated quite a bit with the Nazis with their race hygeine bullshit. All these bloody labels eh? Anyway, thanks a lot for the replies, It's been quite educational.
Assessing mental conditions prior to the development of psychology is notoriously difficult. The most asked question on this subreddit is whether ancient/medieval soldiers experienced PTSD. The answer is... , because we can't just dig them up and subject them to a modern psychological examination.
