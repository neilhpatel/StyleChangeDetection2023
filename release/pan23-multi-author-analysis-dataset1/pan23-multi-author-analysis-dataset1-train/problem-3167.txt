This, giving the Persians about 30 times the numbers of the Greeks, is still an overwhelming force, unstoppable by a mere 7,000 except in ideal circumstances. The narrowness of the pass appears to have restricted the Persians to attacking in waves of about 10,000, so the numbers that could be committed to the battle at any one time by either side were the same. The Greeks were helped by being better armed, and by a defensive wall. How long they could have held it against repeated Persian attacks is something we don't know, since the Persians bypassed the position and threatened their rear, resulting in the retreat of much of the Greek force. Herodotus mentions 4,000 Greek casualties, which if correct means that the Greeks took severe casualties even before the last stand, and might not have been able to hold the Persians for much longer even if they weren't bypassed.
N.G.L. Hammond was 89 years old when the article you cite was published (he was an SOE operative during WW2, using his Classicist credentials as plausible cover to work in Greece). Charles Hignett (whom you cite in the other post) was of the generation before Hammond. Their views do not represent the state of the art, for which see the bibliography in the post I linked.
