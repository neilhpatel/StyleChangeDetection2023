This isn't your fault, Wikipedia has a lot of incorrect information when it comes to Frisian history. I fear one or several of their contributors had a stash of late 19th century works on the shelf and decided to add those (well intended, but by modern standards often thoroughly inadequate) books to the project. Frankly, it's a mess and sadly isn't an exception.
Eventually, in 1417, the Frisians acquired from Sigismund, the king of the Romans, an authentic charter, which granted them imperial liberty, that is, freedom from princely rule on the basis of a privilege or privileges granted by the Holy Roman Empire. (A privilege bestowed on them by William of Holland, as king of the Romans, in 1248 had been formulated in such vague terms as to have no real significance). However, one of the stipulations of Sigismundâ€™s charter was the re-introduction of an annual tribute, something the Frisians were unwilling to accept and which they ignored. When the western territories of Friesland once again recognised the count of Holland as their lord in 1421, if only for a short time, all Frisians were viewed by the Empire as rebels.
