"Closet" in this sense simply meant a private room (from the Old French "clos", where we also get "closed" in English), of which a palace would have several. Whitehall and Greenwich palaces both had several "closets" for both the King and Queen, including writing closets, robing closets, and general closets.
There were also specialist closets, such as writing closets, for specific functions - which would be restricted to different groups.
Architectural curator here. Closet was a term used for a small-ish room in a set of apartments in any large dwelling from the late medieval era through the early 19th century. This was particularly true of European estates. The closet was frequently a private room off a bedroom suite. Abigail Adams, wife of future president John Adams, was particularly taken with a closet in one of the houses they rented while John was serving in France. With a window and little desk, she thought it was a nice quiet space in which to write letters. The modern closet evolved from that concept in working class and middle class houses, but the Industrial Revolution and the resulting changes in social and domestic arrangements destined the modern closet space for storage of the many consumer goods now available to the masses in the 19th century.
