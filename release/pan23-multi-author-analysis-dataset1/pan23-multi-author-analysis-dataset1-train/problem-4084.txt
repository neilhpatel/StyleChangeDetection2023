In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Absolutely. Most of the Manchin hate I see here is entirely unwarranted. WV is redder than shit and runs on fossil fuels top to bottom. It SHOULD be an R seat and Manchin is the only reason it isn't. He's representing his constituents. Sorry they're not left leaning enough for Reddit.
Exactly. She just made herself irrelevant. Dems are super pissed off at her. No abortion healthcare protection, no student loan reform, no immigration reform…. I could go on, but she’s the reason why we can’t have nice things.

Obviously Arizona is completely different. It's purple trending light blue, with a democratic gov and 2 dem senators. There's absolutely zero reason our senator there should be about as conservative as Manchin. Sinena is the worst democratic senator by far.
