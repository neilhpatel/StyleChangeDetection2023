Iran's main defense against potential attacks on their nuclear projects has been to harden their facilities by burying them deeper and probably to concentrate their available SAMs. Engaging F-35's by moving Su-35's to intercept would be risking their most expensive and latest acquired fighter. Especially when even Russia fully delivers what they're promising to Iran that's now a small number of fighters and Russia already is trying to funnel as much of their resources as they can to their current war effort. Their current exports to the likes of Iran or India are continuing because they calculate that delaying already agreed to exports as too damaging to their long term relations and future exports, or in the case of Iran they are rewarding Iran for moving a lot of useful drone equipment to Russia that Russia needs. But Russia is free to negotiate new orders that come with war time delays baked into the export agreement and an additional Su-35 order could take a long time to fulfill.
I did! Russia has been trying really hard to make their hardware marketable. They wish they raked in what nato countries did. Russia has a hard time finding friends to sell to.
Sure, but I wouldn't doubt for a second that sales are down and marketability is significantly impacted after countries get into the nitty gritty details of these platforms' performance against similar generation or modern NATO equipment.
Holy fuck. You claimed the T-62 was on the field on the basis that it's an "old tank" citing that it was first upgraded in 1980s. You list a bunch of countries that you feel like have newer tanks. Germany's Leopard 2 was first produced in 1979.
