In addition, as soon as you tell government officials that you think it was a seizure, they are going to require you to get testing. Legally your driving will be restricted, and they may even literally suspend your license until you can prove that you are safe to drive. Even if you don't tell anyone and don't get any sort of formal restrictions put on you, you should go on your own for testing and do not drive in the meantime, because (A) you could hurt yourself or someone else and (B) since you know this is a potential issue that makes your driving unsafe, if it happens again and you hurt someone you could be civilly or even criminally liable.
