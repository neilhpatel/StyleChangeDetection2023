Seeming you mentioned the looted and presumably refurbished armour, would such armour have suffered in terms of protection? Assuming the armour was rent, buckled or otherwise damaged, could it be repaired to a similar standard as new armour in that period, or would it always be somewhat defective and lesser armour?
As I said, it's all for a DnD game and there's obviously leeway with "rule of cool", but at this point I'm really curious - I'd have assumed that damaged armour was melted down and forged again, because I can't imagine someone having the ability to repair said armour without weakening the steel/iron if it was rent.
This is a tricky question. Among reenactors and other enthusiasts there is a kind of modern folk wisdom that 'real' armour requires true tailor fitting and extensive customization - the 'bespoke' approach of extensive measurement, custom patterning and multiple fittings. And we can document this kind of close personalized for some plate armour in the late Middle Ages and Early Modern period - that of the upper reaches of the Military aristocracy - royalty and titled nobility. We have records of men at arms (knights and those who fought as knights) getting fitted for armour (as John Paston did with Martin Rondele, armourer to the Bastard of Burgundy) and other cases of kings or nobles sending their doublets and other closely fitted pieces of clothing to their armourers for reference if they could not be fit in person. In the case of Kings, they would often have court favorite armourers who might have measurements stored, or who might even travel with them to measure and fit, as Kolman Helmschsmidt travelled with Charles V.
