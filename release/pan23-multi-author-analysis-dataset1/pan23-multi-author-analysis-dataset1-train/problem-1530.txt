Just curious - what would be the difference between us quietly playing, and us just being there? They’re in fairly populated areas where people typically just walk anyway. It’s a more populated area in town. Thanks for the reply!
Thanks for the reply - currently no. Most of the business places I have in mind are almost ‘strip mall-like’. Sounds lame, but there’s a few hidden gems. Wouldn’t even know how to go about that. Those would most definitely just be us, no fans, etc. (adding on after the fact) one of the places I have in mind is between two businesses, and has a really amazing echo-chamber like tunnel/ hallway/ alley, etc. it’s outdoors, obviously, but has a roof over it.
Doing this without permission could get you ticketed for various municipal ordinance violations and/or arrested for trespassing.
That’s kind of what we figured. We definitely would pick up any trash before we left. We probably wouldn’t even bring anything considered ‘trash’ anyway. Maybe a water bottle or two, but probably not even that, ha.
