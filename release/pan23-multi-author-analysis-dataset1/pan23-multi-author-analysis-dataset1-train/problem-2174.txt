The Spartan reality is more complex. There were Spartan poets, like Tyrtaios and Alkman. We now know that Spartan elite was literate, thanks to work by scholars like Paul Cartledge. And recent work by Stephen Hodkinson has overturned our old ideas about Spartan militarism: Hodkinson's archaeological evidence shows that Spartans were foremost farmers, that their famous 'military training machine' was far less pervasive than we once believed, and that the Spartan city state had more similarities with other Greek cities than differences.
It's not a formal category. I'm using the term here to mean those people whose Greekness was contested (like Macedonians) or who could be described as retaining some cultural features or customs that were considered beneath the standards of "civilised" Greeks. In the case of Aitolians this was mostly related to the fact that their communities weren't very urbanised (or even organised in poleis), that they didn't fight in hoplite formations, and that they carried weapons in civic spaces. All these things were considered barbaric or un-Greek even among peoples who were otherwise recognised as Greeks.
