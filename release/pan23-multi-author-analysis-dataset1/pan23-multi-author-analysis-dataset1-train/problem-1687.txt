It is quite true that Moltke and Prussian innovations made the ACW experience less relevant. Nor did Europe in general lack for combat experience. But the architects of German military excellence weren't complacent scoffing caricatures, either.
I think that second link is a bit unfair in a few ways. While I agree that ACW armies had a lower standard of training and professionalism, both among officers and enlisted, both armies learned a lot in four years of fighting. Armies moved away from massed infantry formations (battle lines loosened up considerably late in the war), did employ light infantry (though perhaps not to the extent of some European powers), and generally adapted to the weapons of the time. For one thing, while rifles were superior to smoothbores, without training in estimating ranges and adjusting sights—something which wasn’t really done on a large scale—they don’t have a hugely better effective range.
. I bring up that the Americans were disadvantaged from the start, raising completely new troops without the military establishment to do it, and that the Moltke quote is probably false.
