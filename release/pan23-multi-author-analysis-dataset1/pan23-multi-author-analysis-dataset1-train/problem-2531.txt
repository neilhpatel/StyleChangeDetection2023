Do Egyptologists know more about Old Kingdom Egypt than the common Egyptian on the street in Cleopatra's time? Possibly. Only a very small percentage of people in ancient Egypt were literate, and most did not have access to temple libraries. Royalty and court scholars were literate, however, and they were familiar with the history of Egypt. Prior to the decipherment of hieroglyphs, Egyptian history was known primarily from historians in the Greco-Roman period like Manetho (3rd century BCE), to whom we owe the numbered system of dynasties that is - for better or worse - still used today.
>In terms of a normative "shape" to histories of Egypt, scholars long ago chose a Manethonian skeleton and proceeded to fill it with simple, parroted event history. But this shape is by no means sacrosanct, or even meaningful, and cries out to be abandoned. We are certainly not obliged to retain it...
That's interesting. So about when did the Egyptians start forgetting their early history? Was it after they started abandoning their old religion and hieroglyphs and started adopting Christianity and the Coptic alphabet? I would assume by the time of the Islamic era, no Egyptian could read any of the ancient writing if they were even still available.
