Right. In retrospect we should have used the hazard lights. I’m just concerned because of injuries and the damages to the other vehicle that that side has a huge cost associated with it and even if we carry 20% of fault it’s going to be expensive and make the insurance go through the roof.
Yeah I’m not worried about paying out of pocket just that if there is an expensive claim on their side ( let’s say the vehicle was worth 10,000 and then medical bills and lost wages) so my damages are around $1500 for my bumper. Obviously theirs are a lot higher and if I’m assigned let’s say 20% fault and they have a $50000 claim that means my insurance pays them 20% of that, right? I just wasn’t sure if it changed fault given that I was parked around a curve. Other driver said when she came around the corner my brights blinded her and then once she realized I was in her lane it was too late to stop. The trooper that responded reamed our asses pretty good for being stopped there. The item we were retrieving was a moose that someone had hit coming around that same corner. I’m just hoping they are 100% at fault because I don’t want my rates to go up they are high already because we had an accident before.
Insurance operates differently. Unless Alaska is like, but unlike, all the other states with virtually identical laws. Ultimately, you'll be made whole. They'll be made whole. Nothing else really matter, you won't be paying OOP for them. Unless I'm missing something super obvious?
