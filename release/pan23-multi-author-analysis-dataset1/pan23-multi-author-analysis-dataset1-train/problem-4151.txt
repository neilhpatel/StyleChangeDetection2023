All other countries, not just NATO will have motivation to see the Russian federation fall not because what they're doing in Ukraine is an obvious war crime, but rather it makes global annihilation a real and honest possibility.
Didn't mean to offend. I suppose I already have access to weapons of war in my country. It just seems after a year of this I'm surprised I haven't seen anything more violent from protests in Russia. I can't know what it's like there though.
Every single opposition leader since 2007 was screaming out that putin is a murderous dictator but nobody gave a shit, enabling him all these years, sending your international observers to russian elections and reporting that everything is absolutely fine, while we didn't have a proper election since 1996. Now that the dictatorship has spilled over into war and every opposition leader is either dead, imprisoned or exiled out of the country, suddenly all russians are displayed as approving of war in a country with no sociology and it is only our fault.
This. It’s all fun and games until a Nuke happens. Once that cherry’s popped (again) all bets are off. We’ll have to start taking it all much more seriously.
