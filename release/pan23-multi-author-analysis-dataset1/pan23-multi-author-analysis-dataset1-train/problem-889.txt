Gotcha. The photo they provided from Google is not accurate. You would need a survey done in order to properly determine the property line. Google tries it's best, but what they're showing isn't 100% accurate.
If all the properties in question are over 21 years old (the statutory period for adverse possession in PA) and have fenced or otherwise well-defined yards, adverse possession may have rectified the problematic boundaries, that's really what the concept of adverse possession is all about-- to provide a means of making the legal boundaries of a property match the functional boundaries, while giving landowners plenty of time to assert their rights and reclaim their land from improperly placed fences, roads cutting across their property, and malicious land grabs.
What location? Property lines ‘don’t shift over time,’ other than by some legal or equitable means (eg adverse possession, bought land or easement). If it is something other than buying out the neighbor, those rights might not even be able to pass to you (depends on location). I would get that sorted out. If you really, really want the house and are willing to take the chance of being kicked out, you can insure the crap out of the transaction with your title insurance company, but that might not cover everything, so read the policy carefully.
This. Most county GIS websites have a disclaimer you have to click through saying they aren’t official for precisely this reason. Get a survey done; that will tell your if there’s actually an issue, or if this is just an error in some GIS records.
