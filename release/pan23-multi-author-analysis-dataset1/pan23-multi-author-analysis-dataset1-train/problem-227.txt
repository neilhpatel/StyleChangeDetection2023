Yeah still doesn’t make sense, you really think a world with 2 billion people polluted more than a world with 8 billion? Is this just something you want to believe?
Nuclear. We have the technology, it’s safer than Chernobyl days, and relatively clean. The only real issue is where to store the waste.
It's an accident that has cost over $100 billion dollars, nearly caused the complete collapse of nuclear power sector in Japan (which previously had 30% of its power from nuclear) and did seal the death of nuclear power in Germany, led to 154,000 people being evacuated temporarily and 28,000 of them still not returning home 11 years later, 322 square kilometres remain under evacuation orders. Yes it was a horrible accident.
I just have a hunch that thinking about what would replace nuclear before banning it would've been a good idea, also banning it out of fearmongering after Fukushima doesn't sound all that wise since, you know, Germany gets one earthquake every blue moon, but I'm not German nor do I live in Germany, and from my point of view, the more they suffer, the better, hopefully they learn something this time around.
And man is very stupid. For example, not considering that an earthquake and tsunami may happen at the time and what the consequences are if the sea walls are overtopped. Humans make loads of mistakes.
