Anything else (other bank accounts, personal property, cars, jewelry, stocks, whatever else that is not joint and doesn't have a named beneficiary) forms his estate. Since he did not leave a will, the law provides how it will be distributed. If the value of all this is less than $50,000 your mom can file a form called an affidavit stating that and there will be no further court involvement. If there is more than $50,000 there is some more paperwork required but it should not be very stressful--it is called summary probate and likely will not involve any in-person hearings. If all his children are born of your mother, then she will receive 100% of the estate, simple as that. (If she does not write a will herself, then upon her passing everything would then be split equally between you and your brother, which is why the law just gives it all to her for now.).
An estate lawyer can assist with the necessary paperwork, but it should not be particularly difficult or horrifyingly expensive. It's theoretically DIY-able, but frankly your Mom has other things to worry about right now.
