Everyone in this thread is focused on Finland, but the order also increases the military to 1.5M active duty. They currently have 1M, so this is increasing their active duty by 50%. There's little reason to think Russia can afford to do this or that the troops will be adequately trained/supplied. I think this is much less likely than a few bases on the Finish border.
They kept retreating to further defensive lines on the mannerheim line multiple times when Mannerheim forced troops to stop retreating to more defensible positions because they NEEDED to have the appearance of a solid defense to bolster their negotiations of the Finnish government with the soviet union to get a peace agreement. They had to make it look like Finland still had a huge fight in them, and to make it seem like it wasn't worth it to Stalin to try and invade the entire country. But if the Soviet union knew how close to collapse they were, they would've continued on and occupied Finland since the army was barely holding on anymore.
