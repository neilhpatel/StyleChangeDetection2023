If you end up not getting a response after a day or two, consider asking a new question focusing instead on why what happened did happen (rather than why what didn't happen didn't happen) - this kind of question is more likely to get a response in our experience. Hope this helps!
And speaking of geographical disadvantages: Rome, arguably the most "successful" ancient Mediterranean city, was in a positively terrible spot according to the arguments of environmental determinism. On a scattering of low hills in the midst of a swamp, far inland on a very temperamental river which is not easily navigable, and with no natural port options nearby. She was situated right smack in the middle of dozens of early rivals who were either equal to her, or much more powerful than her, including the very potent city-state of Veii just down the road, and a constellation of powerful Etruscan cities to the north. The farmland of Latium is good, but not as good as the volcanically-enriched soils of Campania to the south. The Capitoline Hill is reasonable as a defensible citadel, but it is nothing like the great fortresses of the Apennines, like Corfinium. All in all, a middling to poor grade as far as geographical profile for "city-state success.".
I know Hohokam settled portions of the Colorado River Valley (really the Salt River Valley, a tributary that runs into the Colorado River) with similar conditions to the Nile River Valley, but their agricultural civilization apparently disappeared due to a megadrought rapidly changing climate conditions. Has evidence been found that showed the civilization moving towards large, centralized governance and megaprojects (such as huge temples and burial sites) like the Mayan or Egyptian civilizations?
