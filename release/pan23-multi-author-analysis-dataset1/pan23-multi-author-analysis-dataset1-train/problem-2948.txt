A good break from "The Dark Ages" is Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Albeit set in 1403, after the sort of 'peak' medieval that people tend to think about, it is based around a lot of local Czech records that the company, being a local Czech group, has access to - records obscure enough to have little internet presence. It offers an interesting contrast to all of it - the start of the game features atrocities committed in the same flowery fields and bright sunshine that you were drinking in only a few minutes prior, religion is present even in common day-to-day speech with greetings such as "Jesus Christ be praised" which have become somewhat memetic in the community, and being a goodly Christian is what the game encourages while the main villains are the "heathen" Cumans (albeit, I believe at this point they were Christianized). There's some playing around with Jan Hus and Waldensians but ultimately it's not really in your role as a soldier and blacksmith to deal with that sort of stuff. You meet one preacher who is only in his job because he was a noble's youngest son and doesn't really care for it who supports the Hussites to a limited degree, and you meet a lord who thinks the mention of Waldensians is just a ploy by the Church to snag his estates because "Have you ever seen a heretic?".
I think really, while this is not something that you'd never find in the Middle Ages (well, except maybe the racism , which is quite anachronistic), it's really much more about how modern people view medieval religion through their own modern issues, than looking at the kind of religious issues that did cause tension between central authorities and peripheral groups. Games don't really present equivalents to the tensions/syncretism between paganism and Christianity, or the Hussites, or something like that. This isn't just games of course, but also films, tv shows, and books.
