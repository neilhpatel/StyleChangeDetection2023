How 4 general commanders are anti-israel and the ONLY person who it makes sense to control the military+ police is a guy who was refused service on account of being mentally unstable.
Most of us did. The breakdown of parties and the necessity to form a coalition is what kept him in power. 51% voted for parties opposed to him, but that side is more fractured (includes Left, Right, Communist, and Arab parties) than the pro-Bibi camp (Haredi parties, Likud, and the abomination that is the 'Religious Zionism' party).
Nothing happened yet. When the law passes and there are no riots on the streets I would agree with you that we fucked up.
You do realise the majority of Israel are secular - I agree with you completely re religious but jobs of any religion but this conversation is about Israel as a whole not the religious but jobs that unfortunately happen to be in power currently due to a flawed politics system (similar to the us) - as a side note the majority of Jews around the world are secular and left leaning (Jewish people as a% are far more supportive of lgbt rights and other social issues - in the USA they vote 70%+ democratic - i assume the other 30% are where the religious but jobs reside).
Though still blaming individuals is not cool. I didn't vote for Bibi, the vast majority of Israelis didn't, and even less voted for those lunatics trying to pass the law.
