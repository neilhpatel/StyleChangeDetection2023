Denim is simply a cotton twill, colored after weaving with indigo or a synthetic imitation. Cotton twill is pretty ordinary, historically, as a strong yet supple fabric: it was the fabric typically used for corsets in the nineteenth century, as well as other items, like trousers, that might be under a lot of stress and see a lot of wear - at the time, "jean" was specifically a somewhat delicate twill, while denim was definitely intended for labor. The use of indigo makes it interesting, as raw indigo requires a chemical bath (in the past, it often involved urine) in order to break it down into something that will attach to a textile, in a process much more complicated than the ones used for other vegetable-based dyes.
