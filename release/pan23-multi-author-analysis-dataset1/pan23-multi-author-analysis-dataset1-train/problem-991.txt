Most American historians of China in the post-WW2 period tended to approach modern Chinese history in terms of a fundamental paradigm shift beginning with the Opium War with Britain in 1839/40, which in effect ended 'traditional' China and sparked a continual confrontation with, depending on approach, either 'the West' (however vaguely defined), argued to be the locus of historical dynamism unlike the unchanging Orient, or the concept of 'modernity' (also however vaguely defined). The 1980s saw a transition towards the 'China-centric' model, which discarded the trope of the static Orient in favour of recognising China's own internal dynamics, and argued against the hard boundary of 1840, instead highlighting continuities despite the intrusion of Western imperialism. In turn, the 1990s saw the emergence of the 'New Qing' paradigm, which much more strongly highlighted the discontinuity represented by the Qing state specifically, and led to a re-evaluation of a number of aspects such as religion and ethnicity that previous discussions of Qing history tended to overlook.
