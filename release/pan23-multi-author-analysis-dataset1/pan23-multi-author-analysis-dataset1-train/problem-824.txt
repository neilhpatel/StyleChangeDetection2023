My own tuppence on this most interesting question. My area of expertise encompasses two of the most brutal, bloody, and terrifying conflicts in the history of our race. In the course of my research I've seen photos of combatants with all innocence gone from their eyes, the atrocities committed by both sides in the pursuit of victory, and the destruction wrought on our planet's own face. In short, I find truth in the words of Arthur Koestler:
Yet in the era there was an advancement in medicine, inventions, history, philosophy, literature, there was major economic development of the south which went from place of exile to a powerful part of China thanks to the Wu dynasty. There was suffering and that should never be neglected or waved away, but there many who strived to better things via such ideas or via bringing in agricultural colonies to end the famines, to take on the problems of their generation and they had seen in the past.
I'll throw in my two cents. I study and write on what is perhaps (one of?) the worst movements to ever arise in human history. For the answers I write here, I have to dig through aggregate data involving the loss of millions of people and on essentially every page of National Socialist history there is at least one war crime.
