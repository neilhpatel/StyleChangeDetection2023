While there was a piece of unimproved real estate, it had practically no value due to location, so I called the county where the taxes were past due to let them know the owner was dead and no one would be paying them (to let the collector know to plan to tax sale it.). Then I called the neighbor to let them know, so they would secure it, and they would go to the tax sale. It was up to them to then do the quiet title action to combine it with theirs.
Unfortunately, I once heard that if you pay anything towards any bill that you are not actually responsible for, (credit cards that didnt have your name on them, you didnt use, and were not used to buy things that you were using or benefiting from, or hospital bills that occurred before you were married or were accrued by a parent) then you could legally be seen as assuming responsibility and are therefore responsible for ALL debt of the deceased party.
No. You actually werenâ€™t required to use the life insurance money to pay down the credit card debt either. That was your money, which passed outside of probate.
