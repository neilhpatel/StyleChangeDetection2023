Only you can say if you want to walk into work every day worrying about the folks next door taking up a grudge. I've literally outlived the guys I couldn't stand, so I'm not a great reference.
Thing is what if they showed up when I was at work (restraining order wise)I mean that employer also knows where I work so they could essentially have served me there.Yes I have not received a notice regarding a hearing.The manager of that store where the incident occurred told me to call my cook county circuit to find out if there is one but I don't want to set myself up and have one filed against me just by asking.I have not received a restraining order and do not know IF I will receive o e if I do transfer there.Given the fact that I should have received one by now but didnt what if I didn't receive a restraining order and I still transferred? The fact that they've been told not to be in contact with me or talk to me kinda makes me feel better as to them not harassing me and I feel like if they did it would hold them liable to harassment or assault if they do plan to take it that far.
