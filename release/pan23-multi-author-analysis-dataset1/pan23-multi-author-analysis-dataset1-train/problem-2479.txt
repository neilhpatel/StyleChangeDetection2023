The Supreme Court just extended title 42 “temporarily”, but they’ve also let a federal Texas judge actually manage the border patrol in another bizarro move of having the judicial system oversee the executive.
GOP plan. Stall any immigration reform in the House until 2025. Fox boosts narrative of “open borders”. New or old strongman emerges as GOP candidate. Punishing recession drives more resentment and fear about the “illegals” coming for YOUR jobs. 75 thousand sway-able voters pull the lever for Team RED in Nov 2024. EC swings to GOP. Trump/DeSantis/Lucifer claims mandate.
Things were a lot different back then. There really was no formal immigration system. There were no asylum hearings or visas or green cards. Unless you were noticeably I’ll with some infectious disease they let you in. The country needed workers back then. Ironically we do now too.
It is related though. If you shut down or greatly restrict the asylum process indefinitely or permanently how do you think migrants will respond? They’ll just try crossing the border illegally.
