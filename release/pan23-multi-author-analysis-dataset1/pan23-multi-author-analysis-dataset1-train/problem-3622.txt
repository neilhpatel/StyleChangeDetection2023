I think maybe I wasn't clear. It appears that you gave them dates/times that you are available to work, and they want to see your class schedule to confirm when you are in class and when you are free. You are worried that giving them a truthful version of your schedule, they will give you shifts you either (a) do not want to work, or (b) can not work.
In short, I know you're worried that they'll give you shifts you said "don't work" for you, but I do not know why they don't work. I am asking for the why you gave them different availability than your schedule would reflect. I am not assuming it's a sinister reason; it's just necessary to understand what's going on here since it really isn't clear, and I think it might be giving people the wrong impression as to why you're asking for help, and explain your prior tech post to make a forged copy for your employer to hide actual ability.
She can already do that. She is not bound to work around your schedule. Giving her the schedule literally helps you. And you can give it and she can literally, legally, schedule you for exactly when you have classes.
