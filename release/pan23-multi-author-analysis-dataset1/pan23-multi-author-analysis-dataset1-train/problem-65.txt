Just looking at images, it's fascinating that the building is being quite deliberately kept in partial disrepair, and that that's an aspect that will be quite actively embraced in future. This question may be a bit over-broad, but what led to this state, why had it not been restored at some earlier point, and I suppose most importantly, what was the thinking behind embracing and preserving the building's current state, and what do you want visitors to take away from doing so?
Thank you for doing this AMA! I'm curious how you've built up an understanding of the history of the house and land - is there an archive of documents associated with the house that you can draw your research from, or do you mostly rely on non-specific academic works and off-site archives, or a mix of both? Have many archaeological digs been undertaken?
