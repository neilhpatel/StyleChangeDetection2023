This gets into rather thorny ground, which has been debated for a very long time since the 1950s. You are basically asking, "what, exactly, was the genesis of the Teller-Ulam idea?" Teller argued that it was directly a result of the increased priority, etc., given to the work, and thus in his mind the H-bomb "crash program" saw real results. But Bethe and others (including Oppenheimer) argued that it was not the result of any new attention, but rather a result of some new calculational tools (which would have been available anyway) that finally saw the Classical Super put into the dustbin by the spring of 1950, and ideas from Teller and Ulam that were essentially "out of context," in that they were not affected by the priority shift. This lead to the rather strange situation in which Teller was arguing that the Teller-Ulam idea was nothing special, just what happens when you apply more time and urgency to old questions they already had, and where Teller's opponents were instead arguing that Teller had been a genius, and thus it had nothing to do with funding, etc.
Thanks too for linking your blog post! The timelines you drew really helped illustrate the different scenarios.
