However, I want to be very clear with you that there is a real chance that you'd be throwing good money after bad: your family member can only pay you with money they have or income they earn, and if they're chronically broke, unemployed, or prepared to declare bankruptcy, then a judgment in your favour isn't worth much. There may also be issues with timing: many jurisdictions have a limitations period of two or three years, so you may be coming up to, or even past, the point where you can file a lawsuit over this, depending on when the last payment was and when, if ever, they ever re-acknowledged the debt in some way since then.
Thank you for this info. It’s so crazy to think of suing this persons company. They’re valued at close to $20mill so I’m hoping they do the right thing without legal intervention. But they’re not the most upstanding in terms of who they screw over to make a buck so I want to be legally prepared. This is really helpful and puts a fire under me for timing.
