Yes, not to do so would be the worst possible conduct to engage in, as the very underpinnings of the duel were about demonstrating ones manhood through the courage of putting your life on the line. For the most part, the ground rules of the duel were intended to prevent this from happening to too great a degree, with firing usually regulated to occur within a right window, meaning even if one duelist fired first, the other would have, at most, 1 or 2 seconds in which to shoot or else lose their fire, but this wasn't always the case.

One of the ways that you defended your honor was by being able to stand there unflinchingly while your opponent took aim and fired.
