Yeah the officer at the scene said to sue, but I think he was just being excitable/angry that the driver was clearly not paying attention. I agree this doesn't sound like a suit kind of claim after all, I was just wondering if there was any merit to what he said. I will disagree that there are plenty of occasions where the airbags wouldn't go off at 50 mph, as that's what they're designed for. But at this stage, feels like not much we can do besides rest and make a hundred phone calls, thanks for your time.
Not entirely sure what you plan on suing for unless you can somehow prove that the airbags not deploying somehow injured you, and that they were supposed to deploy, and that the alleged recall was in effect when you bought the car (for your particular car, not just same make and model of same year), and that the recall specifically addressed airbags erroneously not deploying, and that the selling dealership was aware of it and willfully or negligently sold you a death trap.
This makes sense, thanks for your response. The cop kept talking about suing the dealer which I didn't understand, so wanted to check here if that was actually a thing.
