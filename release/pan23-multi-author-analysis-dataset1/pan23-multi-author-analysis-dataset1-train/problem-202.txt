Thank you for the fabulous Pride and Prejudice explanation to bring in specifics! I wrote my thesis on Jane Austen and was fascinated to learn, for example, about the number of servants the Bennets would have had who are never mentioned in the book—the maids, the cooks, the gardeners, the grooms, and so on. The cash-poor aristocracy is so interesting; when, in Sense and Sensibility, the Dashwoods move to a tiny (four bedroom, two parlour, two staircase) cottage, no one ever suggests that Elinor should get a job or become a governess. Gentile poverty was still preferable to industrious working class. Sense and Sensibility is also a great example of what happens when the land settlement does not clearly state what happens to the widow and daughters—their brother was able to force them out with almost nothing a year.
Not really. The gentry widely intermarried with the baronetage and the peerage. A duke would not have considered an untitled person from an ancient family to be "less than" in terms of class, but only in rank. They would have all been considered equal as gentlemen, which is why having land and passive income was so important in order to draw a distinction in between new money and the old families.
Good to know! It’s fun to realize that a solid chunk of legal practice hasn’t really changed all that much in the intervening 300+ years, hah. This is also definitely the most real-world use I’ll ever get out of knowing (about) RAP.
