Well she is responsible for him being released. Without her in exchange he'd still be in prison. IDK maybe she pleaded with them not to make one of the worst prisoner exchanges in history. Maybe she said my freedom is not worth risking the lives of countless men, women and children. Nor is it worth freeing a mass murderer. I don't know that she didn't say that. If someone accidentally burns down an orphanage and gets a bunch of kids killed is that ok? Should they not suffer some consequences?
Russia is not having trouble supplying their troops with old Soviet junk, they're having a hard time supplying their troops with thermal optics, composite body armor, night vision goggles, precision guided munitions, and modern well maintained armored vehicles. Viktor Bout is going to be of absolutely no use to Russia with respect to their current war effort.
Ummmmmmmmm China. Home of 1.4 billion people. Not sure what that has to do with an idiot being arrested in Russia and released likely at the cost of the lives of countless innocent people though.
