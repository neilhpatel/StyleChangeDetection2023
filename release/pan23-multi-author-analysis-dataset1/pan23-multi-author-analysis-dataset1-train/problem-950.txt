Now they are pretending to be against Trump and election denial because it's wrong for the country and party. Lol.
I remember how not so long ago, in 2020 the then Election in charge in Georgia, Donald Sterling (a Republican) regularly sent out tweets and held press briefing to clearly explain the process, update what was happening and dispel notions of many election lies spread by who else Trump & his minions. It was thanks to him and many such hard working public officials, the every day Americans doing their job with honesty & integrity (setting aside their personal politics) that we still have a functioning democracy in this country.
They did seem prepared. Gates was also protective of the volunteers when he spoke out, too. The insinuations were insulting to those people and he basically went out and said, ‘shame on you’ to the people trying to sow discourse while volunteers were working their asses off.
