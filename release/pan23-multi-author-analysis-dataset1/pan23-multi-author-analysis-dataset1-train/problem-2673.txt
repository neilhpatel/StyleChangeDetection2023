There will be no deal. The Russians will be forced out of Ukraine, Ukraine will join NATO (or at least get defense pacts with NATO countries) and if the Russians ever try to invade again, their forces will be obliterated by Ukraine and it's allies in a heartbeat. That's the deal.
I'm sure that the Kremlin's plans have been foiled a fair bit by Western support for Ukraine, but if the military-political leadership of Russia thought that this fight's outcome is as predetermined as you seem to think it is, they'd have worked out some kind of behind-the-scenes graceful exit from the war long ago.
Surrender. Pull your army and equipment COMPLETELY out of Ukraine, even the parts you claim are Russia. Immediately start paying Ukraine 1 trillion dollars in reparations. Then report to Siberia where you will be given Navalny's old cell while you await trial for your many many war crimes.
Attempted assassination of leadership is very much interfering. (it's pretty much an act of war, and frankly, was the cause of WWI, which also didn't work out very well for Russia).
