When I think abt Kevin McCarthy on Election Night with the huge celebration planned and...nobody was celebrating. On the scene reporter, Garret Haake, reported like 3-4x as it got later into the night, "Um, I'm at the HQ of Kevin McCarthy's celebration, but it appears no one is really celebrating". Then McCarthy was like "Laters We'll be winners in the morning" It's Saturday. And considering how dems overperformed and beat polling all across the country, why wouldn't I believe, that in red Orange County that's getting bluer in prior elections...why couldn't something similar happen there? Karen Bass, a progressive, has overtaken her moderate Dem opponent. There's something special happening. Maybe Dems have a chance of making it more even, or, gasp, keeping the House? (I realize it's slim. But apparently abortion plaed big in orange county).

Oh, absolutely. I agree. And if the repubs in Congress, or anywhere else for that matter, think trump is just going to fade away, theyâ€™re just as delusional as his base.
