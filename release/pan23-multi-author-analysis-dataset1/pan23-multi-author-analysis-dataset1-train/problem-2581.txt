In the Classical world (as might be expected), the circumstances, motivations, and methods of language learning varied considerably. The most famous group of language learners are of course the Roman elite, who were expected for centuries to have at least a reading knowledge of Greek. On a humbler social level, the tens of thousands of Roman merchants and colonists who settled in the Greek world had to learn enough of the language to go about their daily business. Many of the hundreds of thousands of slaves imported into Italy from the Greek world following the wars of the middle and late Republic, likewise, were expected to master at least rudimentary Latin. On a still grander scale, recruits in the Roman army had to absorb enough Latin to follow commands and communicate with their fellow soldiers.
Soldiers in the Roman army certainly learned basic Latin - but keep in mind that the legions never had more than c. 400,000 men (in an Empire of about 60,000,000). These men (if they happened to have a native language other than Latin) would become bilingual. But the majority who never left their farm or village would have very limited dealings with the imperial government, and little direct motivation to learn Latin. Although Latin did eventually become the dominant language of the western provinces, it was a very slow process, only completed in late antiquity.
Thanks. Sorry for another question. What about administrative duties. I know the romans started with a more hands off approach till the late republican era when it became more hands on. How would the different languages affect this and would administrators(atleast those during the transition from the hands off rule and the more hands on rule) be multilingual?
