I agree completely that many questions presented here have embedded assumptions and that often these assumptions are troubling, prejudicial, or at least presentist in some way. I often begin answers by challenging the premise of the question, and that is often a necessary place to begin. You are right!
Thirdly, why Islamic countries have not fallen into the pattern of secularization which has characterized nominally confessional Jewish and Christian communities throughout the Western Hemisphere is a worthwhile question. As to whether we can substantiate the religiosity of peoples in different parts of the world, and compare it to others, we can with polling data. While Iâ€™m not knowledgeable enough to verify the quoted comparison of Chileans vs Tunisians (according to my linked source, Tunisians are more religious than Chileans, incidentally), I can with a Google search verify that lots of collected data would support the conclusion that people in the Middle East for example, are more religious than people in Europe.
2. The only Western country to still use capital punishment is the US, while it is still used in most MENA countries, as well as in Indonesia and Bangladesh. No Western country uses corporal punishment in criminal law and many have criminalised it in all settings, while several Muslim countries still do. Latin America is not big on either.
Humans are inherently prejudiced. This prejudice obviously then reflects in the questions they pose. It is better to accept this prejudice as an inherent part of human nature.
