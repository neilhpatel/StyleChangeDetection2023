Is it possible for someone to answer a follow-up question to this answer? If it needs to be a new thread that's fine, just want to put out the question: the end of the answer said "the end of the war is when the dam broke for abolition." What did that look like? Was it just a matter of "free states outnumbered the loyal slave states so free states forced through the Reconstruction Amendments while the rebellious states were still not readmitted to the union"? What was that political battle like?
In response to the Southern reaction, the federal government added the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution and revised their reconstruction plans to further emphasize and protect the civil rights, especially voting rights, of all citizens, including black or formerly enslaved people. Radical Reconstruction, as it is popularly known today, was led by the Republicans in Congress and passed the Reconstruction Acts, which implemented military supervision and guidance of the South since several states were refusing to recognize the 14th and 15th Amendments.
Yeah, I mean, basically that. But at the same time, no, it was much more complex. Let me take a deep breath...
So the political battle that ensued after "the flood gates were opened" took place in both the federal and state governments, as well as in local communities as black people and abolitionists attempted to establish post-slavery governments in the midst of violent Southern white backlash to the sudden changes.
Southern state governments passed Black Codes which limited the newfound civil rights of black people in the U.S. and disgruntled Southern white people resorted to using violence to strike fear in black people and discourage them from exercising their civil rights, eventually resulting in the formation of the Ku Klux Klan.
