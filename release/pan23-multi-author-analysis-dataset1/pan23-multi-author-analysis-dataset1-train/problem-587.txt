NAL but it seems to me that it would be a breach of psychotherapist-patient confidentiality if the therapist "called it in" it to the organization; therefore the organization could not retaliate against you legally if the only evidence they have of the breach is hearsay from a psychotherapist breaking confidentiality rules. Again, not a lawyer, but studying for the Bar exam at the moment.
Second, therapists are bound by confidentiality agreements. If you fear that the entire region is corrupted, why not use an online therapist from a different region? Most do online appointments now.
Virginia law recognizes the psychotherapist-patient privilege in civil actions. Breach of an NDA is a civil matter. So I really do think she's good to talk to a therapist.
So this is actually counterproductive. If you don't feel comfortable including your state, go back and correct your post to say that. Including an incorrect state (as opposed to no state) just increases your chances of getting wrong information.
