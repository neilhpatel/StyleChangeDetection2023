Also what about the YABLOKO Party which remains in the russian political system but is running on a "end this" program and before the war advocated for the return of Crimea and leaving the Donbass and westernizing russia?? They are pacifists and are old, but they are the ones that gave a voice to quite a few of the current protesters (navalny started as a member but got kicked out for participating in far right rallies causing him to still hate them nowadays, but many others had more peaceful memberships).
I'm not really sure what to say. It's more apt of a prediction for Russia than for Europe, I think. Sure we're paying the price for reliance on Russia for power now, but it's not like every European nation is scrambling to find other sources to cover that. Oh wait, that's exactly what a lot are doing.
Russian people who don't accept what the Russian army/Wagner are doing in Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and parts of Africa at this very moment are a huge problem, as Russia is the most populous country in Europe and has never moved past the expansionist mindset that gained it so much land in the 1940s, some of which it still has (the Southern Kurils, northern East Prussia and Finnish Karelia, and all that land it is trying to eat of Ukraine's this very year).
