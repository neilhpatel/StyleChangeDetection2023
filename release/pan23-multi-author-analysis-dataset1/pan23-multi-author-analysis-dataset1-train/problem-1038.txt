John is the most widely credited as the factor that "destroyed" the group, due to his relationship with artist Yoko Ono - he was the first to leave the group officially, whilst Ringo and George always returned. This is mostly an oversimplification, but its true Yoko was a catalyst for unhappiness - there had always been a rule of "no wives or girlfriends" at rehearsal or recording, and John frequently broke this rule by bringing Yoko along. She also overstepped boundaries, giving comments on other members writing and performances, something they found innappropriate. George can be seen complaining about Yoko on mulitple occassions on the film Let It Be. Yoko encouraged John's more experimental style, and their solo album Two Virgins was seen by the rest of the group as confusing and unnecessary. This led to John's overt dislike of Paul's songwriting, and he refused to perform on many of his songs.
Despite McCartney's equivocation - 'temporary or permanent? I don't really know' - the press certainly treated this as headline news that the Beatles breaking up.
