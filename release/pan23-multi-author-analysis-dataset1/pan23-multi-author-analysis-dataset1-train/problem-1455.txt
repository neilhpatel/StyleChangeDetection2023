Part of this is simple reasoning. Bombs can cause a lot of damage, significantly so when you drop them in large quanities, but they don't really force someone with a rifle to stop unless they hit that person. They also had other major limitations that meant a dedicated force could usually not be bombed into surrendering. Limitations like you can't really fly constant bombing runs over everything, non guided bombing (dumb bombs) aren't very accurate, a bombing run costs supplies even if nobody gets damaged, and such.
1. Your Primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.
All of this makes sense. France was, technically, an occupied state to be freed. Bombing their civilians was therefore restricted (Same for Italy once it flipped I might add!) where as Germany was never anything other then a enemy state to be beaten. Tactics would have been different, and the bombing campaigns carried out, different.
