It is also true that most of the planning and execution of military campaigning did not concern itself with the field of battle. Set-piece battles, while certainly more interesting to dramatize in literature and film, were incredibly risky affairs that prudent commanders would want to avoid (because a smaller, weaker force will never engage a larger one unless forced to, almost all battles only ever emerged when both sides felt they had a good chance of winning). Thus raiding, pillaging, laying siege, and controlling strategic locations were more often then not the primary and decisive factors in a military expedition (many military commanders were influenced by the Roman author Vegetus, who advocated for this variety of military strategy; many others adopted these strategies out of convenience).
For what it's worth, the scene in question doesn't play out like that. Like the real battle of agincourt they end up in knee-deep mud with a more brutal sort of melee. That said, I did think there was a distinct lack of banners or coats of arms on both sides. I'm sure not every breastplate of the time was decorated but I had the same thoughts as OP.
