I first heard allegations of the BBC being transphobic when . I'm pretty sure the article has been heavily edited since its publication. A left-wing youtuber has made a video series detailing their criticisms of the article as well as the BBC's responses to their complaints, and you should be able to find a lot of what's been edited out of the article in their videos. . I don't really follow LGBTQ+ issues all too closely, so I can't speak to the issue the article discusses, but based on what I've seen it does seem like the BBC cited poorly researched or explicitly biased/transphobic sources, left out information/sources with viewpoints differing from that of the article, originally had a headline blaming trans women for pressuring lesbian women into having sex, and in general casts some sort of "trans establishment" in a negative light.
This is some weird alchemy. That is not how reading works, except for new readers. Find some words you recognize and guess what the sentence means. Read and re-read what I actually wrote.
Bahahahha. My comments on this sub are about how the Republicans are politically doomed. First time I’ve even mentioned the topic in months on here. “Everything,” is a hyperbolic term.
