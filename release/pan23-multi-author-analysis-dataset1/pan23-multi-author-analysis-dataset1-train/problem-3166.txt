"Stable future" is an interesting construction. I would assume you have Iraq and Afghanistan (maybe Vietnam) in mind, wars usually perceived to have resulted in great instability. Iraq has post-invasion been called a partly-failed state. Afghanistan is more complicated, there was a decade of Soviet Intervention then six years of civil war. The Taliban never fully consolidated control, and low-level fighting continued from 1996 until the US-led invasion.
That is not what ex silentio means. It means “from silence”, meaning an argument due to silence. I.e. “the sources don’t say anything about X event so it must not have happened”. That’s an argument from silence. Or, another form would be: “X government program prevented the loss of even more jobs”. There is “silence” on this topic because you can’t know with certainty what else might have happened because those circumstances did not exist. It’s basically another way of saying that you’re trying to prove a negative. It’s a difficult task. Sure, some situations lend themselves to it, “if the police hadn’t shown up just in time, that maniac would have killed even more people!”. But in most cases, situations are more complex and trying to prove what would have happened if something had or had not been done is practically impossible.
