That’s not taking action against them. There’s usually a standard form you have to fill out to obtain records. You haven’t filled out the form, ergo they aren’t giving you the records. Start there and see if it gets resolved.
The urologists finding were documented but they were both undetailed and reason to believe he embellished findings in order to pitch me on some bullshit alternative therapy that he offers (notoriously bullshit amongst uros).
There may not be an actual record of it saved then. On ultrasound machines you have to record if you want to save it. I don’t record any of my ultrasounds done in clinic, because there just isn’t really a need since you are not having anyone else look at it. That doesn’t mean that there isn’t a record, because it could have been saved. You would just have to ask. But it should be documented in a chart that an ultrasound was done and what the urologist findings were. If they didn’t document it. Then they didn’t bill you for it. And then it becomes a different situation.
