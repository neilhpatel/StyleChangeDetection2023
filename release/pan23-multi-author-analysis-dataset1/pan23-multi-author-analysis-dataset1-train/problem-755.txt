The primary impact of the Red Army under Mao Zedong was not really related to how large of a role they played in expelling or resisting the Japanese, but rather in the role they played in both Chinese nationalism and in mobilizing resistance and resentment to the Japanese among large swaths of the Chinese population in the north.

Lucien Bianco's book, Origins of the Chinese Revolution, 1915-1949, identified political as well as social and economic reasons for the massive growth of the Chinese Communist Party during the war. Bianco was extremely critical of Mao, but even he recognized that the CCP forces fought the Japanese with far more vigor than the KMT forces did. There are a number of factors explaining why, but primarily it is because the CCP forces initially were revolutionaries, and then, as they grew to number in the millions during WWII, Chinese nationalists motivated against absolutely brutal Japanese occupiers. The KMT forces were primarily conscripts who were not treated well (and often not fed). There are many examples of KMT forces abandoning battles, but in the North the communists stayed while the KMT was almost entirely behind the line. The only resistance there was led by the communists.
