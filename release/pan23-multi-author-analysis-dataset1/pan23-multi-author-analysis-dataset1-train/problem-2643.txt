Or am I misunderstanding? Maybe historians do consider the Second Party System to be a resurrections of the previous parties under John Adams/Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson/James Madison, but they are conveniently split into the First Party System and Second Party System because there was a period under Monroe and (late in his term) under Madison of moderate government that embraced some ideas of both parties? This is what I am trying to understand.
Perhaps somewhat ironically Jackson actually spent more on internal improvements than all of his predecessors. It's no coincidence that Democrats today celebrate the Jefferson-Jackson dinner and place so much emphasis on their continuity with the original Jeffersonians. Jackson however also inspired much of the same fear in some Jacksonians that Hamilton and Adams had in Republicans in the 1790's causing a splinter group of Jacksonians (most notably John Tyler) to split off and join the National Republicans to form the whigs. But to answer your question Jackson would say that HE (and not Henry Clay) was continuing the Jeffersonian legacy and party.
