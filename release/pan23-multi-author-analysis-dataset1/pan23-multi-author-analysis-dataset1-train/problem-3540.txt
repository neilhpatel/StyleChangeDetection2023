Regardless, Gerrymandering is an absolutely un-Democratic, horribly corrosive tool to systematically subvert elections and the will of the people. Two wrongs do NOT make a right.
Id love to see more national pushes for voter protections, independent redistricting, ranked choice voting, no excuse absentee voting, postage paid absentee ballots, and since Im dreaming why don't we just get money out of politics and make all campaigns and issue ads have to be funded via campaign using only federal or state dollars.
Yeah. Like in virtually every election. The state courts rule the maps unconstitutional, but they just keep submitting more unconstitutional maps then the courts finally say it's too close to the election so we have to use them. Blatant cheating.
A huge point that everyone needs to know is that gerrymandering is a fundamental foundation of the Republican Party, it is literally called "Project RedMap", it is in their party documents, developed by the Republican State Leadership Committee, and the Republican Party spent 30 million dollars initially to start the project.
