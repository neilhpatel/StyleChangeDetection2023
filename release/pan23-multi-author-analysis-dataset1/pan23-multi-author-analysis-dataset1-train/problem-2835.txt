But this obviously isn't the case now, you cross the border from Spain to France and there's no gradual shift, it's a hard transition. What happened? Well, some of these towns decided to impose their language on others. This might have been a literal imposition, as in banning the local language and forcing children to learn a different dialect, as happened in the modern era. But it might have also been soft pressure to skew your pronunciation and grammar towards the way your neighbors spoke. As new community units and regional identities formed, speech patterns developed to express these identities, and occasionally various varieties contributed to the final result.
This is an important point I completely overlooked. Alfonso VII grew up in Galicia, and was crowned King of Galicia at 7 years-old, so he probably spoke a dialect very similar to that of Alfonso I of Portugal.
Yes! Haha, I wrote all the names in Spanish first and then I went back and changed them to English, but forgot to add back the Leon bit. It's interesting Alfonso isn't anglicized to something like Alphonse. Isabel la Cat√≥lica seems to be more commonly referred to as Isabella I of Castille and Alfonso el Sabio as just Alfonso X.
