He goes on to claim that Manchus were outright bankrupting themselves to feed their apparent meat addiction (the general presentation is eerily similar to later narratives of opium addiction), to the point where they couldn't even afford clothing and grain!
I'm honestly amazed they haven't gone to Japan yet. Considering actual Ninjas and how popular Samurai can be. Vikings feels a little bit like jumping on a bandwagon.
There would also be private letters, and the claimant might seize those to protect their predecessor's reputation (say, from revelations of a mistress) or their own (if the predecessor favoured someone else), or just to protect the family's privacy and that mystique which was a large part of how royalty functioned (crayon stick-men drawn by the heir as a toddler might have been nice mementos for grandpappy emperor, but not really something you want in public when you take the throne twenty years later ...).
How were Manchus eating their meat? Were they just cooking it by itself, or were they blending it with more Chinese styles sort of like the meat-heavy dishes found in Americanized Chinese restaurants?
