So, to begin we have to get an idea of early De-nazification. The official beginnings of the term denazification originated at the pentagon prior to the end of ww2 in 1943, referring to how the legal system of the new Germany would have to be adjusted. \[1\] Later it was expanded to include ideological cleansing of nazi ideas. Adults and youth around the age of 12 and up would have been expected to view films produced by the Americans as a sort of 'shock therapy sensitivity training' where videos of the concentration camps and other such films would be shown to give humanity to the victims of the holocaust and by proxy humiliate or shame those who had previously supported nazi measures, including youth who had little idea of the brutal realities of what extermination meant for a population besides them simply being gone \[2\].
This is exactly the info I wanted to know, thank you. If I may, could you expand more on there being a very clear effort to not blame the children and adults who were unaware of the full extent of the concentration camps, especially the bit about Versailles?
