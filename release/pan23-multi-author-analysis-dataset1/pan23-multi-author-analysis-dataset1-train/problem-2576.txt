I am not all that impressed with Evers. That being said, I'll vote for him, he should have backed Barnes and other Wisconsin Dems more. He can do it alone.

Unfortunately Republicans hold an overwhelming majority in the wisconsin state assembly and senate because of gerrymandering. Evers is only able to veto their stuff by the thinnest of margins, they almost won a supermajority that could've overriden his veto power. So it'll be another 4 years of Evers begging them to do something good for wisconsin and the Republicans will not even do their jobs. Evers tried to get them to do something about guns by calling special sessions and the Republicans just gavel in and gavel out the session within minutes.
