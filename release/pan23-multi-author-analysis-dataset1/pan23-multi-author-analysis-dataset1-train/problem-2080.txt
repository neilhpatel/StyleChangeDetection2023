Have you told your insurance what he’s doing? If he’s double dipping by filing claims with the insurance and then charging you an inflated copay rate where he pockets the difference that’s likely against the rules of his contract with the insurance company. If he’s charging you this extra amount on the copay because the insurance company contract states they’ll cover a lower amount than his standard out of pocket rate, that’s balance billing and is illegal in some states and may also be against his contract.
Mental health. He is part of an org that is in network and they’ve reimbursed him at their designated rate. When we started working together he said that he would submit my claims “as a favor” and would reimburse any payment he received from them. It’s super sketchy and I feel stupid for trusting him now.
Exactly. Thanks for mentioning the filing limit. Time is of the essence here. Though they may make an exception if what this provider is doing is against contract. Definitely act fast and keep regular contact with your insurance company.
