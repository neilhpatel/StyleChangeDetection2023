The simple explanation is that for one reason or another, 'Dynasty' is the word that English has opted to use to translate the Chinese term chao 朝. In practical terms, though, the Chinese term really refers to the state, either a particular state if prefaced with the name of a particular one, or in the abstract if used alone. In origin at least, the Chinese didn't conceive of the idea that, for instance, the Zhu dynasty (small-d) ruled the Ming Dynasty (big-D) – rather, the imperial family (Huangzu 皇族), surnamed Zhu 朱, ruled the Great Ming (Daming 大明), or the Ming State (Mingchao 明朝). As for why 'Dynasty' has been retained, familiarity by Western scholars is one explanation; another could well be, from the Chinese side, modern nationalism attempting to portray China as a continuous state ruled by a succession of dynasties, and so opting to retain the English term to emphasise such continuity. There are cases in which there has been a move from 'dynasty' towards 'empire', or even, in the case of the Jin, Yuan, Ming and Qing, even straight up using their proper name of 'Great X' – scholarship on the Qing in particular has tended to gravitate away from 'dynasty' towards 'empire' or 'Great Qing', though this has much to do with trying not to assert undue continuities between the Manchu-established Qing state and its Han Chinese predecessors.
The character as far as I know means "morning". Does it have anything to do with the daily morning government meeting of the emperor and his subjects (早朝/朝見)? Maybe the translation should be "government" or "court" (朝廷)?
