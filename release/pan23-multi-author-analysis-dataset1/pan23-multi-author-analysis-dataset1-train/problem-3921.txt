But one of the problems we tend to face in history is the idea it's somehow cool or better for women to do non-women's history--the historiographical version of "one of the guys.".
What is the Women's studies/Women's History field's response to critics (mostly feminist-adjacent in a broad sense, politically) who reject Women's studies on the basis of rejecting categories of gender and sex as fundamentally oppressive?
Just want to stop by and thank you all. As a woman redditor I am always excited to see fellow women standing up and speaking up as experts in their field; I’m in a field that is predominantly female and still experience sexism. I can only imagine what it’s like for you all.
I don't know if it's appropriate for me to comment on this post, since I'm a man, but I want to thank you for your very important labor as moderators here, and more broadly as the historians who make us see and understand the vital role women and other forgotten figures such as minorities have in history. Within the fields I'm more interested in, I have to commend books such as The Battle Cry of Freedom, American Revolutions, and Americanos: Latin America's Struggle for Independence, all of which dedicate pages to examining the roles of women. There are many brave women in the history of my country, such as Manuelita Saenz, and I would like to know more of her. There's still a long way to go, especially in the patriarchal society of my country, but with the efforts of women such as you, I think we will get there eventually, and have a history that truly includes all of us. Thank you very much, again.
