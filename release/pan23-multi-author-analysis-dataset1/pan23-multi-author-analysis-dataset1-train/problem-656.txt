i cant speak for the mary part of the catholic church as im not catholic but worshipping the crucifix is an easy one. Back in the older days of the faith, they changed symbols constantly that meant different meanings depending on where they are adopted from. At one point the faith used a pentagram due to its spiritual connection to the elements and the human soul. In response, an inverted pentagram came to exist as an anti church protest symbol. response? they made the inverted pentagram a satanic symbol. You see the same treatment of the Cross and inverted cross. Different Crosses have been used by different sects, some of which were denounced by each other. The Ichthys or jesus fish is just another symbol adopted by a Jesus oriented faith even though its origins date back to the 2nd century, its gotten more popular in the modern day due to the darker nature of the cross. It was actually used BEFORE the cross/crucifix was adopted, around the 11th century and really took off in the 14th. So they didnt really start that whole crucifix shit till a good 1000 years after jesus, most likely as a form of intimidation and control.

Constantly projecting. Every time they project onto us (blueanon for example), it’s an admission of guilt. They’re into q anon so they think everybody else is too, even the libruls.
