I also mention in the reply above that dyebaths were often used for several rounds of dyeing, with the most costly articles dyed in the first round and less costly ones dyed in subsequent "dips" (known as exhaust baths), leading to the phenomenon of more muted shades being associated with lower-class items.
Thank you, again. I think I learned quite a bit, including things I hadn't thought about (I hadn't thought about the access to proper needles as something that could affect who could do embroider in clothes, I allways assumed it was about the cost of the thread in the case of most delicate materials and the hours needed to create intrincate works).
There is a 16th? century (I think) play called "Gammer Gurton's Needle" that really drove home to me just how treasured needles were. You can certainly make needles out of bone (I've even tried one out), but those tended to be used more for things like naalbinding. Might work for one of the simple seam covering stitches, but not so much for any of the stem stitch motifs.
