There have been several races that definitely feel more stupid than the rest. Georgia senate is a big one, obviously this one in Colorado. In our state it was a rep who was literally recorded on film discussing on a podcast about women being chocked to death during sex. I'm all for a good, safe kinky life, but if you want my vote and are giggling about someone dying during sex the same way you'd giggle at the word "breasts" in sex ed. I'm gonna question everyone who votes for you. Also, he had no policy or brain cells beyond this and has been noted as someone who IG follows underage girls, too. His main claim to fame was stopping a "terrorist" on a train once that apparently is being turned into a movie. Him getting votes at all is a reminder that no matter how much you want to believe your neighbors are smart, they are not.

Congratulations, Republicans. You may have lost this congressional seat as a direct result of killing your own voters.
