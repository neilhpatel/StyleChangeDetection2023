Fun fact, the Koch brother’s hated Reagan because he didn’t go far enough for them. It’s one of the reasons they backed the Federalist Society to influence law schools and started funding “free market economics” courses at top business schools. They figured that if their ideology was adopted by leaders in the legal and business professions then they’d eventually win their fight against the government. That the GOP couldn’t refuse their requests if the next wave of legislators and businessmen agreed with being more extreme than Reagan. Getting a majority of Supreme Court justices to be members of the Federalist Society was a huge win for them.
Exactly. I always say about religion and government: I like many different religions for the moral guidelines they instill, and I like most systems of government for their ability to make widespread decision making more efficient. But in both cases, add people to the mix, and it all goes to heck.
