Julian died at the end of June in what's now north-central Iraq, 100 km or so beyond the Roman frontier. After a day of confusion, during which a new emperor - Jovian - was selected - and further delays caused by Persian attacks on the Roman camp, the news would have begun its race westward, moving, like the goddess Rumor in the Aeneid, as fast as tongues could carry it. Let's say, since we have to say something, that the first courier crossed the frontier a week after Julian's death. Two or three days of swift riding would have carried him and his tidings to Antioch, metropolis of Roman Syria, and to the port at Seleucia Pieria. From thence, on the first fast ships, the news would have begun its progress across the Roman world. You can play with different scenarios on the ORBIS model - which tends, by applying a standard rate of travel, to underestimate average transit times - but it seems reasonable to assume that the news reached Rome about a month after Julian's death. Then, of course, it had to make the voyage out to Lusitania. Under ideal conditions, as the ORBIS model tells us, a voyage from Rome to Bracara could be accomplished in as little as 11 days. But it's far more likely that the news reached Bracara much more gradually, probably by a merchant who heard it at one of the major Iberian ports.
Interesting question. Please note that my field of expertise is on the second century of the Roman Empire and not so much the late Empire. The roman road network (Cursus Publicus) is a fascinating topic and has been studied for a long time.
