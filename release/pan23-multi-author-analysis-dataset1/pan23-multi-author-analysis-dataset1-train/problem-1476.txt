Look up the Siddhaṃ script, which was how the early Buddhist texts were written and delivered to China and Japan. The tradition is that the pseudo-legendary/pseudo-historical Buddhist monk Kukai invented the kana after recognizing the benefits of a phonetic writing system. In actual history, it was likely an evolution of, as I said, using the actual Chinese characters in a novel way to represent the critical parts of Japanese grammar. Man'youganas are much like the hieroglyphic practice of using some characters phonetically rather than for their logographic meaning, but note that it had a stigma for a long time. The educated elite felt that one should just understand all the additional Japanese grammatical elements from context. It wasn't until Buddhism really took hold that kana gained a wider acceptance. Also note that the Siddham system organizes its letters along exactly the same sort of grid that kana does. Ultimately, it comes from Sanskrit. Even today, Japanese Buddhist monks write with Siddham for some holy texts. They call it 梵字.
So, from the above there are 3 key takeaways: firstly, the earliest writing systems were logographic; secondly, as writing systems are adopted for use with new languages, they were also adapted for use, and in particular more logographic systems are adapted to be more phonetic; thirdly, most writing systems in use today evolved from Egyptian hieroglyphs, notable exceptions being Hanzi and Kanji. And based on those three things we can develop answers to your questions.
