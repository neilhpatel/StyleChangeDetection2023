Yes its legitimate, I called the census bureau phone line and they confirmed that I’m on that list and said that the census taker is legally allowed to be there to take the survey. I’ll see if I can get someone on the phone that I can complain to about their behavior, but the person I talked to didn’t seem concerned with their persistence and just told me they are a federal employee and are legally allowed to conduct the census.
No, this is weird. As someone else mentioned in this thread, these people should be making a reasonable effort to get the info and then moving on. They get paid to collect info, not to loiter, not to harass and accost people. So all other things being equal, either they're scamming hours or they're being creepy (the census taker) and dumb (the supervisor) or god knows what, but you should complain and report to everyone.
It is really, really weird that they would waste their time like this, and given how weird it is, you should complain to the census and the police that this seems weird and makes you uncomfortable.
