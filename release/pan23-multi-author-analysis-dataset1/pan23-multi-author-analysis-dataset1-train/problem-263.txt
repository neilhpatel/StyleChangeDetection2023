Bottom line is you need to look at the language of the provision - not just a partial sentence within it. Non-competes are normal, run of the mill, provisions which generally hold water so long as the restrictions imposed by it are reasonable in scope.
As said before, non-competes are enforceable so long as the geographic and time restraints are “reasonable”. Each state decides what that means.
“Employee and Employer acknowledge and agree that the employment of Employee hereunder requires substantial investment of time and capital of the Employer. The intent of this Employment Agreement is to provide for the mutually satisfactory growth of the practice of the Employer; however, it is mutually recognized by both parties that in the event of the termination of the employment, the Employer will suffer a loss of their business by virtue of the development of close relationship between the Employee and the clients of the Employer. In recognition of the foregoing, therefore, the Employee agrees that if he shall be terminated from employment with Employer, the Employee agrees not to [work in specific geographic area] for [a specific period of time].”.
