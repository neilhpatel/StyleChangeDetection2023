The debt is money America owes to itself and thats not a bad thing. Its mostly treasury bonds that Americans have purchased for investment either for retirement or to buy a home or anything really. Its safe and its secure. But the GOP doesn't want that money safe and secure in government bonds where they can't get at it. They want it dumped into the markets propping up the corporations they own so they can use it to profit off of. By threatening to default they will collapse the bond market. So where's all that money going to go? Into the stock markets, exactly where they want it.
This also means that, if Republicans cut Social Security but keep it for current retirees (to avoid angering their elderly base), then we'll all need to continue paying into Social Security as well as whatever new retirement program is recommended.
This is scumbag shit. A vile hatred for those that depend on social security being there. What if we just, like, made the rich pay taxes to the point where it's the same impact that the low and middle class feel? When I pay taxes, I go from being able to easily afford rent to barely being able to afford rent. When a rich person pays their taxes, they can only own 9 houses instead of 10.
