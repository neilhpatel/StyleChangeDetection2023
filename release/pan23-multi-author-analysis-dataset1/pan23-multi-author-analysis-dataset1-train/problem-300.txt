The usual response I get when I argue thus is: but Christians are also bigoted, and it’s racist, however one can be racist against a religion, to only assume that one religion is “bad”. That is not what I am saying. The US has a massive problem with fundamentalism up into the highest ranks of their government. The overthrow of Roe v Wade is a tragedy for everyone. But what does that tell us? Should we add more religion into the mix or should we deal in ways that prevents exactly that? In Europe, we don’t have the same problem of white nationalist Christians. It shows us an extreme case of how popular and potent radical religious believes are today, and I think we are all better off in combating the rise of fundamentalism in every way. Religious teachings should be expunged from every school. State and religion need to be separated radically. Many of the Islamic institutions in Europe are funded by Saudi Arabia: (this is only one source of many if you don’t want to believe it).
Every religion, political party, etc. has its crazies. While not religious myself, religion provides comfort and solace to a great number of people. I've nothing against it.
Resolving differences??? In what world is burning someone’s most cherished symbol supposed to be a step towards resolving differences??? You sound like an accelerationist.
