First and foremost I simply advocate for worker ownership of the means of production. Capitalist liberal democracies are closer to fascism than communism is. The modern popular conception of communism is so warped from a century of propaganda and suppression that it no longer even begins to resemble what communists actually advocate for. Something which hasn't changed since Marx. That is a socialism, first and foremost, followed by a movement towards global communism, that is a classless, moneyless, stateless society.
Are you kidding? The GOP will eat this up. The GOP-aligned propaganda outfits (Tucker Carlson being the most prominent) have shown a notable streak of pro-Russia propaganda lately. I would not be surprised if they twisted the truth, pointed to this resolution and said "See? Ukrainians are all Nazis!".
Worker ownership of the means of production stagnated technological advancements and kept anyone outside the authoritarian elites from having any sense of individual freedom and political power.
