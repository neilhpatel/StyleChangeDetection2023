The specific wording is "Dear Tenant(censoring names) As you know, your twelve month lease expires August 31st 2022. Management is not renewing your lease. Please accept this letter as your more than 30 day notice that Management is terminating your lease, effective December 31, 2021. You are still responsible for the rent of December 2021. You have ample time to find a new home. Failure to comply will result in management taking additional action.".
Generally, if a landlord wants someone out earlier than the end-date of their lease, they'd have to get the tenant(s) to agree to that, or they'd have to evict them (which would require legal justification for terminating the lease early).
If you have a lease that runs through August of 2022, and that lease does not say that the landlord can terminate it early, then presumably, you have a legal right to inhabit that apartment until at least August of 2022.
But until then, there may not be much to do outside of informing the landlord that your lease entitles you to live there, provided you're not violating the lease in some way, until August 2022, and then waiting to see what the landlord's next move is.
From what you've written, it certainly sounds like the landlord doesn't have a bona fide, legally-justified reason for an eviction, but an eviction lawsuit takes time and is generally something one doesn't want to go through, even if they can successfully defend against it.
You can either agree to leave in December, or you can wait for them to attempt to evict you -- again, unless you're in violation of your lease, they're going to have to have good, justifiable, legal reason for a judge to agree that you need to be evicted, and "their kid is loud, sometimes" may not rise to that level.
