"Torc" also just means twisty. "Torquis" is from the verb torqueo, to twist, turn around, which is the same as the meaning of the verb στρέφω, from which στρεπτός is derived. A torc is just a twisted piece of metal.
It's most likely that the "divers colours" of Boudicca's tunic were arranged in a checked pattern not completely dissimilar from a modern tartan - while the ancientness of the concept of "clan tartans" has been hugely exaggerated by the tourist and tartan industries, complicated patterns of checks with color changes in the warp and weft seem to have been widely worn in Northern Europe for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Elaborate checked patterns with multiple colors could be more expensive and therefore a sign of status; a high-status woman like Boudicca might have added to the impressiveness of her tunic by having a check pattern that included imported dyestuffs like saffron and kermes - more vibrant yellows and reds. There could also have been tablet woven bands, possibly in contrasting colors, applied to the edges of the sleeves or neckline. It wouldn't be unlikely for the mantle to have been checked as well, although the fact that it's not mentioned by Dio could imply that it was not patterned at all or that the observers who passed along the story didn't notice a pattern/check because it was more toned down or involved two similar colors. It could also have been patterned very subtly with threads spun in different directions but dyed the same color, something we see in some textile fragments of the era. Her necklace could have been a torc, a neck ring with an opening that often had a decorative knob at either side, a piece of jewelry particularly associated with the Gauls and other Celtic cultures.
