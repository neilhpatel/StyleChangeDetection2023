The series should have spent less time on anecdotes about Lee and Jackson, spent more time and gone into more depth on the intransigence of the south , which first insisted on keeping and even expanding slavery in the decades before the war, and which after the war still went to great lenhs to keep as much of its slave society as possible. Watch the series, but I would recommend Joanne B. Freeman's The Field of Blood , to get an idea of the violence even before the war, and Eric Foner's Reconstruction, to get a good picture of the Southern resistance afterwards- and eventual Northern acquiescence to that resistance .
thanks! I found your meta review a little after posting. It sounds like it's a mostly enjoyable, decent recounting of the battles that would interest me, but pretty shallow when it comes to things not concerning battle. From what I gather I think it's something I'd enjoy and seems like a jumping off point if I want to further delve into the American Civil Wars history, as long as I have those caveats in mind while watching.
