The US’s entire military budget for the past 70 years has been focused on defeating Russia and destroying Russia’s ability to wage war. The war in Ukraine has seen that budget do exactly what it was made for, and without American lives being lost to do so. Anyone who claims this money is not worth it is an out and out idiot. This is exactly what this giant defense budget has always been for.
It's nice to know we're not the bullies in this situation and we're actually making the playground a better place by sticking up for the smaller guy and we're getting our fill of the capitalist pie, everyone is happy to support them (I don't include the Q chucklefucks as real people).
Same. Every conservative I know supports Ukraine. I keep looking for those that are against it and I just don't see them in my day to day. I know they are out there somewhere but they are not the massive group others claim them to be. I actually know more liberals against it because they want that money spend on social programs. Not everything is cut and dry.
