The disasters of the Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Uprising should not be understood as a failure of modernisation on a technological level, but rather of institutional problems marring the Qing armed forces. The naval aspect is probably the most often highlighted. The destruction of the Qing fleet at the Battle of the Yalu River can in part be attributed to simple bad luck (a Japanese shell hit the bridge of the Qing flagship and disabled the fleet's command crew) and certain technical disparities (the Japanese guns were smaller but faster-firing). However, the major shortcomings seem to have been the side effects of corruption, namely Qing shells being filled with dud material rather than actual high explosive, as well as poor officership. This flaw existed both at the level of ship captains, who basically scattered after the loss of Ding's flagship, and at the level of senior leadership, with Ding himself having made the somewhat inexplicable choice to deploy his fleet in a wedge rather than a line. This poor officership was partly the result of the fact that the modernised Qing fleets never developed a distinct naval culture, unlike the Japanese navy, and this is reflected in the relative interchangeability of officers in the Qing service: Ding Ruchang, the fleet's admiral, had fought as a cavalry officer under Li Hongzhang against the Taiping and Nian; a survivor of the Battle of the Yalu River, Li Yuanhong, had been trained at the Tianjin Naval Academy, but after the war went on to receive a series of army assignments in Hubei under Zhang Zhidong.
So it was reasonable Ding deployed his fleet in a wedge. In other words Qing fleet had been designed for fighting by wedge formation and Ding had no other choice.
