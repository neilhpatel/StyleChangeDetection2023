By 1945, the war in Manchuria had long been over, and most of the best divisions had been transferred to China or elsewhere in the Pacific. In the previous few months, 5 divisions had been transferred from Manchuria to Kyushu in preparation for the Americans. When Suzuki asked Lt Gen. Sumihisa Ikeda, who had recently transferred from Manchuria if the Kwantung army could repulse the Soviets, he replied, "The Kwantung Army is hopeless.".
If Japan had surrendered about a month later, the above considerations give an estimate of about 250,000 civilians deaths in China and occupied Asia, and about 300,000 additional Japanese military deaths, without including further civilian deaths in Manchuria or deaths in Japan from US (non-atomic) bombing. it seems quite reasonable to claim that the atomic bombings accelerated the Japanese surrender, and in doing so saved lives.
The surrender also stopped the fighting in Manchuria, saving many Japanese lives (and also many Soviet lives and civilian lives). The Japanese forces in Manchuria fought hard, but generally did not fight to the death. Estimating Japanese military deaths as the geometric mean of the Japanese and Soviet claims, about half of the Japanese troops who fought the Soviets died, and about half surrendered. Approximately 600,000 Japanese troops were interned by the Soviets after the surrender; we can estimate that if they had fought, there might have been another 300,000 Japanese military deaths. There would have been many Soviet and civilian deaths, too.
