I would talk to a lawyer to see what they suggest. But because she's threatened to self harm to get you arrested, that's a whole other area. You may be able to have her checked for dementia, and the possibly get a RO. She may try to do things to get you kicked out of your apartment (if I can't live here, neither can you). Maybe talk to the landlord. If he wants to enforce the lease and put out a non-listed tenant. (He might be able to say there's a clause that you can't do it, even if it's not there, just to help, if they are friendly enough.).
I've had to threaten her with a lawsuit for her to pay me back for a scam she pulled on me when I was 18, that cost me 150k, it drained her savings paying me back and literally no one else in the family is willing to take her in (she's incredibly toxic).
2. If the case she poses a real and continuing threat to your physical safety while in your home— example: repeated harassment that escalates — first call police each time this happens to obtain a report, if immediate danger — can look into obtaining TRO (temporary restraining order), as TRO usually come with the stipulation of not having a person w/in so and so feet or distance of the party who filed the TRO.
I am NAL. Just a realtor and a landlord that dealt with crazy situations. If she does establish residency. You do have to follow legal procedures to get her out. You will need a lawyer to advise you on the proper steps.
