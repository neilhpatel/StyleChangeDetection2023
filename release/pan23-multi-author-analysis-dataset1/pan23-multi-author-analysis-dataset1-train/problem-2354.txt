Yea I agree. There's really nothing worth entertaining that the Republican party has offered... Even the more moderate members running for office in MA. My wife and I sat down, looked at each candidate, and there was literally zero reason to vote Republican. None. Pretty much the only reason to vote R these days is literally because of QAnon, MAGA, racism, sexism, or homophobia. Massachusetts is the most educated state full of a ton of different cultures so the whole "southern strategy"("we can't be blatantly racist so we are subtly racist") thing just doesn't make sense here. Abolishing the party is perfectly reasonable.
Why? What is there to salvage? Why do people discuss it as something worth preserving? We have seen everything they stand for and are capable of for decades and it's all shit.
