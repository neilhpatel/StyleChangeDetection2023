They were not. Australia is enormous, and its peoples, climates and landscapes are incredibly diverse, and precolonial Indigenous culture was inherently conservative, mostly rejecting new ideas in favour of preserving ancient customs. The hunter-gatherer lifestyle may have been significantly more complex than most people (including academics) realise, and substantially different in some key locations across Australia, but for most precolonial Australians it was primarily hunting and gathering. When they were presented with the possibility of farming and village living by foreign cultures, they mostly rejected them - it had nothing to do with capability or intelligence and everything to do with tradition and choice. Indigenous Australia doesn't need a history of villages and agriculture to be impressive or deserving of respect.
Excellent explanation of a complicated topic and the accompanying literature. I hate absolutes with things like this since of course there is variation in human behaviour across thousands of disparate tribal groups!
