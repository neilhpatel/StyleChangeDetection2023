If you are actually sued, however, you do need to respond, and you should consider getting professional legal advice. It's safe to assume that your former CEO is just full of shit at this point, but if you are actually served with a complaint, don't ignore it, or you will find yourself with a default judgement against you regardless of the lack of merit in your former CEO's case. It's very unlikely you'll receive such a complaint, though, as people are far more likely to talk about suing someone than to actually go through with it.
You could be sued, but the chances of him winning are slim to none, especially if you haven't been involved in the departure of those other employees in any way. (Even if you had been involved in referring them to their new jobs, unless you signed an agreement with your former employer prohibiting that action, it's very unlikely your actions would be found wrongful, as employment in Florida is at-will, so he'd still have little chance of success...).
NAL. I would imagine his threats are toothless. Just the rantings of an employer whose business is in decline.
