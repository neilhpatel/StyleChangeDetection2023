Depending on state you may be a mandated reporter and legally required to report suspected abuse and could face repercussions for not doing so…I’m my state there is a 1-800 number that we are to call to report suspected child abuse and in my state in positions such as teachers or counselors we are mandated to complete this training every 5 years that explains when and how to report.
Thank you! Why is taking photos considered a bad idea? I was planning on taking pictures of all of the kids for halloween next week and whatever pics of him will be with all of the kids.
Also, document. Your school probably has a form to fill out when you call, but if not document on your own. Be as detailed as possible in terms of everything you see and anything he says. For example, not "he said mom and boyfriend were beating him." Instead, "I saw student had a bruise above his right eye on entering the classroom at approximately 9:30 AM on 10-17-21. I asked him what happened. Student reported to me within hearing of X that his mom's boyfriend George had struck him with a closed fist, because student had forgotten to take out the trash. Bruise was approximately 2 inches wide by 1 inch tall, and a purple-blue color. Student had been out the previous 3 days.".
So many reasons- taking photos of minors without parent consent, it can be seen as you conducting your own investigation (which is interfering with a law enforcement or DHS investigation), depending where the injuries are, photographing them could fall into child pornography territory, etc.
Thank you for this. We’re taking pictures next week for halloween. Would it be a good idea if I send over his pictures to CPS to help with the investigation.
