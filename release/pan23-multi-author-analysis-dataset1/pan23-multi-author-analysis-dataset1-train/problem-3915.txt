Not once the benefits have already been paid out, they can’t be unpaid. Edit: because you have received the money to pay for school, the benefit has been “used” and it belongs to you to use for that purpose, school. It cannot be rescinded now. It’s yours.
And yes your father could revoke the transfer after the use - I've seen this done more than one time - VA will then send the school a debt letter for the tuition and you (a minor who can't be held responsible for this debt) and your parents a debt for the MHA and Book/Supply stipend paid to you (them) - the school would also create a debt on you/them for the tuition.
Get a job. Do what you need to do to take care of yourself until the VA money is returned to you. Also, get your personal documents, open a safety deposit box, again as soon as you turn 18, and put them in there.
Also, if you're not able to now, open a personal bank account at a bank no one in your family uses the minute you turn 18. Clear out the one your mom has access to, if there is anything left in it.
