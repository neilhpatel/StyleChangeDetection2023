I was in Vegas on the strip this summer on vacation, and just walking around I witnessed two crimes in the middle of the day around noon. One lady had her purse snatched, and a homeless guy dressed as a clown was assaulted by a black tourist passing by who just didn't like him for some reason. Police were no where to be found, never saw them at all on the strip. I know this is just a personal anecdote, but if the strip is this unsafe during the day I can only imagine how bad it is at night. I went to my hotel room after 9 PM.
BS...republicans have claimed democrats are "soft on crime" for generations, forcing democrats to move to the right and increasing our prison population to 1 in the world in numbers and proportion to our population...democrats have yet to find an answer that works mostly because it would implicate those who pay for the elections...as poverty increases property crimes while inequalities increase violent crimes...
Don't bother. The Republicans are rural dominant, and have thus evolved a strategy of blaming the inevitably blue cities for high crime rates in red states. On one hand, it's correct that Democrat cities have high crime.....because cities always have higher crime, and Dems almost always control cities. Lies, damned lies, and statistics.
