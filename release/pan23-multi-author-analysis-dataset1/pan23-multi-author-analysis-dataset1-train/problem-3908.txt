I have been teaching as a professor at a community college for three or so years, so I am a bit familiar with what some students come away with from HS. I would say a good place to start would be to emphasize the evolution of things. If students can understand how history builds on itself and how no event exists in a vacuum, I think they can better grasp key events. I also agree that some philosophy should be added into the curriculum. Understanding Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, Lenin, and Mao could go a long way in grasping the conflicts of the last few centuries. Finally, I think there is a need to emphasize the dangers of anachronisms and applying modern standards backwards. I am all for analyzing historical figures and their faults, but I have increasingly found students making judgements of historical figures based on modern conceptions of morality and ethics. Once again it goes back to the idea of evolution and development. Figures like Columbus must be examined and frankly denounced, but to only focus on specific aspects fails to give the full picture. To offer another example, I remember distinctly learning in HS about Jefferson and his impact on the revolution, but never really learned about his ownership and rape of slaves. All historical figures are multi-dimensional and understanding that (without solely using modern conceptions) I believe will very much help high school students and the field of history in general. I think ultimately, what I am getting at is students need to understand the full context (or as much as possible) of events and people. Otherwise, by college they are stuck in narrow viewpoints of history.
Financially? It is impossible. I did it only because I have a family (parents and in-laws) willing to help and because we use state support. If you have a family, graduate school is impossible unless the second works outside the home. Full-time Grad school is an economic nightmare even if you don't have kids. With them, it is worse.
