3.375% here. Bought in a suburb of Flint at the height of the water crisis. Water was fine here, but it absolutely cratered home values everywhere in the county anyway. Only way you could get me out of this place is if I were to build a better home elsewhere, and even then I'll probably mortgage this one again and build the second one using equity in this house, followed by working with a property manager to rent this one out.

The market is nowhere near large enough to serve everyone who wants to own due to corporations and groups buying real estate whether to serve as rentals as you mentioned or simply as investment/tax shelters/money laundering, and prices are squeezed. Everyone wins except the buyer, as usual.
