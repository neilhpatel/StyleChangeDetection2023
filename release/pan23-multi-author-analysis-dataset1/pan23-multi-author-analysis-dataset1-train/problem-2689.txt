No title insurance, we live in Iowa and title insurance is different. I haven’t had much luck finding a good real estate lawyer but i’ll keep looking. Thanks for the comment.
Under IA law, mortgages used to purchase a property take priority over refinance mortgages in foreclosure proceedings because "a mortgage given to secure funds which are used to pay off another mortgage is not a purchase money mortgage." (). I'm NAL, but I think this could mean that the "first" refinanced mortgage is actually wiped out by the foreclosure of the "second" purchase money mortgage, even though the "first" mortgage was actually recorded before the "second" mortgage. Again, which mortgage has priority in a foreclosure depends on the totality of the circumstances and is decided by the court.
Still, you might be correct that a buyer at a mortgage foreclosure sale must undertake due diligence to ensure that there are no higher priority liens.
On the other hand, it seems more reasonable to notify everyone at the foreclosure sale of higher priority liens. It seems terribly inefficient to force everyone to do their own searches a the county recorder's office. Why snare unsuspecting good faith purchasers?
