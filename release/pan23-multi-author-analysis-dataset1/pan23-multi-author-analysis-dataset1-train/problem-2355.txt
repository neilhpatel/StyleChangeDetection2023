I'm always amazed when such a specific question gets a response that manages to answer not only the question itself, but also a ton of details that I started to wonder about when reading the OP. Thank you for taking the time!
What I was trying to get across is that in the popular understanding of that skit, I think the satire gets lost in the understanding and more than a few people genuinely do think that the coming of the Roman Empire (and empires more generally) meant the bringing of sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, and public health.
There are three caveats. First, the troops Brasidas brought to Amphipolis were not Spartan citizens, but neodamodeis - helots who served abroad to gain their freedom. It is possible that the Spartiates themselves actually didn't carry the lambda blazon, but only issued it to helots when they armed them to fight as hoplites. Second, Xenophon actually describes the Spartan shield to some extent in his Constitution of the Spartans, noting that it was always covered with bronze and polished to a high shine to terrify the enemy - but he never says anything about any blazon. Third, Plutarch preserves an anecdote about a Spartan whose shield blazon was a life-sized fly, offering various colourful explanations for the choice. If this is a true story, it would mean that Spartans could in fact choose their own shield blazon (or adjust it to their tastes). Unfortunately this is only an inference from an even less reliable source (mainly because we cannot date the anecdote), which is why most scholars have opted to keep Eupolis and dismiss Plutarch on this point.
