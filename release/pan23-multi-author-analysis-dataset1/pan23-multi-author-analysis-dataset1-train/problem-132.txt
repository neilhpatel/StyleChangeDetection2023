That means Germany is currently not importing any fossil fuels from Russia. They stopped importing Russian coal in summer. Russia cut natural gas pipeline deliveries to zero in autumn. The EU banned seaborne oil imports from Russia from early December and now Germany stopped importing Russian pipeline oil as well.
Honestly... Neither China nor India are usually crude oil exporters on a relevant scale. Some -especially in India- companies make a profit with refined oil products based on cheap Russian oil (mostly at the expense of their domestic public companies that are operating more on long-term contracts).
What? German had an energy dependence on Russia. They couldn't have done this without some huge favors of their friends and risking destroying their industry and freezing during a cold winter. Energy prices are still out of control.
Only partially. Germany and Austria were actually the only two EU members in favor of NS2 so singling out Germany did not come from nowhere. Germany was not the only ones dependent on Russia but they and Austria were the most outspoken defenders of a continued dependence on Russia. If you openly defend something you should not be surprised when people point the blame at you even if others relied heavily on Russia too. Some countries like Poland even increased their import of Russian gas during the same time but they did so on the sly.
