Yeah right. Trump will just run as a third party or some not insignificant portion of his base won't vote out of protest over the RINO traitors like DeSantis. DeSantis could win the nomination, and a week later video footage of Little Ronnie phone banking for Trump would drop. No one crosses the mob boss.

Weisselberg's testimony has not implicated Trump was part of the tax scheme criminal conspiracy, so unless the civil suit against the Trumg Org uncovers new info that Trump was part of the scheme to defraud banks by elevating the value of assets, it is unlikely he will be charged criminally as an individual in NY.
