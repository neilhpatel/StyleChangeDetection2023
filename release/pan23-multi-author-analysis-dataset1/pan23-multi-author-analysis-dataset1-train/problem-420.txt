The "right thing to do" to "keep the peace" is for the Aunts to shut it. The only person disturbing the peace is Aunt 2. She's the one picking fights. If she wants peace all she needs to do is to do nothing.
Not necessarily, because people do give gifts to others, but if I were doing it, Iâ€™d want to make that clear somehow in writing that this is a gift of some sort for some other purpose and not having to do with any claim to his estate and include a waiver (as someone else responded with before my response here).
Exact same scenario when my father died. My older sister was the executor. My dad had a fair amount of gold coins and his will specifically said it was to be divided equally among the living children. My sister (Executor) then announced that "Daddy wanted her to have some extra gold." We absolutely knew this would not hold up if we challenged it. But to keep peace, we went along with it.
Even in the jurisdictions that do allow for family members to contest wills on the basis they reasonably expected to be provided for, this typically only applies to dependents such as spouses or children. It would take some very compelling circumstances for the sibling of a deceased person to ever convince a court they should have any claim, especially if they weren't specifically included in the will. Still, speak to an estate lawyer for peace of mind.
