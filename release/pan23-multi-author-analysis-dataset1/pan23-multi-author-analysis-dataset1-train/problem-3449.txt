In 1901, a grave was found in the proximities of Sycamore Terrace in York. Buried inside a stone coffin was the remains of a young woman, approximately 18 to 23 years old. Cause of death is unknown. The grave goods that she was buried with, which included locally produced goods and exotic jewellery made of ivory, points to the woman coming from a wealthy background. In addition to this, a "rectangular fragmentary openwork mount of bone" was found, that read "S[OR]OR AVE VIVAS IN DEO", translated as "Hail, sister, may you live in God". The goods were all dated to the late 3rd century AD - 4th century AD. An analysis of the woman's remains made in 2009 and published in Antiquity (see sources below) suggests that she was likely a bi-racial woman of North African ancestry. The Ivory Bangle lady certainly wouldn't be alone in that ancestry, however. Scientific tests of other skeletons from Roman graveyards in Great Britain included several remains of people of African ancestry, some of which had been excavated in York.
The earliest evidence of the presence of individuals of African ancestry in what is today Great Britain comes from Roman Britain. We have several archaeological pieces of evidence that point towards a remarkable presence that throws additional light into the diverse and multicultural society of the Roman Empire during approximately the 3rd and 4th century AD.
Do you happen to know which isotope system was used here? I'm am unfamiliar with radioisotope systems that would corroborate living place in this way, compared to stable isotope systems like Sr for instance that could.
For other people who stumble on this discussion, Sr coupled with other stable isotopes is commonly used in this kind of study - determining where creatures lived. It's even been used to reconstruct migration patterns amungst dinosaurs!
