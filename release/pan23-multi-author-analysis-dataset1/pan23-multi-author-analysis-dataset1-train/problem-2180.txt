Firstly, it's important to remember that the Supreme Governor of the Church of England - The Queen - awarded MBEs to the Beatles in 1965, which at the time was sort of seen as an apology for taxing their earnings so heavily. Judging by a 2021 article by Marcus Collins in Popular Music, The Beatles certainly were criticised by religious conservatives in the UK - Malcolm Muggeridge (later famous for a televised debate with Michael Palin and John Cleese over Life Of Brian) argued that the Beatles phenomenon was essentially 'the bad dreams of a materialistic society', while the English Catholic Christopher Booker thought that Beatlemania was indicative of the declining psychic health of England, brought on by declining class distinctions and decolonisation.
Fantastic answer and one of the best I've read in this sub. Thank you very much. I have a few questions though.
The geographical location of the radio stations that banned the Beatles from their airwaves also tells a similar story: Stephens mentions WRNB in New Bern, North Carolina, WAKY in Louisville, Kentucky, KOB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, WAQY in Birmingham, Alabama, two stations in Texas, and one station in South Dakota.
2.) How much of a role did the Jesus controversy play in the initial mixed reviews of Revolver ? Nowadays it is widely celebrated as the Beatles greatest album but it was already in the original UK release held in high regard but not so much in the US until the 1987 standardized CD re-release. I thought the mixed reviews was due to the US release omitting 3 of Lennon's songs but was the Jesus controversy responsible as well ? Also how close did the episode really come in destroying the Beatles reputation in America or were they still musically too popular ahead of everyone else ?
