Employment law follows the location of the worker. The state the company is in does not matter for this except in rare circumstances. What state have you been working in?
NO SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS OR CONTRACTORS. I agree that during the period of my employment and for the one year period after the date my employment ends for any reason, including but not limited to voluntary termination by me or involuntary termination by Company, I will not, as an officer, director, employee, consultant, owner, partner, or in any other capacity, either directly or through others, except on behalf of Company, solicit, induce, encourage, or participate in soliciting, inducing or encouraging any person known to me to be an employee, consultant, or independent contractor of Company to terminate his or her relationship with Company, even if I did not initiate the discussion or seek out the contact.
Just to be clear, you will soon give notice to your present employer. Presumably you will continue to work for your present employer for perhaps 2 weeks. After that you will then start to work for the competitor. You will not be working for both at the same time. That is what it sounds like.
