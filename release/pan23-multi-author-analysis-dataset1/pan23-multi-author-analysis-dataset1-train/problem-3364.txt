Kristallnacht, meaning “Night of Broken Glass,” was a violent, coordinated antisemetic attack targeting Jewish-owned businesses, buildings, and synagogues that took place Nov. 9-10, 1938. Nazis shattered windows, looted stores, set fire to houses of worship, and killed more than 90 people during the night. The event is widely considered the first pogrom of the Holocaust.
How stingy does a major corporation have to be to auto-generate holiday notifications from unverified online data? I mean, I get that managing a large network of international locations is a big job and it would be nice to be efficient, but they claim to have some sort of internal review process of their auto-generated posts, so presumably they already have some sort of social media managers for each language/locale. How much more work is it really to just have them write 1-2 sentences for each holiday? I can see automating things like posting to multiple platforms, generating a list of holidays, etc., but it's not like there are thousands of national holidays in each location that they need to write for, and this is how you end up with shit like Kristallnacht promos.
KFC didn't mistakenly encourage anything. KFC planned a promotion around an anniversary that probably shouldn't be observed with fast food sales without thinking things through or they thought it through and decided the could get away with it.
