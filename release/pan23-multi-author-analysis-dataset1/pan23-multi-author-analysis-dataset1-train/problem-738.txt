Pigs are not smarter than humans, if they were they'd put two and two together over the course of generations on a farm and not be led idly to slaughter.
Very interesting. When did the population last decline due to this cycle? Something like covid killed a bunch of people but didn’t population still grow? I’m confusing myself thinking about this.
Negative. A hog is a domesticated pig, especially one over 120 pounds (54 kg) and reared for slaughter.
You may be thinking of a boar: a fierce, notoriously deadly animal which domesticated pigs can become if outside of captivity for more than two weeks.
I agree. I think it really depends on how well they work to keep populations to a controlled level and mitigate the potential for disease. There also needs to be some thought to animal quality of life. I have no issue with factory farming, I do however think animals need to at least be given room to move around a bit, good lighting and perhaps some stimulation. So this can be done, it just depends on how its done.
People are apprehensive about eating inside seasonality. Which brings its own issues in because of a 'I want it and I want it now' culture which has the vegetables people eat coming from all over the world.
One of the biggest challenges facing the world food supply is the drive to have whatever you want when you want it. There isn't really a simple solution. I'm not a vegan and there are problems even within vegetable farming that are ecologically destructive, however, globally we eat way, way too much meat and we're picky about the parts we eat.
