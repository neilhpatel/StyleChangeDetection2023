If LJ has serious _and specific_ concerns that you are an imminent danger to yourself, she can and should report that, but if she has a generalized concern that you might be suicidal without any specific reason to believe that it's imminent, and she discloses your information to others, you may have a viable complaint to to the licensing board about her mishandling of your confidentiality. If she does call emergency services, and you are visited, be calm, collected, and clearly not a danger to yourself; if you're hospitalized anyways, you will be reviewed within 72 hours at most, you can connect them with your group therapy provider if they want to know what other help you have available, and should speak to a lawyer at the first opportunity.
I suspect there are good and bad apples in any profession. My suggestion...seek another practice and therapist, if available, and try to research the person in advance.
I’m trying to say the therapist may not have been able to provide adequate therapy for the OP…either not enough experience, personal problem or something else. I see the way her care was described as unprofessional….so, if I were OP, would probably look for another more professional practice.
