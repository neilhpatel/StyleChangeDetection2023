1 - FedEx has GPS tracking in many areas of the US - you should ask FedEx for the GPS coordinates of where the package was delivered. This will tell you exactly where it was delivered - it is entirely possible that it was delivered to the wrong apartment complex or to the wrong leasing office. If the GPS data shows it was delivered anywhere other than your complex, this is an automatic win for you. Just show that data to Target and you should be good.
"(A) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker . A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this division beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing.".
Call the post office/fedex whoever was actually delviering get the coordinates of the “delivered” scan of that package and then get the coordinates of the “delivered” scans from 2-3 packages that were delivered to your house correctly. Use those coordinates for your refund claim as proof it wasn’t delivered to your house. That will get your refund I’ve done it but also file a claim with the post office over the one wrongly delivered and add that to your claim as well.
