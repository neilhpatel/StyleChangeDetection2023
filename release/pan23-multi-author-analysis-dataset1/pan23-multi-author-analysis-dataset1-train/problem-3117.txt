One of my favourite-ever lesson plans uses this strategy. It's for a course aimed at first-year undergraduate students studying modern global history, and the week in question focuses on urban history - but I think could readily be adapted for younger students as well. Urban history is a fascinating chapter in modern global history, and the class aims to get students thinking about the way in which modern cities are sites of global connections. This applies both practically and conceptually – not only are cities practically connected through migration, trade and travel, urban spaces share important similarities in how they shape their inhabitants’ lives. The basic infrastructure of modern cities – from roads to sanitation systems – are similar yet distinct across global contexts, and it’s also worth considering how far urban/rural divides matter more than national divides in the nineteenth/twentieth centuries.
I just have to say I love this idea. Art and art history bored me to death in school, and I am very instinctively philistine-y where traditional art forms are considered partly as a result. But something interactive like this would have definitely made it a much more engaging and interesting experience.
1. What is your home town best known for? Where would you take visitors in order to show them your town? What could you tell them about these places?
