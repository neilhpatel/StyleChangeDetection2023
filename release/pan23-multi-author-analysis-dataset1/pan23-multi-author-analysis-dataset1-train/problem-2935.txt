We don't control China, their country and energy grid is their responsibility. Telling Americans and Europeans to change their consumption habits so that eventually something something and then China is magically not producing a third of all greenhouse gasses doesn't really make sense, it's a more roundabout way of doing the same thing.
But you know who cares? You do u/JustMrNic3. And instead of making friends with like minded folks on Reddit, you bitch about how “Europe is the only place trying”, speaking straight out of a narcissistic playbook while neglecting the centuries of human infrastructure developed over centuries of bloodshed, so you can look at what you have and point your finger.
Look. I just want to say that many Americans care very deeply about this and vote and act in these beliefs.
Invest heavily in nuclear energy or other near non-contributing energy sources as the only acceptable power generation barring extreme outliers, heavily restrict or forbid trade with countries that fail to keep below a specified emissions limit, refuse to permit manufacturing or transport of goods in excess of that same limit, rigorously control agricultural production and force production of less climate affecting foodstuffs. Tax the everloving piss out of everyone (though primarily the most wealthy) until this shit is under control to pay for necessary infrastructure shifts. Act like a fucking government with a looming crisis.
