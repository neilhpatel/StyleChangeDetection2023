The idea of a unified Anglalond had been knocking around since at least the 7th Century, when it's first postulated by Bede. Interestingly, it's also about this time that we start to see a more concrete use of "ethno-nationalist" identifiers by English kingdoms, e.g. The Northumbrians are Anglian. There isn't one solid "identity" in Early Medieval England; the Seventh and Eighth Century Kings of Kent identified themselves not with any English or Jutish identity, but with the Cantwara, the Brythonic regional identity, while pan-Mercian identity appears to have been political rather than ethnographic. Mercian rulers typically identify as Merciorum rather than Anglorum, although this is likely due to the hegemonic/federated nature of Mercia.

Early Medieval English culture is actually very distinctive, in terms of material culture, literature, architecture. While, of course, there is cultural mixing, largely ideas adopted from Merovingian or Carolingian France, these concepts are often redefined in English formats, such as "Trewhiddle"-style metalwork strap ends. Rhineland ceramics remain a popular import throughout the period, but they are notably distinct from the proliferation of English wheel thrown styles which spread rapidly in the 10th Century. Actually, the early-mid 10th Century is a period of great cultural osmosis from Wessex to the rest of England, indicative of an increasingly homogeneous cultural identity.
This was a fantastic read. Out of curiosity, is this something you had previously written or off the cuff?
