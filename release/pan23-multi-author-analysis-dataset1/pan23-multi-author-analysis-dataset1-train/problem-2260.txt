Let me stop you right there with the "essentially free" part. My father was retired army. 20 year stint. Vietnam era vet but was never in country. He got Tricare insurance available to him of course, that he had to pay monthly for. He was also forced to get on Medicare once he was age eligible, that again he had to pay monthly for. Now was it a horrible thing? Absolutely not because those two insurances together nearly paid for damn near everything when they wouldn't fight tooth and nail over generic vs non generic or medically necessary etc. Tricare is some of the best damn insurance you can get ahold of. Another issue though? No dental, No vision. VA benefits are usually what people think about when they think free military healthcare. People need to just be more informed on saying that it is free or essentially free.
Seriously? You’re putting PLANNING ahead of people getting healthcare!? Mr Whorley, you don’t deserve to be anywhere NEAR policy making.
