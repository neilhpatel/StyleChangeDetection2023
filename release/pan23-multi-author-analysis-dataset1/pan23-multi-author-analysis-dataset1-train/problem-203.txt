it all takes time. I think because he has essentially a limitless legal budget AND is a former pres, it makes prosecuting him, successfully, very difficult. Getting these document claims, claims of privilege, forcing Trump to provide inventory of items he disputes etc, it all adds to their case. With it being this high profile the last thing they want to do is have even a remote chance he skates. Essentially, this is his pre-trial. It's either deal with these issues now, or do it later in criminal court. Either way it's going to delay things. But it also allows the DoJ to continue building their case without revealing anything to Trump or his lawyers. Once criminal charges are laid, Trump gets to see all the evidence against him, exactly what crimes he's being accused of. So long as Trump keeps this charade going in civil court, he puts himself at a disadvantage. Sure judge Cannon can rule in his favor to an extent, but as we've all seen, the 11th keeps her rulings in check. So, her favor can delay things, but isn't really going to help him if and when he gets charged criminally. But if he keeps pushing in civil court, he's going to be forced to either admit he took documents he shouldn't have, or drop the lawsuit. His best bet would be to drop it, then he gets discovery and a glimpse at what he might be up against. Right now he's fighting a losing battle in the dark while the DoJ has the upper hand.
