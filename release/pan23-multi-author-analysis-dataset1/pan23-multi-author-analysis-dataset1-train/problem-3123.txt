TikTok has been feeding me tons more information on East Palestine that is more detailed and less sensationalized or dumb as what Fox News and even the major nightly news shows. Often they just cover the horse race of it and don't get into the specifics. TikTok even once gave me a video aboit how in China most pvc is made without transporting vinyl chloride at all. Something it seems we should probably be doing.
Both sides are concerned about it, the question is the motive behind the information, you are getting information off “china is doing it better” And surely unbiased /s, republicans want to accuse delays of this without any real reason, democrats want to add regulation to prevent the issue from occurring again.
Dude just wait till you hear about how they want to ID you to watch porn. They’ll be like damn metacyan sure loves watching big black cocks. Other dude in the room will be like yo metacyan just looked up best recipes to cook before taking a big black cock.
