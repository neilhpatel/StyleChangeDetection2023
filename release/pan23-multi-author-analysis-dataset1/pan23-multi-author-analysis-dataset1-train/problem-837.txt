The whole "Spanish Empire" thing is rather confusing and mostly incorrect, since there was never such thing. Now, of course the question "what is and what is not an empire" is also complicated, and there are debates around it in almost every modern state, but the Spanish Monarchy was not, oficially, an empire.
However, and bear in mind that this is also very, very controversial, there was, according to certain scholars, something that could be called an empire during the High Middle Ages. Starting on the reign of Alfonso III of León, in the late 9th Century, some Leonese monarchs adopted the title of "Hispaniae Imperator". Some of his successors, for example, Ramiro II and III (who, as a fun fact, also called himself Basileus, that is, the title of the Emperor of Constantinople), Ordoño III or Bermudo III used this title aswell.
Thank you! That was really interesting, especially the part about how the Imperator title came to be and how it got associated so much with a single person, rather than become an institution of its own.
