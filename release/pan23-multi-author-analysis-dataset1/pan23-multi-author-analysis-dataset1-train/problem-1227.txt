Quite a lot of Washinon State landlord/tenant laws, including statewide adoption of certain limitations that are very similar to Seattle's municipal code with regard to things like rent increases and conversion of purpose.
But as others have pointed out, and the Handbook your linked to assert, the Seattle Municipal Code can and does prohibit landlords from ending your tenancy except in specific circumstances.
If you're 100% sure that you're not across the line in Shoreline or Tukwila or in unincorporated King County, then your tenancy is regulated not only by the RCW 59.18 landlord/tenant act, but also the Seattle Municipal Code and its unusually restrictive "Just Cause Eviction" statute.
To be clear: because your home is not a single-family home, your landlords may only end your tenancy for the reasons enumerated in the Just Cause Eviction Ordinance. 20, 90, 120 days... no amount of advance notice is sufficient now that you're a month-to-month tenant.
Yeah that's definitely a possibility. I'm not trying to just gouge them for money. I just need more time really as we are in process of buying our own place and so do not want to move to an intermediary place, plus lots of our money is tied up in that. I appreciate the advice and your point about being in a good negotiating position is well taken.
