You have the same rights in foster housing as you had at home - the right to food, to be free from violence, to be educated, to receive necessary medical care, to clothing and a bed, and so on. Social workers and the CPS system generally want you to go home, because keeping you in foster care is expensive, but only when it's safe for you to do so. They'll be working with your parents behind the scenes, or with law enforcement if your parents won't cooperate, and may also be reaching out to your extended family to see if there's a more suitable place for you to go in the medium term.
Yes! I’d add that I’ve seen judges approve and order the state to fund and enroll kids in some pretty cool activities like dance, horseback riding, martial arts, and general art classes. Basically, if the state has the money and it’s an activity that can be viewed as beneficial and/or therapeutic to the child, a judge can order that the social worker set up the requested activities and pay for it. GAL may even have funding.
