To return to history, this describes one of the fundamental dilemmas in comparing the Downton Abbey era with the present. In terms of absolute purchasing power, there is no question in my mind that Bill Gates is overwhelmingly richer (and has a higher income) in absolute terms than anyone alive in the 1910s. (One could use perhaps Henry Overton Wills III vs. James Dyson if you want British super-rich people. I'll stick to highly recognizable American names, the point is identical.).
Perhaps Victorian England had greater concentration but more equality (because they were all poorer relative to us) and we have less concentration but more equality (because some are wealthier than ever on history, while many others still starve).
Thank you so much for your reply! I've read it twice now, and feel like I have a more complex understanding of inequality. I'll probably discuss with my professor as well.
Absolute income inequality will almost invariably increase with increasing incomes, unless it is counteracted by very strong equalizing trends in relative incomes.
Both of the last two approaches would almost certainly say that income inequality has increased from 1973, the nadir of inequality in most developed countries. (Though one must account for all sorts of factors here, including household vs. individual income, relative price changes, demographic changes and lifecycle effects, etc.) But it is certainly not clear that inequality in 2000 is "worse" than it was in 1800, at least if you buy the argument from Lindert, Milanovic and Williamson. It certainly was a lot \different\.
