As a hint, however: if you think you can profit from the knowledge, there is a reasonable chance it would be considered material and, if that information is not fully public (not just to employees, but the actual public), its insider knowledge. As you know a merger is going to happen, while you may not (yet) be an employee of the public company, any material non-public knowledge you have of your current employer is innately also material non-public knowledge of the currently public company.
That's not what anyone is saying. There are several factual legal bases. Legally, the SEC can fine them if it finds behavior that is problematic. Legally, the SEC can delay or stop the merger if it finds behavior it thinks is problematic. Legally, the SEC can cost all of you money and jobs if there are problematic actions. These are complex, wholistic situations, not like "I was driving 81 in a 65" or rather, "I was driving 64 in a 65." Sounds fine, right? But you were pulled over for something else, and your BAC was 0.03. You can get a DUI conviction for 0.03 or you might be let to go on your merry way. Your company is saying nobody can drink one drop and drive because the risk is there, legally speaking.
