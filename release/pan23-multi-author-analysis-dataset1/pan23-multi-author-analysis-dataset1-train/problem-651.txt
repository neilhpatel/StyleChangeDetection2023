I'm not a lawyer (hence, why I came here lol) but it seems to me that they need to provide a notice of an infraction and give me 48 hours to fix it before towing (as long as it's the first infraction for that issue). Thoughts?
Unfortunately, no. There's a section above that with much more rigid requirements about signage. The property owner can either (1.) adhere to the requirements of the section with the more rigid requirements and tow immediately or (2.) just post signs at all parking lot entrances and slap notices on violating vehicles and wait 48 hours before towing.
