For the average Marine coming into the Pacific theater, their pre-conception of the enemy would be formed from the many (exaggerated) stories from combat veterans who had served in previous engagements. They would not be coming to the realization after engaging the enemy, but would already have a preconception that the Japanese would not surrender.
Captain Burden on Guadalacanal, who pioneered some of the psychological warfare tactics to persuade Japanese to surrender, discusses about \20 Japanese soldiers who gave themselves up as a result of his new topics. But he also writes that many times prisoners were shot during transport because "it was too much bother to take him in".
Interesting! You mention taking deserters prisoner, which reminded me of Letters From Iwo Jima, in which Japanese prisoners were shot by their captors, seemingly because they just didn't really care to have them around. A similar scene happens in Band of Brothers depicting the European theatre. Is this poetic license, or would that have been a common occurrence?
'Sle-Sledgehammer!" stammered the figure. I eased up on the trigger. 'It's de l'Eau, Jay de l'Eau. You got any water?" \[....\].
