This myth constructed by Labour wasn't entirely true – Martin Francis and others have argued that the interwar Conservative government was much more interventionist than previously thought – but was certainly extremely effective in appealing to an electorate extremely concerned by fears of the return of massive unemployment in 1945. Labour's message of 'Never Again' wasn't just about appeasement, then, but also very much about unemployment in particular. Rather than being about the particulars of Conservative/National Government interwar economic policy, which would be lost on most of the electorate anyway, a more simplistic myth of interwar Conservative indifference to unemployment and poverty was pushed. Churchill's role in these policies were caught up in the myths of Conservative appeasement and economic policy; and not so closely tied to his actual role in government. In this sense, Churchill's persona and history in the interwar governments certainly counted against him, and were utilised as such, but weren't usually explicitly tied to his position as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Were the impact of the interwar Conservative's economic policies, and Churchill's role in these, understood by people within the Labour party? Yes. Being argued by Labour in the run up to the 1945 election? Not quite so much.
Today, there is a pretty broad consensus that the policies of economic retrenchment and the deflationary crises caused by the return to the gold standard in the 1920s were a mistake and the cause of tremendous human misery.
