You had people in the car, and so you were responsible for their safety. Not sure who the slimy one is here.
Lawsuits in car accidents are typically limited to the amount of the policy because there's a huge difference between collecting a judgement funded by an insurance policy and collecting a judgement funded by an individual's own finances.
IANAL. First, your auto insurance will cover some liability, but you've indicated the policy maxed out. Do you have an umbrella policy? If so, that will kick in after the auto policy is exhausted. For people, like yourself, with assets or income, having an umbrella policy is essential to protect your assets and income - my policy is $5 million on top of the auto and homeowners insurance.
There may not be, I don't know every state. But the driver is responsible for the safety of the vehicle's occupants and if that means ensuring they wear a seatbelt, the driver needs to ensure that.
No, as the driver, your passengers' safety is your responsibility. If you want him to wear a seatbelt, you don't drive till it's on.
