If they’re actually a realty company, they know that they need to honor your lease. They were probably just bluffing to see if you would actually move out in 3 days.
You’re not understanding correctly. It’s standard operating procedure to deliver a 3 day notice to vacate to the property after a foreclosure. Its for the owners that defaulted on the loan and now must be evicted. They don’t know that there are renters at this time but this notice is the first thing you do after buying a property via foreclosure.
Not necessarily. The landlord would be expected to mitigate damages and try to rent out the apartment if a renter vacates early, and generally can not double dip. And it’s not exactly hard to find renters in today’s market, so most landlords should not have trouble renting out a fairly priced apartment within 3 days. If the landlord in such a situation doesn’t manage to rent it, I would suspect that the landlord isn’t acting in good faith.
No; generally the tenant would stop sending a rent check—if the landlord asked for another rent payment, the tenant could ask that the landlord state in writing that the unit is vacant.
