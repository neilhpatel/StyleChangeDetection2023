Azerbaijan is backed by Turkey and ruzzia clearly can't guarantee Armenia's security so they have to go elsewhere. They can't go to US or NATO countries because they fear angering Turkey. Turkey-West relations are complicated at the best of times, and they're extremely complicated now. So their only logical answer is China.
Armenia is strategically located and prevents Turkey from directly connecting infrastructure with Azerbaijan and the greater Turkic World (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan). Turkey has been making inroads with these countries (due to their similar languages and culture) with the ultimate goal of accessing their natural gas resources and transporting across the Caspian, through Azerbaijan, and into Turkey for processing and sale into Europe and beyond.
And maintaining Syrian operations. Russia and Turkey absolutely require agreement and relations with regards to that theater. I'm sure Syria has something to do with Russia not bombing a Turkish ally.
