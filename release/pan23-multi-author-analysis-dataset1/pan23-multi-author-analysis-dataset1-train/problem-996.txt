No need for more suffering. Being a russian is a curse on it's own, worse then being shelled or having no electricity. I'm ukrainian and spent this Thanksgiving (my family celebrates same as US instead of September) having a very nice fireplace cooked dinner under candle lights being thankful for all the fighting determination our boys have and the amazing international support we receive. I had a great time despite the russians doing their worst to make us dead or miserable like they are. Thing is, despite all their henious war crimes they will lose, they will be forced back into their beloved motherland they can't seem to want to stay in and while we will rebuild and heal they will still stay the same hateful and broken people. War veterans and all the soldiers that killed, raped and plundered on our land will most definitely not get any help from their government post war and it's unlikely they will change their ways so russia is going to be stuck with thousands of mistreated war criminals returning home to their wife's that hoped they died for a Lada or financial aid. They don't deserve our attention or resources, they are welcome to rot in their own swamp but not bringing any more of their stink here. I'm sure there will be an iron wall on the border closing them in their insane asylym for good.
The iranian drones are definitely considered non-russian. Especially because of its not standard part of the russian military. And because they are angry at iran for supplying russia, the reverse also counts if western weapons are used to strike russia proper. Same logic. If nukes weren't an issue, the US would have directly intervened and ended this war long back.
