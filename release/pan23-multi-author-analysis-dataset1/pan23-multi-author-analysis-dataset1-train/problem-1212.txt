A lot more than 1% marched 4 times in the last century alone. It’s still not over. Everyone who’s worth a damn is out or getting out. The rest can burn.
They're trying, actually. Or at least they claim they are. I don't remember seeing it anywhere here since it was minor news even in Russia, but a month or so ago, I think, I read Prigozhin claiming there are lots of volunteers in women's prisons that wish to go to the front lines to be nurses and the like. He claimed it's not being done yet, but that "he's working on it". Haven't heard anything about it since, though, so no idea.
Tiny insignificant. Cool. Please tell me, you pampered yankee fuck, how to deal with the country we were born and raised in. Sorry we refuse getting raped in jail for your entertainment. It doesn’t get better here. People die in droves and the country gets ruined only for another Lenin to come. What exactly did BLM achieve? What did you massive protests against Iraq achieve? Fuck you. I especially like how you ignore the pints you can’t counter. Typical rebel fuck.
