I feel for the families of those who died, forever more what is supposed to be a happy time is marred by the violent loss of their loved one. I hope that at the very least, they get some justice in the court.
However, Swedish style gun laws, which seem to stress the idea of "1-gun-per-person" and responsible gun ownership even in schools at young ages seems to me like something that could very easily be slotted into the US and would be a much more responsible alternative that would also help to change American gun culture from "I could kill 27 people in this mall more deader than anything that's ever died, and I'll wear a shirt that not only explicitly reminds you of that fact but also makes you feel pretty sure it might happen" to "this is my rifle. I shoot at targets sometimes and keep it at home for self defense." The most important part, however would be a full on "mental wellness" reform that makes psychopathic bullied kids and brain-rotted old hicks actually want to go to therapy.
