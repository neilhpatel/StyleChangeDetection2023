(Edited again to add... OP, you said your wife’s relative is “mentally unstable” and “was recently cut off because of psychotic and abusive behaviour.” You might consider contacting your local Magistrate’s Office to request an Emergency Custody Order for your wife’s relative. Virginia Magistrates issue ECOs if they find probable cause someone is a recent and/or imminent danger to themselves/others or may suffer harm because they are unable to care for themself. Private citizens can provide this testimony and evidence- there’s no requirement you be a mental health professional. If the Magistrate finds probable cause and issues the ECO, law enforcement take the person into custody and transport them to the local community services board for a mental health assessment. After CSB completes the mental health assessment, the person is released or taken for further psychiatric evaluation and treatment.).
I also worry that once she becomes actively aware that we're taking legal action to have our dog returned to us, she could attempt to move him to another location, have one of her trusted flying mo- I mean friends hide him, sell or give him to a third party, drop him at a random shelter somewhere or even possibly kill him to prevent us from doing so.
1. In Virginia (like many other states), pets are considered property. You can contact local law enforcement regarding the loss of yours and in an attempt to get their assistance with recovery. Depending on the value of the pet, misdemeanor or felony charges could be appropriate. Even if they don’t pursue criminal charges, a police report would be helpful documentation.
