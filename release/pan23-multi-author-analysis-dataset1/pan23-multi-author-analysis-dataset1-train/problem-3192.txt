Hello - and thank you for your question. Part of the issue with discussing civil rights films is that we have some that are ostensibly trying to reflect specific events, like Selma, and others that simply use the civil rights era as a backdrop for more personal dramas, like The Help. But they are often conflated together as 'civil rights cinema.' One of the main criticisms of the more personal dramas is that they often boil racism down to a personal issue, or the fault of racist individuals within a specific town, city, or even friendship group. By focusing on interpersonal relationships, it's possible to resolve issues much more easily than tackling institutional or structural racism, which films often ignore.
Hi. Thank you for answering questions. I’m wondering if you’ve ever looked at how the American civil rights movement influenced the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland, and if there was any idea of educating people from other countries on tactics?
Hi Dr Hunt! I'm interested as to the role of international organisations (to my knowledge UNESCO took some steps against 'racism' although I don't know how much this would overlap with civil rights as you study it) and transatlantic media companies and broadcasting organisations. What kind of role did they see themselves playing in civil rights movement, what kind of media did they produce, and were there significant moments in which their own promotion of a civil rights agenda flashed with movements within the US and UK?
Hello! This is not something I know a huge amount about, but I have never seen high-profile historians associated with civil rights cinema, to be honest. If anything, voices tend to be critical and emerge once a film is released. But from what I do know, filmmakers tend to consult historians for the more visual signs of accuracy, rather than events themselves, i.e. would there have been gaslamps at this point? What types of skirts would the women be wearing?
