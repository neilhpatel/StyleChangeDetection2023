Besides that, yeah. Though the only people I hear grumbling about the workers and this whole situation are people that for sure are out of touch rich assholes, many that hold some sort of managerial position. And ofc are usually on the older side.
Yeah, the people she's fighting against on this one are completely fucking ghoulish douchebags who don't give a shit if workers suffer and die while they enjoy their free healthcare and generous sick leave, but the reality is she's probably going to be a more effective fighter if she leaves the "completely fucking ghoulish douchebags" fact unsaid.
Lmao what? I can’t think of a single person irl or on here that thinks Biden is infallible. I mean, maybe I’m just not seeing the same posts or whatever that you are but I honestly can’t think of anyone that has never criticized or never disliked anything Biden has done. Irl everyone I know voted for Biden and non of them particularly like the guy, even myself.
