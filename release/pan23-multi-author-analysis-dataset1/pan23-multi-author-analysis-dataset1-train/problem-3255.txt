Fun fact, hocul pretty much sabotaged the democratic party in the house by ending up with a right wing gerrymander and being a unpopular POS causing NY to have 4 seats flip, imagine how long this would go on if the senate was 218-217 instead of 222-212, technically that 1 vote present earlier would have put the speakership in democratic hands but it probably wouldn't have happened if it determined the speakership.
Hard to give up when you’re so close to some power. 3rd in line in country, he thinks it’s his turn. He’s 1 vote short. Problem is he gave up all his power to get it. They can call a vote to get rid of him at any time, that’s what he conceded.
