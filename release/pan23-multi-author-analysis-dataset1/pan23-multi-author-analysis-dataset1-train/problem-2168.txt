Anyway: on the other end of things (subject wise and geographically), much of Russia is new, like incredibly new. The Russian Empire as such only got its name in 1721, and the expansion of Russia outside of its European core really got started in the 16th and 17th centuries, and much of that settlement and control dates to the 19th centuries. Meaning that in many ways Russia has more in common with, say, Canada or the United States in its colonial newness than with China or a European country. Boston, Montreal and New York are older cities than St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk or Vladivostok (heck, the part of Russia Vladivostok is in has been Russian for less time than California has been part of the United States).
About ethnical and cultural diversity. I'm not so sure about it either. Of course, different regions have different problems, and there are some cultural differences, but mostly Russia is Russia. In other words, difference between Moscow and Voronezh and Moscow and Kazan is much bigger than between Voronezh and Kazan (Moscow is very rich, and smaller cities are not). Even the language is mostly the same (it's really hard to comprehend for Russians how different could be American regional accents, because Far-East Russians speak the same language as their Moscow comrades â€” there is a very light pronunciation difference, so light, it's even hard to describe).
