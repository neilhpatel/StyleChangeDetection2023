It's a legal problem for the company that the paychecks didn't go through: the idea of cutting employees an additional check to tide them over is them making a good faith effort to live up to their obligations.
In Florida, it would be legal for them to withhold pay from future paychecks when there has been an overpayment (as would be the case here once the direct deposit clears, if employees also cash their checks).
Ok thanks! I don't think double pay is what anyone is after, I just want to know what possible issues could arise from taking a paycheck but having to 'pay back' the employer in either cash or a personal check, since that is what the employer is suggesting.
Not a lawyer. I would be worried that a lot of people would treat “when the direct deposit goes through” as when the balance of the DD appears in the bank account, which may not may not be the point the employee has been double paid if the employer is on the edge of having no money (the usual problem when payroll slips). Checks take a surprisingly long time to finally clear even if the balance has appeared, so I would not even contemplate paying the employer back for a month after both are done personally.
