Although Zhukov didn't comment too extensively in his memoirs and public comments on his Western counterparts, he was mostly praising, but that is to be expected perhaps, seeing as they were obviously very carefully crafted to avoid offense in most cases. That isn't to say he was silent though! In regards to Montgomery, he called him "Skillful, agile, and smart in a soldierly way" although it should be noted Monty apparently annoyed Zhukov in their first meeting by trying to compare El Alamein favorably to Stalingrad, which Zhukov thought absurd.
Thanks for the quick response! Itâ€™s interesting how even though the Cold War was raging friends on both sides of the curtain still managed to connect.
Exactly! He felt threatened by Zhukov because he knew that Zhukov had a lot of standing. Strictly speaking, he was wrong to suspect Zhukov was actually going to do anything as there is no reason to believe that, but on the flip side, it isn't a coincidence that Zhukov was rehabilitated by Brezhnev who wanted to bask in the reflected glow of a war hero, yet was sure to keep him politically neutered. I've written on this in more depth .
