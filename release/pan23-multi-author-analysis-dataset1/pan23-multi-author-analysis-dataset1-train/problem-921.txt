You can’t really get the notices “off.” Factually, they were issued. It just comes down to how your current landlord answers the question (leaves blank, answers no because they believe the notices were given in error (highly unlikely); answers yes (truthfully).
If the 3-days ever do come up with a future landlord (and there is a very good chance they won’t), make sure to stay factual and unemotional. Don’t say that the manager had it out for you, even if that’s true. Explain the facts for each case: 1) you submitted paperwork for your ESA, but didn’t realize it was incomplete; once notified you submitted additional paperwork 2) you had a guest that visited frequently and the manager mistakenly thought you were subletting; even though the guest maintained their own home and were not living there, you asked the guest to come over less frequently.
I know! I didn’t put in the post, but I’m under a lease for a couple more months or I would have already left. That’s what I thought, which is why I’m thinking fighting to get them off might be a good idea.
