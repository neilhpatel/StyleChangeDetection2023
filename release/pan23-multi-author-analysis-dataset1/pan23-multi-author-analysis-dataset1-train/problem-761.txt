At some point, the general consensus among them became that he's not competent, and keeps making mistakes.... If we kill him, and the guy behind him takes over... we'll be screwed, as he won't make such obvious (possibly drug fueled) mistakes. So they stopped trying. I believe I was first introduced to the information via the history channel, but I can't remember the program name. This is just what I could quickly find online.
Canada was the 4th largest contributor in the European theatre I think though I wouldn't have called us a superpower, I've heard historians consider France to be one at the time, they got crushed early in the war but the free french never stopped fighting got to do the Undertaker sit up at the end too once it was liberated.
And then what? Fuck Putin, but I do not see a good ending. Russia is so deep into its own Rus nationalism I cannot see how this can end in a good way. Putin's main critics are basically criticising him for not being even more brutal. There is no real opposition in Russia. A lot of people talk Navalny but his coalition is basically only united by "fuck Putin" and completely irrelevant.
