The main reason why Hispanic & Latinos don’t like this word is because it doesn’t make sense when speaking Spanish. The “X” sound is very unnatural when speaking Spanish. We only make that sound in the beginning of words like “Examinar”, “Exponer”, or “Exigir.” But “Latinx” is not pronounceable for a lot of Spanish speakers. In addition, many Hispanic & Latino people considered the word to be another form of white imperialism/colonialism. Even though we speak the colonizers language itself, aka Spanish, we made it our own by including our indigenous people’s words. And while Spanish should absolutely find a way to be more inclusive with gender neutral terms, forcing a group of people to suddenly all identify as Latinx comes off as problematic. Especially when that group of people telling us to use that word don’t even speak Spanish, and don’t understand that it is a gendered language.
Absolutely. I'm just trying to understand your thinking as you could be right or see something I've missed.
