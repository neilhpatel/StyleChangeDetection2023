Part B) A court may not appoint anyone to make a law (redistricting). Find the law unconstitutional or in violation of another law and send it back to the legislature.
Please give me the section of the constitution (federal or state) that gives courts this authority? Doesn't exist in the Federal Constitution. If state lawmakers put it in their state constitution, then by all means they have the authority. otherwise the court can do jack shit other than say the redistricting law is unconstitutional and can't go into effect.
Part A) State courts have a constitutional duty to see if the law (redistricting) violates the state constitution or other state laws. Federal Courts have a constitutional duty to see if the law (redistricting) violates the Federal Constitution.
100% right to not have any faith that SCOTUS will do the right thing. It's all about power and the money that comes from having it.
