What do you mean when you say that he did not list her or her children on there? What do you mean by there?
Other than that of what I understand of the scenario my grandmother did speak to them but they basically told her that since the brother owns it but died, that means we have to go work it out with his kids since the brother was the one who signed all the documents and she was allowed no say in that matter.
b.	The cemetery people will not communicate with anyone except your grandmother. She could should write them a letter and tell them that she is the lawful widow and was married to the grandfather when he died and that she now, by law by Texas law, owns his plot. They could ask for evidence that she was married to Grandfather at the time of his death and she would have to somehow provide him them with that kind of evidence.
Therefore, if your grandmother contacts the cemetery people, gives them evidence that she was married to your Grandfather, tells them that she never gave power or permission to the uncle to sign anything on her behalf.
It is possible that the cemetery people were not told the truth and did not know that your grandmother even existed or that your uncle had authority to sign for her on her own behalf.
Did the cemetery people tell you then he signed an affidavit of some kind naming himself as your grandfathers heir?
Did the cemetery people acknowledge or admit to you that your Grandfather owned the plot before he died?
Do you believe your Grandfather and or your grandmother owned the cemetery plot before grandfather died?
Do you think believe that the uncle named himself as the owner of the plot as the relative of your Grandfather?
If that is the case, then it doesn't matter what the uncle signed because your grandmother could be probably is the current legal owner.
