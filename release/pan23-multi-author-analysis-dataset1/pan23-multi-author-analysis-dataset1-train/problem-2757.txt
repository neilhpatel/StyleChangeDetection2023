Yeah I'm Russian (although living abroad) and always found it crazy how so many still see Putin as "patriotic". He's literally been doing everything to destroy Russia (just within the limits to still keep his chair). It's almost like he's been acting like a f-king Chinese spy, if you ask me.
The largest holders of US Treasury bonds are things like Social Security, which use them as an actual investment for future disbursement not an oroboros of magic numbers to bury any sense of real-world value in reams of paper so that the ruble only freefalls at a potentially survivable rate instead of being absolutely 100% worthless.
No. Russia defaulted. People don't seem to understand what that means. That mean much of the western financial companies cannot buy bonds at all based on the ramifications of that. Add sanctions on that along with illiquid market. Now other countries like China and India may not have issues with a country in default I don't know. But 11 months ago Russia was not in default if I recall, now it is and that changes everything vis a vis the western financial markets. This is the thing that is going to damage ruin their economy for a long time to come is that default. There is no just "fixing" it and things are back to normal, not how it works.
