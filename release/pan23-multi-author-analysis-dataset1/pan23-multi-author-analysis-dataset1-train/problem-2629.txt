That is a question that may deserve its own post (espionage/assassination being so different from battlefields), but I think that you may find interesting Japanese traditions about Tomoe Gozen, who is said to have fought in the Genpei War (1180–1185) as part of the army loyal to Minamoto no Yoshinaka. The Japanese historical fiction epic Heike Monogatari describes her as follows: "Tomoe was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.".
However, its not specifically a movie trope - the word trope of female ninjas was popularised by the series of books known as the Ninpōchō series (忍法帖シリーズ) by Yamada Futaro (山田 風太郎) 1959-2001. This series depicts a number of fictional conflicts set in the Edo era, and features ninjas as we know them from fiction, using hidden weapons and seducing their enemies. Both the trope and the word kunoichi itself were popularised by the influence of the Ninpōchō series, which is the first known use of the word kunoichi to refer to female ninjas specifically.
In the Edo era (1603-1867), the word くノ一 (kunoichi) did not even mean female ninja - it was used as a rare alternative way to refer to women (女) in general. The meaning comes from the strokes in the character 女 (woman) - when handwritten in Japanese it is drawn with the 3 strokes くノ一, which when written separately can be read "kunoichi". So at the time period discussed, the word simply meant "woman".
