This is rarely relevant. You are being prosecuted by the State for the benefit of all its citizens, this isn't about the alleged victim. What is the maximum possible sentence? Your post is far too vague (and maybe that's necessary) to give more information. You don't even list what country it's in. And judges in many places rule on conflicts.
Second, I don't know where you got it in your head that in DV court in Wisconsin the worst penalty for "fairly serious criminal charges" -- which, based on the recommendation made, are almost certainly either felonies or habitual criminality misdemeanors -- would be probation or a deferred prosecution agreement, but speaking as a Wisconsin criminal defense lawyer who has done a TON of DV cases over the last decade, whoever gave you that information is flat out wrong. I don't need to know what county you're in to say that, frankly; the class of charges that could be prosecuted with domestic violence surcharges AND face prison liability were never going to be DPAs and they almost certainly involve jail time. To suggest that you could walk with no real punishment is unrealistic.
