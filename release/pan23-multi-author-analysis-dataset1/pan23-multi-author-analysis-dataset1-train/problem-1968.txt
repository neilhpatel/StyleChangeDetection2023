Good afternoon and welcome to the “Racism Is So Universal, It's Become Normal: Race, Representation, and Accuracy in Works of Popular Media” conference panel Q&A! This panel examines how accurately popular media engages with race in historical settings.
You know what I mean? I can't help but feel that the people accepting that framing of the "numerical argument" cannot escape that line of questioning--it's beyond race and racism, and says something about the way the broader public conceives of history and historical truth, prioritizing that kind of quantifiable "fact". We have to say something, right?
This presentation is aimed to analyze the representation of the Chōsokabe clan, rulers of Shikoku island, considered one of the most influential clans of the middle years of this period, in the video game Nobunaga’s Ambition: Sphere of Influence developed by the Japanese company Koei in 2013, a game that has been praised for its historical accuracy in the international market. Following an iconographic–iconological methodology, I will examine its historical events, scenes unlocked by the player which include content that is considered “historical” by the game’s developers. Specifically, we will study those between the one-hundred-and-ninety-fourth and two hundred, as well as a few isolated scenes of special relevance, which reflect the vision of the video game on the exploits of the Chōsokabe clan to determine if this case study perpetuates to the world an idealized view of medieval Japan.
Thanks again for a great panel! Do you think there are good methods that movies and pop media can use to help teach good, accurate history while also keeping the 'drama' they want?
For both panelist, how do you think developers could strike a right balance between the 'drama' needed by pop media, and accuracy of the material? What about good ways of doing it in a respectable manner?
