I have money stored away in several private accounts, my own IRA. I have just given money to him to put into the stocks to keep it growing just in case. It makes more in his account with thousands than mine with hundreds and he gives me a percent of the dividends to put in my accounts unless I say otherwise. I have chosen to withdraw the money invested in the light of this newfound idiocy and plan to store it away with the rest of my emergency funds. Either way, bad decision or not, I came here to ask about if we were legally obligated to let his mother seize control of his inherited funds. I have made my decision that if she would like to talk to anyone about it that she best talk to an attorney because there is no way she is just going to come to my house and start acting like she owns our entire lives.
Oh. OK, so they are all accounts that gma put him down as the one to get when she passed? Like life insurance, bank accounts, retirement and stuff? No physical things like a house or car?
