Isn't it a weird coincidence that Russia claims they inflicted a large casualty event on Ukrainian soldiers that nobody has verified right after Ukraine pulled off a devastating strike against a Russian barracks killing a large number of soldiers that even Russia admitted it happened?
Formal declarations in the past are just words. Words in Russia are super easy to reverse once the will is there.
Coincidence? They are all powerful and all knowing and the only reason Russia hasn’t dominated Ukraine is that this is just a special operation so they can’t send their fearless leader shirtless into battle riding on top of a bear to single-handedly crush all opposition and neither Ukraine nor anyone else can so much as scratch Russia unless Russian soldiers are disobeying Putins orders by smoking in unauthorized areas or using cell phones without permission. /s.
This isn’t for external consumption, it’s entirely for a domestic audience. The Russian public exists in a world where they’re not at war, yet simultaneously fighting against the collective weight of NATO. They’re winning the (not) war, but need to mobilize hundreds of thousands. The West is weak, yet an existential threat. Ukrainians are brothers, yet infested with nazis.
