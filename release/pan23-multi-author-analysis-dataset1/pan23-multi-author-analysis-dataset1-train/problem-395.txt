by Goya (1746-1828) is a complex, problematic piece of art - problematic largely because of issues around its identification and interpretation. The short answer to your question is that no one can be sure if the myth about Saturn devouring his infant offspring actually inspired the painting.
Oh, absolutely! As far as I can tell, no Goya scholars suspect that anything crucial was lost (the main criticisms seem to be the quality of the restoration), and we know it wasn't a case of a title being painted over/destroyed or anything as explicit as that. It's just a smaller interesting element of Brugada's process of attribution/identification to consider, since he didn't leave extensive notes in his inventory.
Thank you! So, to reiterate, there is (obviously) no information from Goya himself, but the primary connection with the myth of Saturn is that there is a large, older figure devouring a smaller, younger/naked one, but the manner of the devouring, or other elements of the painting don't strictly point towards the myth, correct?
Great question! "The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there," as the novelist Leslie P. Hartley tells us (1953). That said, we can't pin this entirely on differences in cultures or differences in the past. The fact is, folklore often works with its own logic that would seem bizarre if transposed into the real world. Often the characters act in ways that seem nonsensical.
