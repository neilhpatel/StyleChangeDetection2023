The Nation of Islam’s (NOI) version of Islamic history differs quite dramatically from most historians' or popular understandings of Islamic history. NOI understood Islam to be the original religion of humanity from the beginning of time 66 trillion years ago and original humans to be Black. According to NOI’s understanding, Black people had brought Islam to the Middle East, not the other way around.
The charge that Islam was an import to Africa did show up among Nation of Islam’s (NOI) critics. Kwame Ture (at the time known as Stokely Carmichael) of the Black Panthers charged that “Islam is not an African religion,” and argued Islamic expansion was linked to the slave trade. NOI members rebutted this in different ways. The most common way was to argue on the basis of NOI’s cosmology that Islam actually predated Muhammad and was connected with the creation of the Black people.
Thanks! I've always found coptic sects in Africa(and the Jewish population in Ethiopia, as well) extremely interesting as far as their origination as a somewhat isolated denomination of Christianity(and Judaism respectively) and how that separation from the religious epicenters altered their interpretations of similar script and practice.
