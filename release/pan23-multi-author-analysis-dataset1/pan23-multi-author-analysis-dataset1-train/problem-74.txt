I'm not a med mal guy but if someone came into my office with your story I would definitely be seeing dollar signs from the potential referral fee alone. Chest pain is a common symptom but potentially a very serious, life-threatening one. Medical staff is absolutely supposed to run certain protocols before discharging you after hearing the symptoms you described. It's impossible to say based solely on the facts you've provided thus far exactly how strong your case is, but I can assure you that an attorney would certainly be interested in looking into it. The most difficult part in the case would perhaps be proving and defining damages, i.e. that the delay in treatment caused additional injury which would not have occurred otherwise. Again, I'm not a med mal attorney, so take that for what it's worth. But definitely do your homework and find a good med mal guy when you're ready.
Definitely contact a malpractice attorney. Also, I'm seconding filing a complaint with the state medical board. To me, and I am not a lawyer, based off what you've said you're in lawyer territory. I don't want to get into conjecture beyond that - thats what your lawyer should do.
