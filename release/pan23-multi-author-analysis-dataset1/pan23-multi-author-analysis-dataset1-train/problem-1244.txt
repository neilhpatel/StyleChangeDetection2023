In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Expensive? Yes. Though in this situation dangling a large juicy carrot is far better than hitting people with a big stick. That comes when the amnesty ends and all of those firearms are definitely illegal.

I'm a very good shot. I used to be part of a Junior Olympic marksmanship team. On my wall, I have 12 medals from sectionals, and two State bronze medals. The sport taught me patience and discipline. I still go to the range regularly, as it's fun and relaxing.
