This is a good question, and I think the first one is to sort out what we are talking about when we say "Buddhism". The territory of Shapur's empire stretched to the Indus river, and included the territory annexed from the Kushan kingdom. Now, the Kushans seem to have practiced a syncretic form of Buddhism that mixed influences from Hellenic, Iranian, Indian and even Mesopotamian religion. Buddhism, which has a long tradition of syncretism, as practiced generally differs a lot from the more philosophical "textbook Buddhism" most people are familiar with.
Thanks for the answer! I guess a lot of it boils down to subjective interpretation, but do we know, or can we infer, whether the Persians viewed Manichaeism as principally a Christian sect with some Zoroastrian elements, or as a Zoroastrian sect with Christian elements, or neither? Based on Bahram's hardline approach, he seems to have treated it similarly to how less accommodating Sassanid rulers treated heresies, but it seems that Mani thought of himself as neither a Zoroastrian nor a Christian but rather the founder of a new movement that superseded both.
