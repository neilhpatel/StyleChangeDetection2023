You know why Paludan, a "Danish politician" burned it in Sweden? Because he couldn't get any support in Denmark at all, didn't make it anywhere, and was silenced by apathy, because most people simply didn't care about him, despite the media really trying to make stories about him.
I agree. Though the action in of itself didn't do anything but make people upset at him, and for some reason, Sweden. The whole point of this was to cause discourse, probably.
If Turkey continues on its current trajectory, Finland and Sweden will be integrated into collective defence through alternate, complementary arrangements, bypassing Turkey. This will only weaken Turkey's position.
Even with double citizenships he’s still obviously predominantly Danish. In the article it also says that he got the citizenship specifically to not be denied entry into Sweden when burning the Quran, so it’s not something he’s been all along. Not that this really matters as Danish and Swedish people are pretty similar and there’s more or equally racist people than Paludan in every country on earth.
