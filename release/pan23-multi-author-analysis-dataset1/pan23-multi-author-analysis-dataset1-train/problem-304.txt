I remember listening to an episode of hardcore history several years back. It was about the initial invasion of France.
Russia was actually really peaceful overall. Most conflicts they participated in were either small-scale or blitzkriegs, where a small portion of army elites entered and exited. Most Russian soldiers are conscripts and never saw a battle or even thought of one. As such, nobody invested any mental or physical resources in training or solid maintenance, doing only the bare minimum.
You are wrong. My sources in Russia say that anyone who wanted to dodge mobilisation or even flee the country was successful in doing so. Those that were drafted did not try to hide or dodge it, just accepted their fate. Which is a fate of a soldiers of a failing invasion force.
Do not underestimate your opponent capabilities. Russia still have a lot of older tech, and a lot of people. It had enormous advantage at the start of the war, and while it diminished with losses, russian army still enjoying strong 2-5x numerical advantage (in tech) over Ukraine.
