There are a couple issues with this potential causation, though it does ring true in the immediate sense. It relies entirely on how drivers currently act. It's not so much the bicycles as the reduction of awareness from those driving cars when the cycling population drops. (Does increase until the latter is dealt with, but the counterproductive argument assumes we pass helmet laws and nothing else.).
This is frequently not true because the safety improvements for cyclists is way overbalanced by a big decrease in cycling (canâ€™t get a helmet for bike share or store your own easily at a restaurant, cafe, bar, or store) so it results in an increase in car trips and thus car crashes.
Okay. Some things to note. First off, the article argues a general decline in biking among children, but children up to middle school here already have to wear school-issued helmets when they bike to to school, and elementary school students are not allowed to bike to school at all. They walk. This law isn't going to affect younger children, because they are not the target for it.
