If we do a simple estimate of the Notitia Dignitatum, an incomplete registrar of units that for the Eastern half dates to and was updated over the course of 398-405 AD, we'll find that the military strenh of the empire in the Balkans numbered about 71,232 Comitatenses and 46,400 Limitanei along the Danube from the border of Noricum up to Novae (Shvishtov) in Moesia Secunda, plus the Limitanei in Scythia Minor. Granted, this is on paper, but unit strenhs in the East were fairly high, and we know the Notitia Dignitatum is extremely accurate for the East (despite the missing sections) due to studies of extensive documentary evidence from late antique Egypt.
Wouldn't this have been an issue for the Huns too? Were the late antiquity Romans particularly bad at coordinating their armies, or were their enemies particlarly good at it?
Fun(?) Fact: Aetius' use of "Hun bucellarii" is probably heavily blown out of proportion. The primary source evidence seems to make it clear most of the cavalry he recruited into the army was Alan (and Roman, obviously), and his own bodyguard was a mix of Romans, Goths, Alans, and possibly some Huns. In 433 Aetius wasn't given an army of Huns by Rua to regain his position with; it seems to have only been a threat of an army of Huns.
