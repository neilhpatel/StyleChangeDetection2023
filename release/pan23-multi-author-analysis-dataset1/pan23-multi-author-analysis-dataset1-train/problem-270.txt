As to the democracy question, Cuba is one of the most democratic nations to ever exist. The Cuban people have input not just on political concerns but economic ones as well. "But it's a one party state!" You might say. Well in Cuba you cannot run as a member of the Communist Party of Cuba or any other organization. To get elected you must convince the people to vote for you for your policies not your affiliations. It is illegal to run unopposed and every six months the representative must return to their constituents for a mandatory no-confidence vote this ensures that there is always a choice of candidates and that whoever is elected is held accountable.
Man... that's garbage. Cuba is how it is because of the US. We deal with other far worse undemocratic regimes every day. Our largest trading partner is just that.
All the same people that like to scream at the top of their lungs about how bad America is are the same people that walk around wearing hammer and sickle shirts or hats, crap with Che Guevara’s face, and will champion the ideas of karl Marx and Lenin, but always say when confronted with the atrocities of those leaders that it wasn’t “real” communism. They push the idea that they could have done it better. Yet they fail to realize they would have just gotten a bullet in their back just as quick if they didn’t follow the status quo.
