I probably wouldn’t do anything until talking to a lawyer/DOL but you could summarize what’s happened in an email and say something like I just want to be clear on what you’re expecting of me and also want to remind you that my FMLA leave doesn’t expire until the end of the month. If you’re willing to go back after your leave is up then it’s probably helpful to offer to discuss a plan for you to return then. If they confirm that they’re asking you to come back before your leave is up or you’re fired then you should definitely get a lawyer or at least file a complaint. I believe DOL or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would be the right place.
Appreciate it. I havent been able to get anything in writting, but I've been getting heavily pressured/harrassed since May and documenting conversations. Any recommendations?
Not a lawyer. It does not sound like they are firing you it sounds like you are not willing to adhere to the requirements for work. Absent a contract or a union I don’t believe there is much you can do.
Again not a lawyer but I don’t believe this situation would allow you to quit and get unemployment.
