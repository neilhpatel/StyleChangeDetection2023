The difference is they have everything to lose on the defense and nothing to lose on the offense. This translates into doubt in the cause which results in no morale. On defense though losing means everyone you love losing and regardless of wether or not your politicians are right or wrong your national pride comes out resulting in the ability to pull off crazy shit. This isnâ€™t even factoring in geographic advantage/ disadvantage from defense offense.
Ha. Thanks. Is that an auto correct thing? Seems like I see it all the time now. I refuse to accept that there's that many people who don't know the difference between lose and loose.
Unprecedented battlefield casualties? Unprecedented since when? i am not a historian but there are orders of magnitude to catch up to WW1, Russian Civil war and of course WW2.
Seriously. People keep repeating stuff about the population being increasingly critical of the war and conveniently leave out that they are mad about not having won yet, while they still think the invasion is absolutely justified.
