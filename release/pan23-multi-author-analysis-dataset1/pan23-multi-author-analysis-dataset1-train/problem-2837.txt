You should read up. He was instrumental in attempting to breach US government systems. “Distribute malware” is the simplified explanation for what he did, which was attempted to crack hashed password values to gain deeper admin access to US systems via Manning to STEAL documents and material.
I think his cult of personality is weird. And the false effort to conflate criticism of Assange with "America can do no wrong" is bad-faith argument.
Assange did not "expose the misdeeds of the United States." He conspired with disgruntled federal employees—Bradley Manning apparently acted out of spite because he hated the Army and his colonel father—to indiscriminately dumb massive amounts of extraordinarily sensitive national security materials. The vast majority of these exposed no "misdeeds." None exposed an evil conspiracy. The vast majority were intelligence cables and other information that could allow authoritarian governments (yes, Venezuela and China) to identify and punish or kill sources. Other materials were "merely" sensitive diplomatic cables. The worst Manning revealed, as I understand it, was a botched raid that killed civilians. That's a horror of war. It does not justify releasing national secrets en masse.
