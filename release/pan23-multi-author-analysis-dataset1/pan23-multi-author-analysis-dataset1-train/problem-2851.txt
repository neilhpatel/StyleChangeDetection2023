I did indeed discuss the roots of modern popular music elsewhere, including . It’s funny, media depictions of music in the 18th and 19th centuries are dominated by the classical tradition, in the same way that it’s now a cliche that ‘All Along The Watchtower’ is the music behind footage of Americans in Vietnam in late sixties (even though it was only a smallish hit at the time and servicemen during the era predominantly listened to regular pop music). I imagine it’s half because the upper classes are very well-represented in media focusing on those times, which plays a role in leading to the impression that this was the music of the era, rather than a music with connotations of specific milieu. I also think that folk music doesn’t connote era quite as specifically as classical music in such media, what with it being meant to be timeless (as problematic as that assumption actually is).
