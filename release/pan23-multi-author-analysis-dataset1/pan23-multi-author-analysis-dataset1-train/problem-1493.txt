Orwell's 1984 has unfortunately been memed to death over the past few years (intentionally, in my opinion), but the concepts introduced in that book are scarily accurate.

It targets, exploits, and splinters human emotions in such a way that the capacity for logical thought is essentially erased and it has the potential to cause people to commit unfathomable atrocities while still believing themselves to be entirely in the right. The sooner people are able to understand this reality, the sooner the true nature of the global right will become readily apparent, which will ideally make it easier to combat their insidious and destructive ideology.
