I will be honest, I did not realize I needed them. It was a new environment and it never crossed my mind initially. I did have a standardized schedule right from the beginning however. Accommodations can change as time goes by and eventually I realized I needed a better communication system. After this realization I communicated the new requests/accommodations with my research mentor and the graduate school. For 6 months (before the oral exam) I kept following up with both of them. One month after the oral exam (the 7 month mark), I was let go.
Again I'll reiterate, you can definitely consult with an attorney familiar with this type of civil litigation and with the disability department and see what can be done, but ultimately it is probably a good idea to just move onto a new lab and be more selective to ensure your PI and you have a good understanding and will work well together.
How am I supposed to move on though? He will eventually get tenure and a diversity supplement grant money that has me named in it for my disability. I know I will have to move on but at what cost? Someone gets job security after discrimination and keeps federal money designed for me? I don’t have an outcome currently because I don’t know the future. I don’t view time the same as you do.
