Bear in mind that the new Congress (118th) started work (sic) on Jan 23, 2023. They're STILL futzing about with committee assignments.

“Antisemitism” is an interesting criticism. The GOP attack against Rep. Omar trivializes antisemitism and antisemitic remarks. Claiming that a country is too dependent on US military aid is hardly a commentary on their religious beliefs, practices, or validity. She didn’t call for Israel’s destruction, after all. She pointed out that US military support and political cover (courtesy of the GOP) allows Israel to do some pretty heinous things against Arabs who are predominantly Muslim. If any fair criticism of Israel’s policies is “antisemitism”, than are we to sanction attacks on the Jewish citizens who live in Israel who rightly bring up those same criticisms? I think not.
