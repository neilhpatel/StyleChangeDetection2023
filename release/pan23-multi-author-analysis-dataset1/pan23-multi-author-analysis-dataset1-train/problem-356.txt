Vital Stats in Florida has a lot of leeway in what they accept for acceptable documents. The key is actually getting a hold of someone to talk to there.
editted\\\ Damn I did not know but do you have anyone that can order it for you using this "applicant is not one of the above, the application must be accompanied with a notarized Affidavit to Release a Birth Certificate (DH Form 1958) signed by one of the above, along with any supporting documentation and a copy of valid photo ID of both the person authorizing release and the applicant.".
I don't know if this would work but you could look into having a grandparent assigned guardianship and they may be able to request one but the sad truth of the matter is you may be required to buss to Miami and deal with some things in person, and you'll most likely need a family member.
OP should actually do this right away. One (maybe one of the primary) services homeless shelters offer is helping people get documents like State ID's so they can qualify for desperately needed state/federal benefits.
I dealt with this same issue from 15 to 20. No ID, other than a social security card. They would not give me one without a state identification, or I would need to go physically to the location with an immediate relative (mother, father).
