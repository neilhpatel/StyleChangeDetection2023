Maybe, but I doubt it. I know it's a bit insensitive to say but his "delay" reminded me of someone with mental disabilities not a shrewd politician. I currently work in a number of those "circles" you mentioned and, from my experience, the sort of "actor" you're referring to usually gives me the creeps. At the time I was just a 20 year old newbie but there was nothing even mildly intimidating about W even as he grew angry with me. I grilled him about the damage he did to the Texas school system and I don't think he even realized I was pressing him until about halfway through the meeting. When he did he scrunched up his face a bit in anger and he finished the interview like a kid being lectured. At the time his biggest crimes, in my eyes, were making a really bad decision on schools and imitating a Texan. Both bad but neither necessarily nefarious. So, after the interview I felt bad for grilling him. I apologized and tried to explain that I was just doing my job. He immediately smiled and forgave me. Then he buddied up to me and started trying desperately to impress me. Not exactly the actions of a wolf. Of course that could still be an act but if it was W should be making movies with Meryl Streep.
