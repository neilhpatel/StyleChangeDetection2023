Also, it would be a good idea to report this crooked realtor to the National Association of Realtors and any state/county regulatory department that may be applicable in your area.
You don't have to fight. Just tell them you haven't been properly notified of the termination of your tenancy and you're not doing them any favors by leaving voluntarily until they compensate you for illegally intruding on your tenancy.
I did. The police came and did have them removedâ€¦ but now I cannot go back and use it to shower etc which my kids and I needed to be able to do until Saturday while our hot water tank is finished being installed. They breached my privacy and tried to move in. Not exactly somewhere i want to go now to parade my family around naked to shower. So they essentially robbed me of my legally given 30 days to vacate. Who knows who all has access to the house now. Their mail has been coming there for 3 days, and now their cars are sitting outside. All they did was remove the uhaul.
Their choice then would be to give you that 30 day notice or go to court and try to evict you after the 20th, and after weeks/months a judge would hear that and I think would likely say the notice to terminate the tenancy was ineffective and would deny the eviction. And then they could start over by giving you a proper thirty day notice.
