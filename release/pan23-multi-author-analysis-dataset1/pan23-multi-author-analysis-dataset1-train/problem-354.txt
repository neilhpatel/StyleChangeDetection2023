"Take care of legal matters regarding it" is not the same as them representing you. In general, this attorney would be obligated to do one of two things here; either make it clear that they represent the company and not you to give you a chance to get your own lawyer, or explain to you the representing you both is a conflict of interest and getting your consent (usually in writing) to proceed with the representation despite the conflict.
Thank you. I gather from all the posts here that the deposition isn't something that I should avoid to protect myself. I'll work with the attorney to make sure I don't trip myself up during the process.
I'll talk to the attorney about the conflict. I'm mostly sure he is representing both me and the company. I had talked to an independent attorney two years ago and they said the company would provide representation because I was working for them at the time.
The way it was explained to me is that since I was working for my company at the time of the collision, they would take care of the legal matters regarding it. Also, the papers I have state me and the company as the defendant. Specifically, it reads "\[My Name\], individually; \[Company Name\].".
