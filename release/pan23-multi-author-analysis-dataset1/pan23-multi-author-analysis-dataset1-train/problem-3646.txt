Okay what you’re reading is obviously biased history to feed the Indians because thats the reality. Before there was no empire in the subcontinent. It was divided into princely states and each was ruled by a nawab or prince at the time. No unified empire existed in the subcontinent before the coming of Mughals. Babur after defeating Ibrahim lodhi in panipat started the conquest of subcontinent and brought the whole subcontinent under one empire the Mughal empire.
You are right though. Do people really think the workers of China are empowered and own the means of production? That the exploitation of the working class has ceased and the government ensures a common ownership of property? Ted Cruz is more Marxist than Xi.
The whole India/Russia/China triad is a weird political relationship. Russia and China are seemingly buddy buddy. Russia and India seemingly are too. India and China on the other hand….
Extremely ignorant comment. The Mughals were not even the first muslim empire. Northern India and present day Pakistan were under muslim rule for over 300 years before Babur.
