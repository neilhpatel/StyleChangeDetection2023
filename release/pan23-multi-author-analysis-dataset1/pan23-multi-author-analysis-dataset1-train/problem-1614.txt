I'd probably go talk to the neighbor - as nicely as I could - and ask for a copy of their survey, because sometimes there can be conflicting information that leads to conflicting results. Say you want to be able to have your surveyor compare the two before you both spend a bunch of money on lawyers. And I'd be clear that is where this is going, but do it in a matter of fact manner. "We disagree, and I'm not going to argue with you, I'm going to let a judge decide.".
In the alternative, you can get your lawyer to serve him with a letter with a deadline to respond, stating he needs to remove the fence because it's on your property and even submit an offer that you would assist by partially paying to remove the fence. This will make you look fair and reasonable. After two attempts to negotiate with him you can file an application in small claims court and submit your evidence to the judge and ask for a judge's order to remove the fence. If the court sides with you, ask for costs from the plaintiff as you tried to keep the matter out of court by negotiating with the plaintiff, but you were forced to bring this matter to court because they did not want to negotiate in good faith. Most of the time you will get your legal costs back if you demonstrate to the judge that you were reasonable and you did everything to settle the matter outside of court.
