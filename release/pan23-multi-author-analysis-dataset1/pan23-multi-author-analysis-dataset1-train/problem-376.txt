Ugh So two more days on not understanding why you cannot access your money? The more I think about it, the best I can come up with is that they got a garnishment in abstentia, but that doesn't make a lot of sense if you see a July court date. A garnishment in abstentia would mean that the Court believed that the debt collector had properly served you notice of the court hearing and "defaulted" you. Default judgments can usually be set aside and in this case no notice is an absolute violation of due process. Doubly confusing is that debt collectors usually cannot collect on debts because they aren't the original owner (there is no privity of contract) let alone if you never owed a debt to anyone Another alternative is that the bank just royally screwed up and put a garnishment on your account when maybe they were only served some kind of notice of a lawsuit?
Thank you! They said that I would have to speak to the legal department because they don’t have any further information. Legal isn’t open until Monday. I checked my banks messages, documents, etc. and there is nothing.
I work in a credit union, typically our department that processes garnishments (not called collections, but essentially is our collections department) will be able to provide our members with information on the garnishment and contact information for the party garnishing you. Not sure if your financial institution is the same but that may be a good place to start.
