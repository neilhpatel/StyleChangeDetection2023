I don‚Äôt think Russia‚Äôs actions on Kuril Island are going to lead to a nuclear war but I do start worrying when idiots (not you, but ppl like u/AgentTrashPanda) start yammering about starting a 3 front-war with Russia which actually would lead to them using their nuclear weapons.
Lol. Right at the start of all this, like first half of March iirc, japan was quietly bustling around putting a nice clear "dis ours" official seal on the kurils. They just didn't call press conferences about it.
Absolutely. I have no doubt they have plans on how they would invade New Zealand, if nothing more than as a thought exercise etc. But the current anti-Russia fervour is payday for cretins like Newsweek and Daily Mail.
Not necessarily. There were plans drawn up but that's what any competent military does (not that they actually are one). America, for example, has plans for how to invade literally every country on Earth. Not out of maliciousness, but strategically, it's better to have some sort of plan to work from if you need one. Never know when an ally might get invaded and you need to save them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
