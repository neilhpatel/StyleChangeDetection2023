NAL but from all my boredom fueled research on the topic of the dark web it’s unlikely that much will come of reporting it. You still should report it and use the link posted by others but due to the nature of the dark web and TOR it’s incredibly hard to track these sites down which is why they still exist despite the dark web being known of by a lot of people. For all that I’ve read about the topic unless the feds or other law enforcement get lucky or the site owner makes a mistake it’s very hard to catch these people since any illegal site like these will likely either be heavily encrypted or in countries where the government doesn’t care like North Korea.
Report it for sure. However, There is verifiable evidence that some of those sites are actually traps (honeypots) set by International law enforcement (FBI, Interpol, Europol, DHS/ICE) to catch the offenders who upload/download the content. As others have stated, it takes no time at all to report it, and I would add, please be very careful on the dark web.
