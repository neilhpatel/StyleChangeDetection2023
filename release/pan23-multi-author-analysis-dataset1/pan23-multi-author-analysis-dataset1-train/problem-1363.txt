This guy is a POS. I hate that enough of Virginia was stupid enough to vote for him. The Dems also completely failed by putting up McAuliffe. I had to hold my nose to vote for him.
Fallacy. Globalism merely lowers the price by allowing labor markets to seek least cost. And that's assuming the cost savings are past on and not kept as profits. If the market will pay more, you don't charge less just to keep margins low. Global trade existed before "globalism". Globalism is more about global supply chains than global supply of finished goods.
I was gonna make a mostly joking comment about how I’ve done Mormon pioneer reenactment treks through Wyoming, and that I’ve driven west to east, and south to north in Wyoming and wasn’t really impressed by the endless sage brush… but then I remembered Yellowstone, The Grand Tetons, and The Devils Tower and many more amazing parks were also all in Wyoming.
Not really. Your talking labor cost, but you also reduce operational cost. It cost more to ship from China than it does from coast to coast. And labor is not the entire cost of most products, in fact, it's a small percentage on most products. Increasing labor cost by 2x isn't going to increase prices 2x. All our efforts in tech are to reduce labor cost already. It's why people don't import cars, because the increased labor in the US is offset by the increased shipping cost from overseas. If you want a Honda, you buy one made in Ohio, not SE Asia.
