2) Many leases require official contact addresses. (Quick Google search says yours does too) Send a certified letter with signature to that address mentioning your conversation to change rent and requesting to confirm current rent price. Receipt of letter carries legal weight and landlord has the responsibility to respond. (Edit: Send a rent check too... If it is cashed, you found a way to pay).
Yep, if OP is actually worried about being somehow implicated as participating, they could do a documented inquiry/report to the attorney general’s office (or whoever it is you would do this with) asking if the landlords are using their info to collect covid funds, that rent money is set aside to pay rent, they’ve tried to pay rent, but the landlord is being non-responsive.
This is most likely the case. We have 9 properties and 3 of our tenants asked to not pay rent even though they were all working or receiving the same SSI benefits as usual. What they were asking us to do constitutes fraud against the Federal government. Uh, no thanks!
Part of me wonders if they went dark on you because they are cashing in on more lucrative landlord assistance programs (“my tenants would pay me this much rent, but the government program covers a higher amount so let’s pretend these people aren’t paying.”). The reason I say this that if they never, ever responded, maybe something happened to them. But they asked for the ID of the new tenant and that makes me think maybe they need the ID to claim the assistance.
