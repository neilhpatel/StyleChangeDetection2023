If the Dems just run hard with it, the Republicans would shoot themselves in the foot. Make it a prominent ad. Buy Fox News ad time. “Kevin McCarthy wants to prevent America from paying back what he spent. This will cause…”.
But hey, good going with the hyper focus on numbers to avoid the bigger point that the shifting of the tax burden from the übermegawealthy to the middle and working class has dire consequences, the people pushing us into this sham default crisis damn well know it, and are prioritizing the short-term gains for their wealthy donors and themselves over the long term wellbeing of the American people.
I would be fine. If there is no more reputable journal I’ll self publish or just vlog on it. Thanks for worrying about me though.
I will never understand why middle and working class people are so eager to line up behind those who consistently cut taxes on the very rich and load the responsibility onto middle and working class families instead. The Trump tax cut for the rich upped my family’s yearly taxes from about $6000 to $25,000 last year. Fuck yeah there’s a class war but guess who is waging it? Hint: it’s not the working and middle class.
