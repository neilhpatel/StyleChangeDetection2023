Early colonization of Europeans in Oregon was something of a contest between Catholics and Protestants. Which isn't much of a surprise since in the 1840s Oregon was under dual occupation by both the British and the Americans.
But back to the 19th century, Oregon was attempting a kind of statehood. As the Civil War crept closer, attention started to shift less from religion than to race. Samuel R. Thurston, the Oregon territorial delegate to congress, pushed for the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850, which made this explicit by granting land to whites based on race instead of religion or national origin. This brought in these pesky Irish Catholics, French Canadians, and Catholic members of the Hudson Bay Companies. This wasn't done because everybody put their old hatred of each other base don religion aside—it was to achieve the minimum 60,000 non-Native people needed to apply for American statehood.
Thanks for sharing! You mention the minimum of 60.000 non-Native inhabitants to attain American statehood—could you point me to any sources that discuss this policy and its effects on different states in more detail?
