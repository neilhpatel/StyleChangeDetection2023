Previous answers have focused more on the difference between breeds, an important part of the answer to your question, but they do not relate to horse training.
The short answer is yes, in all likelihood military horses would have ride-able by anyone with some skill, and being a member of the cavalry would have required skill. Unfortunately, there is a lack of material on horsemanship from this era, and thus it is impossible to answer definitively how horses were trained, what commands were used, and if they were the same across different cultures.
Unfortunately I was unable to find much on the Islamic side relating to cavalry training other than general information, but the linkage to Greece/Europe and the fact that while the horses would have been a different breed, a horse is a horse and at the end of the day there are only so many ways to skin a cat.
Depends a bit on what you mean and which time period. If it's for riding to a battle yes but if it is for fighting a battle during the crusades the answer is no because the "West" and the Arabs had a different approach to horse-breeding and their use.
The Arabian horse on the other hand was one of the best breeds at the time and was widely sought after in Europe but their way of breeding, feeding and training the animals are widely different.
