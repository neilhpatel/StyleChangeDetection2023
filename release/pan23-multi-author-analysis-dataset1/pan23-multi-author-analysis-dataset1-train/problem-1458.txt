I have heard speculation that the West had a higher proportion of sex between men because those who wanted to escape pressure to marry and those who felt they weren't "fitting in" in some way may have seen the West as a better option - far away from families and societal pressures. Unfortunately, verifying that statistically would be very difficult.
Going back to my knowledge of Victorian London, there were 2 famous areas for gay sex work. Soldiers were barracked by Horseguard's Parade/ St James Park (by Buckingham Palace) and this area was where it was known that soldiers would sneak out to make extra money. This possibly could have more parallels with the Gladiator situation in terms of being available to the rich - and again I don't see too much of a parallel with the West as it was developing. In summary, desirable masculine soldiers available for rich men.
so interesting! thanks for the answer. to be honest I'm quite surprised, given that female sex workers were so common, and that article I linked above about how common it was for men to have sex with men.
