Satou also played a key role in identifying the "hypothetical enemy" which would serve as the yardstick against which the Navy's needs would be measured, but unlike other nations who chose their hypothetical enemies based on diplomatic disposition or threat -- think Britain and Germany's naval arms race -- he advocated for choosing a potential enemy based on their capability to harm Japan, whether they indicated they had any intention of doing so or not.
However, note the location of the Philippines on this map. They sit directly between Japan and her new Southern Resource Area, and posed a major threat to the Japanese supply lines. At this point the islands were owned by America, and they had several major Army, Army Air Corps, and Navy bases in the area. If for any reason the US entered the war, they could shut down the Japanese supply lines in a moment, which is exactly what happened when the US took the islands in 1944-1945.
As an aside, the United Stated knew that, if Japan attacked, they would start the war with a surprise attack, likely on the Philippines. Therefore, the surface forces in the Asiatic Fleet were all old and expendable (one heavy cruiser, one old light cruiser, 13 old destroyers, and several auxiliaries and minor combatants), though the submarine forces were extremely strong (29 submarines, including 23 of the most modern in service). When the various war warnings came out in the weeks before, most of the surface ships were moved south and out of harm's way, but the submarines continued operating out of the Manila area until the Japanese were just outside the city, and even after that made several supply runs to Corregidor.
Thanks very much! Means a lot since I've seen the standards you all keep around here. I've answered a couple questions in the past few weeks after lurking for a long time, so maybe if I get a couple more meaty ones I will apply for a flair.
