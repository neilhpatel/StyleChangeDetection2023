Also consider what happens if you do nothing. If the wall fails suddenly as a result of a monsoon, it was not as structurally sound as it appeared and causes damage to the neighbors home or yard. They file an insurance claim under their property insurance, their insurance co sues you. Your liability insurance would come in here. Your insurance is going to check on who owns the wall, who put the wall in initially. You recently had a mason inspect and they didn't recommend replacing the wall, it is likely your insurance co would not pay out, you were not negligent, your neighbor is out their deductible. But if the insurance co said you were negligent, your insurance would pay out and the neighbor would get the deductible back. Double check liability coverage before deciding not to do anything, some policies will only cover damage to structures if you are negligent, not damage to land, you could be personally liable in some cases.
NAL. I was curious so I tried Googling and on the first page it literally said both the lower property owner was responsible as well as whoever's property it sits upon is responsible. Therefore, I would seek the advice from someone at the city level for the specific rules in your location as to who exactly it falls on to maintain the wall.
