The old guard (like McConnell) certainly know. Unfortunately, there’s a whole generation born during/after the Reagan years that have no idea that it’s a lie. They grew up with a party that told them that Trickle Down Economics is the best, education is terrible, and the only thing you can believe is FoxNews. Marjorie: The Gathering, Sarah Palin, Matt Gaetz, Madison Cawthorn, etc, are all examples of people who are not particularly aware that the thing(s) they’re pushing for are lies. (Hence, why they’ve also become tough to control when they follow Trump rather than the GoP leadership.).
The psychopath devastated multiple generations. Reagan’s drug war was nothing more than a modern day Tulsa Race Massacre.
Literally. The GOP default position is "I got mine, fuck everyone else"... Often even when they don't have theirs and helping others would help them too.
Literally. When uninformed people complain about politics and the bullshit we see and government not working, I think we need to point out they are talking about Republican and their policies.
