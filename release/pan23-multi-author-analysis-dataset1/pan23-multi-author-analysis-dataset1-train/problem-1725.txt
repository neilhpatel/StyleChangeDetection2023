Trawling through for any other remarks he offered turned up nothing further. There are a few interesting connections, such as Charles Lippincott, who was the publicist for Star Wars, and was the publicist for Hitchcock's Family Plot, his final film, in 1976 when he first began working with Lucas & Co. , he at least makes no mention of sharing his next project with Hitchcock, so there is nothing to suggest more than mere coincidence and no further connection.
100% accurate. As I tell any of my students, the key isn't knowing everything. The key is knowing how to find the thing you're looking for. Take a library as an example: three people go into the library, looking for a particular dictionary, let's say Collins, 1987.
Person C goes to the catalogue, opens the advanced search, and inputs all the data available, under relevant headings "Publisher: Collins; Year: 1987; Keyword: dictionary". They get the precise code, and only one result on the catalogue. They get the dictionary minutes after getting the library, their main delay being bumping into a salesman (pop up ad).
