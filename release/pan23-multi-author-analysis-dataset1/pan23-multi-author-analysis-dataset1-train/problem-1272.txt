It's not abundantly clear from OP's narrative that anyone owes anyone else anything, but it's a possibility. Being in a common-law relationship in Ontario is more about the facts of the relationship and living arrangements, and less about choice like it is in the USA.
This is happening in Ontario, where common-law relationships work slightly differently than in the USA. You can find yourself in a common-law relationship somewhat easier in Ontario than you could in the USA, and partner support (e.g., alimony) is absolutely a possibility if you are in a conjugal relationship and living together for at least 3 years (plus other factors).
OK, wait. She moved out, and you're not married, and she wants a settlement after months. She's bluffing. I don't see any legal precedent here at all for her to be owed anything. Did you abuse her emotionally? Why did she move out in the first place? Even if you did, she'd need some evidence. Call a lawyer. She could be charged with extortion or blackmail if you are innocent of these charges.
