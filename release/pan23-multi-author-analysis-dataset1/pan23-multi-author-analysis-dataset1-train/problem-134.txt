What do you mean? There's tons of studies and data showing that younger generations are more educated, more informed, and less likely to believe conspiracy theories. I'm just giving my conjecture for the causes.

What I mean is that you seemingly believe that there is no possible attempt from billionaires to influence or control the spread of information on the internet (or possibly in academia) in the exact same manner as they did with television, and your “evidence” is a cheap summation of Republican economics as “tax cuts for the rich” not working and a specific criticism of Fox News as if it is the only purveyor of misinformation in cable news.
Bad wording on my part. I mean to say that the elected officials are moving hard right (no exceptions on abortion bans, book burning, attacking teachers, "woke", "CRT", RINOs, separating kids from parents with zero intention to reunite them, etc.). They are moving right of even their own base - they take some with them but they are appealing to the extremists. Elected officials are going beyond conservative - going authoritarian and regressive - while their most conservative voters are dying off. That tension will snap eventually.
