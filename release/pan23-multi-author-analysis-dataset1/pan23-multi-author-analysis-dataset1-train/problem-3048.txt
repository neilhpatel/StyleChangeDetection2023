Without a prenup, it is hard to say whether you would be entitled to it or not. Depends on all your other assets. Not contributing anything toward the properties does not entirely mean you are not entitled to any of the money. What matters is the grander scheme of your assets as a couple and how much of the total assets the rental income encompasses. For instance if, at the time of divorce, the rental income was somehow like 70% of your combined total assets, it would be more equitable for you to get some of that money. Assuming that is not the case, and the rental income is substantially less than that example, you not getting any of that money is probably an equitable result.
So that really depends on a lot of circumstances, particularly because you are in an equitable distribution state. The division of assets depends on how much money you both earn, whether you held out on potential increases in salary due to the marriage (like held off on going to school to support him and stuff like that), how much you will walk away with compared to him, etc.
Okay, thanks. Right now the rentals make up about 2% of his income so it’s basically negligible. I think there should be something in there that covers the case of the rental income becoming his main income. My fear is if he sells the rental properties and buys us a house with that $. Then, our house is technically only his. And if we get divorced, I’m not entitled to that bc I signed my right to it away. Or is property purchased during a marriage always considered marital?
