On the fiction side, travel between the Earth and other heavenly bodies has been the source of myths and stories for hundreds of years. But works prior to the late 19th century were more fantasy than science fiction. In 1856, Reuss wrote Hviezdoveda or Å½ivotopis Krutohlava in which a man journeyed to the moon via a balloon and returned in a dragon-like machine to explore the rest of the solar system. Just a decade later Jules Verne, who wrote From the Earth to the Moon, is the earliest popular science fiction author who recognized some of the life support challenges when departing the Earth's atmosphere -- his fictional engineers must deal with removing carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used.
TLDR. In early modern literature, to get to Sci FI, we went from Utopia to dystopia. Sci-fi is a mirror of our times - and through exiting the here and now, both in time and space, it can draw societies as they might emerge and discuss our ideals and issues today. Whether these are positive or negative projections doesn't matter in the end. Thats why early examples of Sci Fi Literature, there is no heavy aspect laid on the scientific or technical side. Just like today, a good book should tell a compelling story and thats what these "Sci-Fi"Books cared for; explaning what could be possible.
