This might be a bit late, but I’ve been reading a bit about the recent killing of Azerbaijani crime boss Nadir Salifov and I’m fascinated by the Soviet/post-Soviet criminal underworld and the network of воры в законе. For example, I still can’t wrap my head around how Russian vegetable markets can be so profitable as to be the object of bloody mafia feuds. Does anyone have reading suggestions on this topic in English or Russian? Thanks!
Religion, politics and warfare (particularly the relationships clerical leaders had with political and military leaders).
Any recommended books on Marquis de Lafayette? I just read The Marquis: Lafayette Reconsidered but came away underwhelmed with its depth. Made a bit more sense when I realized the author was an art historian-- she seemed much more interested in random portraits and possessions than relationships. At one point it effectively time jumps forward 15 years, skipping the Napoleonic Wars and cursorily glossing over the death of Lafayette's wife.
