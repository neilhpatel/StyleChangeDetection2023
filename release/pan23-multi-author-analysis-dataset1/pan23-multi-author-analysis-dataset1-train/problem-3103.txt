To be fair, unlike contemporary villages, most medieval villages tended to be clustered more closely together so you would have definitely known many more people than those living in your particular village and though it would be possible to meet a complete unknown (perhaps someone moving in or passing through from one of the more distant neighboring villages with which you are not that familiar) but would have been, again, unlikely.
So, the answer to your question is... it's hard to tell. The theological concern was there, and many tried to adress it. The practical problems were there too, and they were even valid by today's standards (what stops someone from duping someone else into marriage and then forget that ever took place? How can you prove consent is real when you abducted the girl, maybe even threatening?), but eventually the formula of marriage was a mixture of both worlds: consent of the families and witnesses was expected, even enforced sometimes, but marriage was indisoluble and it was a religious affair, for the most part.
Duby presents the picture of two ideas of marriage, one, inherited from Roman law by the Franks, the Anglo-Saxons, the Lombards, the Visigoths and other successors, where marriage was a social contract requiring of witnesses and paternal approval, but where divorce was also a freely available option (and in high Frankish society, polygamy was also a thing). The other idea of marriage was the Christian one, where marriage was not a contract, but a sacrament, and as such it was indissoluble, and only administrable by a priest.
