I'm 41 yrs old. Russia's nukes have been hovering over my head my entire life and I'm fucking sick and tired of it. I'm at a point where I feel like fuck it all, let's go mfer. Let's just all send it and see who and what is left. I don't mind dying if it means they all die too. Crazy right? But that's what 40 years of threats does to a psyche. And don't get me started on NKs threats, wish we would just nuke them into oblivion too. (I don't REALLY feel this way, it's just.....damn). I get the other side feels exactly the same as I do too.
Admittedly doesn’t count for Purchasing power parity and Russia hasn’t used its full military (non nuclear) capability mostly because of NATO and keeping up a military defensive capability on its borders..
Hints? Either you use it or you don’t. It ensures mutually assured destruction, so I doubt Putin is really serious about using a nuke against a NATO country.
