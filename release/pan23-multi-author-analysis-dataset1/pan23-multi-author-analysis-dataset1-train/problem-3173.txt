In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I agree with that. In fact, it's irritating that the future of American democracy might be decided by independents who vote for DeSantis because they not only agree with his beliefs, but the difference being that they like him.
No shit! The GOP doesn't get it's their rhetoric and policies they champion that are the problem, Trump was a symptom. Rather than reassess they are going to double down on a more extreme candidate yet. Even if they have to remove more rights, enact martial law and beat it into us, they will force us to admit they are right all while destroying the environment as a happy byproduct.
