Because freeing slaves was \[edit\] actually illegal impractical to the point of near-impossibility \[end edit\] under Virginia law, she issued informal papers of manumission to enslaved people "belonging" to her family, and arranged for them to conduct their own affairs and control their own finances in Richmond. One of these individuals, Mary Jane Richards (aka "Mary Bowser") became one of the most useful Union spies during the war, even infiltrating Jefferson Davis' residence while disguised as a laundress. Van Lew ran probably the most successful intelligence operations during the war, providing consistently useful and occasionally crucial information to General Grant and others, to the point that Grant appointed her postmaster of Richmond after the city fell. She disdained the term "spy," but there is no doubt she would have been in grave danger of being hanged as such if she had been discovered by the Confederate government.
How common was manumission before this discouragement/prohibition became widespread? Famously George Washinon emancipated all his slaves at his death. Additionally it seems as though the founders wanted to imitate at least the aesthetics of the Romans (the Senate and all that) and manumission was seen as virtuous in the Roman Republic to my best knowledge. Was there ever a period when it was seen similarly either in the colonial or early United States?
Florida actually did make manumission illegal. South Carolina required the approval of the legislature before a slave was granted emancipation, something that they usually were not likely to do. This was why I tried to preface the response with "it was complicated" between 1831 and 1865, because there was some variation by State. But regionally speaking, I think it would be a fair interpretation to say that manumission was broadly discouraged.
