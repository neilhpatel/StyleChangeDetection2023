I’ll address what I picked up as the subtext of your post in a way the article maybe didn’t make clear, though. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party stonewalling against the neoliberals because they don’t do things the “right way” is a non-starter. We need to be fighting the surging fascism that is the modern Republican Party, not each other, which means until those fascist elements fade into obscurity and we can slide the Overton window back to the realm of sanity we’re going to have to compromise with each other. What you may have missed in the article is that Katherine Clark, a leader of the progressive caucus, was elected as the Minority Whip leg of the House Democratic leadership triumvirate. That position doesn’t get the press that Speaker of the House does, but having worked with Steny Hoyer, the outgoing party whip, and watched him collect votes, it carries huge weight in influence.
