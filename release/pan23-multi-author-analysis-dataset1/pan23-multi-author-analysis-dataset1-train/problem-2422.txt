In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Great. We'll have a really good record of all the crimes he got away with. I guess I was mistaken. I thought you got arrested when you commit a crime.

Pretty fucking idiotic when a man with criminal exposure can enjoy immunity from prosecution simply by virtue of a DOJ policy against charging a sitting president, and then when that person is a private citizen again all they have to do is say, “Hey, can’t touch me; running for office,” and the greatest law enforcement body in the world once again sits on its hands out of some cautious posture of “muh appearing political.”.
Get the popcorn ready! THE Trump indictment ( The one where Merrick Garland will make the announcement) will land within 30 days. He will be booked, photographed and after court appearance collection of his “multiple “ passports and the negotiated settlement on where he will be allowed to traverse ( only New York and Florida- flight risk concerns), he will be released. It’s all about the workings of the criminal justice system. Racketeering is a BIG deal in America- In many ways, Trump is no different than Al Capone. My over/ under is he’ll do 24 months soft/ hard time- nine months to a year of lock up and the rest tagged and permitted to be housed at either Florida or New York, not both.
