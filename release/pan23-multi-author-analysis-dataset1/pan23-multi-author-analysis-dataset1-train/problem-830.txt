Another prominent figure that could contribute but has less of a direct lineage is Moses, being depicted as performing miracles by the raising of his staff. This would have grown in prominence as the Christianization of Europe commenced, but if Simek's claims are correct that Odin was already being shown with his staff in the 1st century then it's more likely that Moses' staff-wielding did not have as direct an impact on views of magic.
My pleasure! You're totally right about Graves, though I'm always surprised how often his ideas (or ideas like his) sneak into academic discourse. As for the relationship between Lleu and Gronw, there's certainly something interesting going on there, but I'm not sure it maps clearly onto seasonality. There's no indication in the text of when Lleu's entrapment or Gronw's death occurs, nor of the space of time between these two events. There's also no clear seasonal imagery related to either character (a lot of the ideas about what Lleu "represents" rest on an also-problematic association of him with the Irish Lugh LÃ¡mfada... who in turn is a lot more complex than he's often made out to be.) Blodeuedd is made of spring flowers, so she's presumably created in that season; she becomes an owl, which do mate in the winter; but in both cases, her status as a being created and transformed by Gwydion may be at least as salient as any temporal resonances. Frazer and Campbell are in many ways as tricky as Graves, if not more so; their universalist approaches often obscure as much as, if not more than, they illuminate.
