This is a very twisted interpretation. The camps were set up and organized by the RSHA (Reichssicherheitshauptamt = Reich Security Main Office) which was directed by Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, Gestapo and Minister of Internal Affairs (Head of Police) after '35. The SS ran the camps, and as such the SS was not part of the army. So, German regular soldiers (of those drafted into the regular army, the Wehrmacht), did generally not serve in the camps for this pure logistical reason -- it was not the army's prerogative.
Oh interesting. So it sounds like there were a fair number of Germans that worked the camps, and those that didnâ€™t work in the camps probably had larger driving factors than psychological reasons. Thanks for the reply!
The administration and operation of the camp system was the responsibility of the Concentration Camps Inspectorate (Inspektion der Konzentrationslager, or IKL) from 1934-42, and of the consolidated SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (SS-Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt, or SS-WVHA) from 1942 onwards. Among other responsibilities, SS-WVHA was the organisation responsible for the selling of slave labour from the concentration camps to private industry, and the seizure and disposal of prisoners' personal property.
Oh I loved learning about the Trawnikis. It sounds like they did play a large role in running the most brutal parts of the operations despite being outsiders.
