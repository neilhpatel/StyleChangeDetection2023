Most big corporations have ESG policies. Partly because it is required in some territories, such as the EU, which is in response to societal demands, and partly because there is increasing demand from shareholders.
ESG is a farce. Companies only care about short-term financial goals. My company supported the Trump administration in further wrecking immigration, helping them with making their evil immigration regulations. The same company pretends to value diversity inside the company while actively supporting national rules that thwart diversity. My company helped the Trump administration separate families at ths border. But to a person, the management thinks they are so woke and wonderful. My company management, the gate keepers, as I call them, cashed in their morals to make more bucks, even when it meant ripping children from their parents. What won't they do for a buck?
Itâ€™s amazing that the EPA and various environmental laws and regulations originated with Republican President Nixon.
