Incidentally, "man-at-arms" is often used to mean "common soldier" but this is anachronistic. In the example of the 18 knights and men-at-arms cited above the men-at-arms would have been of lower social status than the knights but not by much and would probably have come from the gentry, albeit maybe younger sons or cadet branches, unless they were common soldiers who had worked their way up. Men-at-arms (g'endarmes in French) were gentlemen entitled to bear arms, which means both that they had the means to equip themselves with full armour and at least a couple of horses plus one or two servants (varlets) to look after the horses and equipment ("gros varlets" would fight and have weapons of their own, and resemble what you might have had in mind as a "man-at-arms"); but they could also "bear arms" in the sense of being entitled to display heraldic arms ie what tends now to be called a "coat of arms".
Thank you for finding the time to write such an informative answer. May I ask what share of the ransom a normal soldier might expect to receive? Or what other promotions etc?
This answer is mostly drawn from the primary source collection translated and edited by Anne Curry in The Battle of Agincourt: Sources and Interpretations, but if you'd prefer a straightforward history of the Agincourt campaign, I'd suggest Anne Curry's Agincourt: A New History and Juliet Barker's Agincourt.
