Unfortunately, the bar for animal neglect of livestock is pretty high, and things that casual observers think are neglect or abuse are sometimes not. In order to make an effective complaint to animal control, you need to provide info which is factual and specific. For horses, a Henneke body score of 3 or less (you can look this up for pictures); for all hoofed animals, cracked or split hoofs, "elf shoes" which means the hoof ends are curling up and the pasterns/fetlocks are dropped; for sheep, unshorn to the point of heavy mats interfering with movement, pooping and nursing babies; for chickens, multiple dead carcasses left for an extended period, remaining animals are cannibalizing carcasses; for all animals, no food or access to grazing, no water or foul water, both over a period of several days, confined in stalls/small areas which are uniformly piled with manure such that the animals are fetlock deep and cannot stand on firm ground; eating manure or soiled hay persistently.
Thank you! Its mainly her goats- they all have split hooves and there are always several limping around. She feeds them expired foods (in plastic wrappers) that she gets out of the grocery store trash. The goats are cooped up in a small area filled with trash and feces- zero grazing land. That is why they love my nice green yard .
