Johnson, with his rough, non-aristocratic style was in stark contrast to the smooth, polished Kennedys, and many in the Kennedy administration were outright cruel to him, including calling him the nickname, cornpone behind his back. As time went on, Johnson pinned much of the blame on this on RFK.
I think in terms of Boston in the 20th century I would phrase it more in terms of that they were an upper class in the Irish Catholic community, and the Kennedys made strides to make themselves generally acceptable to the Yankee upper class, which was a different ethno-religious community that traditionally was antagonistic towards Irish Catholics.
I find this very interesting! In this analysis, because your conception of class is tied to social standing and culture (which is in turn tied to complicated intersections of race, religion, and ethnicity), the Kennedys could be described as upper class in an analysis of the country at large, but were not upper class in the specific context of the NE/Boston elite?
Kind of. You're definitely correct in the sense that they were wealthy, and especially for say JFK this wealth managed to smooth his way into otherwise very Yankee/non-Catholic spaces like Choate and Harvard.
Even by Anglo Protestant Yankee standards, the Kennedys had a fair amount of crossover appeal in terms of manners and upbringing (studying at Harvard instead of Boston College, for instance).
While ethnic/religious divisions in Boston were very real (the Kennedy's were never Yankees in the New England sense of the word), they were definitely upper class Irish Catholics, the term being "lace curtain Irish". Among Irish Catholics in Boston at the time there were some pretty stark class differences, and a James Michael Curley the Kennedys were not.
