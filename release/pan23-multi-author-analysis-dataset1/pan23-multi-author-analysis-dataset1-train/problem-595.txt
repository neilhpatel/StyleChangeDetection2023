The core Republican leadership could have (and I imagine wish they did) jettison those whining assholes so many times over the years. Hell, several of them are implicated in the January 6th insurrection attempt so it's not like Republican leadership would have to look far for a valid reason when, in reality, it's because they have no real policy doctrine except grifting wherever/whenever possible and do not have the best interest of the GOP at heart. But here we are, years later, watching McCarthy do the song and dance to keep them happy. It's both hilarious and depressing in how pathetic they all are.

Republicans are anti-democratic. That goes for the party leadership, it’s politicians, and (increasingly) its voter base. This is a fork in the road for the county. Do we stomp down anti-democratic (I’d argue, fascist) policies championed by Republicans and their base? Or do we let it continue to fester and erode the foundations of the country?
