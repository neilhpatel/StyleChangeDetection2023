Private companies are making decisions for the vast majority of their customers and their employees that they choose not to do business with those who refuse not only a vaccine but a simple test. They are entitled to do so. Those who refuse a vaccine or test are entitled to stay home where they can't put anyone else in danger.
Anyone who claims this is the reason they aren't vaccinated is full of shit, anyway. They aren't vaccinated because they don't want to be vaccinated. Because they've decided they know science better than scientists, because YouTube conspiracy theorists are more credible than PhD virologists and epidemiologists, or because their political leanings are more important to them than their health or the health of those around them.
Have you asked them for a refund? But it would be negligent of them to allow entry to people who can't test negative or show proof of vaccination. Allowing infected people entry into a concert is not in the public interest. And as the other poster commented, their tickets have a novel of fine print that likely covers these sorts of things generally.
