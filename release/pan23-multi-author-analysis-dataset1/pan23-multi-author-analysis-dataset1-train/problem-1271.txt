But in some of these countries collaboration has been systematic - meaning that the government was encouraging it or facilitating it. Polish government in 1939 and earlier (as holocaust started in 1933) was never encouraging it or faciliating it unlike some other european countries. I live 3 km from Majdanek concentration camp, I can see the watchman towers and mausoleum from bus window when I pass it by since I was a little kid . My grandpa was playing with children who died in that camp. I walk through the park where once were jewish homes. Imagine living next to the whole society that has been destroyed. I still wonder how would by neighbourhood look like if WW2 never happened. Anyways how many collaborators there have to be for the full society to be evil?1%? 5%? 20%? Can u give me the number? There has always been people with the consience and without one as long as the world goes. And it has nothing to do with nationality. I heard that the war or other borderline situation.
The history of polish nazi-collaborators is being consistently downplayed in the entirety of polish society. People aren't taught about it in school nor in university - and actually.
