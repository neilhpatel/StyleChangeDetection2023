We see a very different solution to the widespread traditional belief in giants: while many people have traditions about extraordinarily large human-like entities, these is the repeated problem of explaining why we haven't encountered them since they should be easy to see. In this case, a common solution is to relegate them to a distant time or place: "There used to be giants, but they lived long ago," or "there are giants, but they live far away [in Wales or Cornwall for the English; or in Finland or eastern Russia - depending on where the bearer of tradition lives].".
Follow up question: From my (limited) understanding, ancient Mayan (and Olmec) people burned clearings in the forest, and ancient Scandinavians often lived along the coast (outside of densely forested regions). I also know that, historically, in rural parts of the Congo, Bantus cleared forested areas to build settlements as well, and from my understanding, traditionally believed spirits inhabited the forests on their peripheries. But, at least in the Congo (and parts of southeast Asia), within those peripheral, densely forested reigions, hunter gatherer groups existed and developed pygmyism over time from living in the dense forests. Is it possible (obviously going pretty far back into prehistory) that within these dense forests on the periphery of ancient Mayan and Scandinavian worlds there were forest dwelling hunter gatherer groups who may have developed pygmyism over time?
