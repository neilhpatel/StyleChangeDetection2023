Using that made me very curious about the history of tack, bridles and bits. Lots of bits I've seen look very, very harsh compared to what we use today, so it made me think maybe they were only used on horses that needed more pressure, ("old Bess doesn't need a metal bit, this leatger bit, or no bit is more than enough to control the sweet old girl... But demon over there..." ).

I know I've seen leather bits in pictures but of course I can't find them now. I know metal bits show up in the 1300s? (I think).
Before I jump into my full explanation, I’d like to note that when I use the terms “modern equitation,” “modern horsemanship,” or “modern tack,” I’m taking a deliberately broad view of what constitutes “modern.” The foundations of modern horsemanship -- ways of riding that would be immediately recognizable to a 21st century equestrian -- were cemented in the 16th century and had developed into their distinct forms by the mid to late 19th century. In short, my use of “modern” encompasses a rider from 1880 as much as it would a rider from 2020.
