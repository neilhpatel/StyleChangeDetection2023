Thanks. It makes sense that they'd treat a "disqualified" the same you would incapacitated. But, what happens if there's a legal ambiguity as to qualifications. I paid all of 3 seconds to the birther nonsense during Obama, but I remember seeing something about an "even if..." defense of Obama that spoke to the ambiguity of "natural born citizen".
As a hypoethetical...let's say POTUS and VP are killed, and there's some ambiguity as to whether the Speaker is a natural born citizen. And we're at war, so time is of the essence.
In this case, if POTUS and VPOTUS were simultaneously incapacitated, the Presidency would simply be assumed by the Senate president pro tem as the next person after Speaker,, or if they were also naturalized, then SecState, etc....
I really like Lieu. He's not a feckless weakling like many of the Dem leaders. He's the one that got Mueller to admit that Trump would have been indicted if he wasn't president.
He's the one that got Mueller to admit Trump would have been indicted if he weren't president. Too bad the Dems just kinda did nothing with that and let Mueller walk it back.
And instead of seizing the moment, the Dem leadership just sort of did nothing and let Mueller walk it back. They should have immediate paused the proceedings right then and there -- emergency recess -- to discuss that blockbuster statement and let it resonate.
