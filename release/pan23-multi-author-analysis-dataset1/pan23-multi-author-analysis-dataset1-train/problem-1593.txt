For example, a (very brief) glance at the Nashville Beautification Committee and metro code they operate under suggests that they have no actual power -- they exist to advise the mayor, and while they have the same First Amendment right to share their opinion with you as anyone else does, they have no ability to impose fines, trespass on your land, interfere with your property, etc., and if I were you I'd respond to them (copying the mayor and various other actual government officials) that it is improper and likely unlawful for them to speak under color of authority when no such authority exists, they are impersonating the government, and that legal action will be forthcoming should they continue to do so.
I found some info that might be helpful. Metro Beautification and Environment Commission Intentional Design for Vegetative Growth.Metro Code 10.28.010 approval request is needed yearly now apparently, and if we want this group to leave us alone, we would need to either go through a lenhy approval process, or we would need to pay a yearly fine.
