The reality is that neither side is willing to make the politically explosive concessions necessary, including the moderates on either side. Even under the most centrist Israeli government or left to center, that wouldn’t happen. The same holds for the Palestinians.
In the case of Gaza, there is no negotiating with Hamas. That’s an additional problem. There’s no real reason for Israel to make significant concessions to go for peace if there’d be no peace in Gaza anyway.
Neither side is in favour of a one-state solution, so West Bank and Gaza Palestinians wouldn’t really get to have a say in Israel’s democracy in any case.
Besides that, a large percentage of Palestinians simply reject the notion that Israel has a right to exist, so that doesn’t really work for a peaceful resolution to this conflict.
The two big ones from West Bank Palestinian Authority is a) splitting Jerusalem and b) effectively demanding millions of Palestinians to get Israeli citizenship and live there if they desire.
Well said. The Palestinians have time and again shown that they are not partners for peace. The world has had far too much patience with the Palestinian leadership rejecting peace time and time again. Once the world and specifically the Arab world shows that they are tired of their nonsense and move on and make peace with Israel, the Palestinians will finally get on the train before it leaves the station once and for all.
