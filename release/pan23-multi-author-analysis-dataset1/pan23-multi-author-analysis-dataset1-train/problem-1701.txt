Like, idek which contexts you could expect to get the state to help you. Imagine you intend to leave some nazi group or the like and report on their crimes. You do that and you essentially have to get into witness protection, but the context of that are court cases. Case over, secret identity and whatever you got during the proceedings to protect you are gone. Good luck, have fun lad.
protecting individual action is either unrealizable because the name of the whistleblower will be out there and discrimination is very hard to prove, or will lead to even worse ideas like being able to report wrongdoing anonymously, opening the door to all kind of malfeasance.
Are you bloody mad? Journalists are getting regularly assassinated simply for reporting on wrongdoing. If protection of the identity of whistleblowers is not possible it absolutely needs to be anonymous. And there is no issue with malfeasance that we do not already have - if you want to spread lies about someone you can already send a made up bullshit story anonymously to a journalist, just make sure it's click bait worthy.
