>	“In December 2012, FdI emerged from a right-wing split within Silvio Berlusconi's party, The People of Freedom (PdL).[19] The bulk of FdI's leadership including Meloni, who has led the party since 2014, as well as the symbol of the movement (the tricolour flame),[20] comes from the post-fascist National Alliance (AN), which was founded in 1995 and merged into PdL in 2009.[21] AN was the successor to the Italian Social Movement (MSI), active from 1945 to 1995,[22][23] a neo-fascist party founded by former members of the banned National Fascist Party (1921–1943) and the Republican Fascist Party (1943–1945).[24][25][26]”.
The president of the Jewish community, Ruth Dureghello, addressed the premier saying: "President Meloni, I really appreciated your words in your inaugural speech and at the ceremony for the Jewish journalists expelled from the Order. Not because I didn't know your positions before you held this office but because I believe that in your role as Prime Minister, these words help to definitively contrast the ambiguities that are still present in a part of the country regarding fascism and its responsibilities".
