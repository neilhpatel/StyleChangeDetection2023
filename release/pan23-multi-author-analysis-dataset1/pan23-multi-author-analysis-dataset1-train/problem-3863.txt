In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Not really. I mean POTUS control over federal agencies isn't due to their geography. As it is many agencies HQs are already outside of DC in Maryland and Virginia and they are way more field offices throughout the country.
Digitize everything. People should be able to pull up records without going through ridiculous forms and filings only to be rejected for no good reason. Every vote by a politician, every line of every draft of a bill, every word uttered on the debate floor, every outcome of a committee discussion, all of it there for anyone who would have it. (except in cases of national security and even then there's a timeframe for release). There should never be any voice vote or raising of hands where you can't tell exactly what your elected officials voted for. Total transparency in that regard.
