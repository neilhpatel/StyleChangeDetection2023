Sanctions were crucial in degrading Russia’s combat and industrial manufacturing power, diminishing their ability to operate their war machine at “full tilt”, but the depth of their cold-war stockpiles and the necessity of continuing imports of gas/oil for Europe gave them flexibility in that and a ton of financial ammo to prop up their currency and pivot their economy away from international markets.
