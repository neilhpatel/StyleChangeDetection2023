The persistent rumor was that they had learned their lessons in Georgia and had quietly reformed and upgraded their armed forces over the last 14 years. Also Ukraine did pretty much roll over for Crimea and was fought to a stalemate over the other breakaway regions, so there was some reason to believe (at least publicly in the west) that Russia might be able to steamroll over Ukraine proper.
If they had managed what they had hoped - take Ukraine in a week with little fighting - they would have immediately moved on to take Moldova, as they already control the part of it on the Ukraine border that's called Transnistria.
Konigsberg historically is Prussian. By Prussian meaning the now extinct western Baltic tribes which were assimilated during the Northern Crusades by Teutonic Order (which was not German, cause Germany did not exist back then either lol).
This is the real deal. NATO is not a security threat. It is a threat to Russia's colonial ambitions in central Europe. These our colonies, why u stopping us from colonizing them?
