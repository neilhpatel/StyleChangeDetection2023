So many smaller countries can continue to exist as generous liberal social welfare states, because the pathologically hyper-competitive United States underpins their national security with its titanic military and NATO alliance, and purchases and consumes all their resources and products with its heedless appetites and vast unequal conglomerations of wealth. If it weren't for that toxicity, Scandinavia for example would be robbed bare and bombed out by imperialist warlords cynically masquerading as though theocrats on one side and communists on the other.
