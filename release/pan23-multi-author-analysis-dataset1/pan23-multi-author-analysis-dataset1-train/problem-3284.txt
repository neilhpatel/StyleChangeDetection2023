They also have like the largest arsenal of amphibious attack craft and should double that number in about 5 years. They also have shore based anti ship missiles that out range US Naval carrier aircraft without refueling. So the Carrier group will have to sit further outside and aircraft based strikes would have to be refueled mid air before they could reach. The air force can deploy cargo plane dropped missile pods to overwhelm air defenses and start taking out the anti ship missiles, but they shoot and scoot. The US Air Force will rule the night skies with the B21 but that's a lot of mission.

Overwhelming republican support. The will to fuck china up overrides any "no blank cheque" sentiment regarding ukraine. .
