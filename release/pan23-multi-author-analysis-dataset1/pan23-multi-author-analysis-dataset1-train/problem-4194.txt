Militarily, the Qing state was little better off. While there were nominally 600,000 or so Han Chinese troops in the Green Standard Army, this figure is for many reasons misleading. First off, the Green Standard Army's function was in part to function as a sort of gendarmerie and auxiliary labour support for the civil government, as well as local peacekeeping. As such, by the 1840s the mobilisation of military resources was a normal and necessary part of provincial administration, and during the Opium War no province outside the two main areas of fighting (Guangdong and Zhejiang) spared more than 25% of its Green Standard garrison towards the war effort. On top of that, rampant corruption meant that a large number of troops (though exact numbers are unclear) existed only on paper. The Banner garrisons, meanwhile, were always quite thin in southern China, with the primary concentrations being in Beijing, Manchuria and Xinjiang, and although the Qing occasionally mobilised significant Banner formations during the Taiping War (most notably a mixed force of around 30,000 Banner and Mongol cavalry under Duolonga), the need to maintain the Banner population in their garrisons, both to keep the urban Han Chinese population in line and to avoid throwing them at the genocidally-minded Taiping, was quite palpable.
Awesome response, thank you so much for the time and trouble. Any follow up reading on the specific points that you lay out that you would recommend to a non-Chinese-reading person?
