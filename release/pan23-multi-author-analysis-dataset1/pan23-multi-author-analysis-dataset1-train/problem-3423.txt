The legislation, filed Friday, comes three months after Maryland voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum to legalize cannabis for adults 21 and older and is expected to generate earnest debate about what the billion-dollar industry should look like. The planned launch of the new market comes on the heels of a botched rollout of the state’s medical cannabis industry that initially shut out Black applicants.
Ensuring minorities have a stake in the legal sale of recreational cannabis was a central part of last year’s debate and became the reason standing up the legal market was delayed.
An omnibus bill to stand up Maryland’s legal cannabis market gives medical cannabis license holders first dibs on selling recreational cannabis and seeks to foster social equity — something lawmakers say no other state has managed to do.
The bill allows people with medical cannabis licenses who were up and running by last October to enter the recreational market, with a one-time conversion fee based on their 2022 sales. For example, growers would have to pay $100,000 if their gross revenue was under $1 million and $2.5 million if their gross revenue was more than $20 million.
