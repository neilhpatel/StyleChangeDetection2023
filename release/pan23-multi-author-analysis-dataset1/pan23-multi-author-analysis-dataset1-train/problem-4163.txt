I wouldn't respond, but if you'd like to respond, it should be to ask him for an address to which you can send a debt validation letter. If he declines to give you an address or insists that he's somehow not obligated to comply with the FDCPA, you can assume he's either a scammer or an unscrupulous but real debt collector who is willing to violate the FDCPA. If he gives you an address, you should send the debt validation letter via certified mail within 30 days of initial contact. This letter helps you vet the collector's veracity, it also prevents the debt collector from pursuing the debt until such time as they validate it. You can find sample DV letters here : in your letter, if you wish, you can ask for more information about the debt, tell the debt collector that the debt is not yours or that it's past the SOL, and tell them not to contact you again or specify that they only contact you in writing.
Ok. I called back and asked for an address to send a debt validation letter and he claims “we’re past that point now that legal action is nigh” essentially.
