The English took the proposal with a high degree of scepticism because even though it made some sense, they were a bit wary of previous Moroccan failed promises. They also recently experienced a failure with their Roanoke colony which probably put them off interfering in America for a while, and were at that moment actually in a phase of cooling down the conflict of the Spanish. English merchants of London were additionally hostile to Moroccan embassy thinking it to be conducting commercial espionage (there is also the possibility of the newly formed East India Company could have tried to sabotage the plan of the western expansion to keep the funds concentrated on east, but this is just an idea some historians entertain).
Gonna agree with /u/terminus-trantor (thanks for the mention!): Morocco did not have the capacities for a large scale invasion of Iberia; it rather sent the quite damaging corsairs. The only Muslim power capable of this in the 16th century were the Ottomans, which the Castilian monarchs feared. However after the major naval defeat at Lepanto, from the 1570s on the Ottoman Empire would focus expansions east instead of west.
