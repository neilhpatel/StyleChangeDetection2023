Have recent debates had much of an impact on confederate monuments either being removed or being critically contextualized (like some people have talked about during recent debates)?
Hi! Are you aware of a similar "Lost Cause" phenomenon being so widespread, pervasive and influential anywhere else on the globe and in history? Germany in the aftermath of WW1 (and perhaps even WW2) sort of comes to mind but ultimately does not seem to have reached anywhere near the levels of the Confederate cause and its impact on US history. Perhaps there are other examples?
My book discusses how myths about the horrors white supposedly experienced during Reconstruction (such as the disenfranchisement of Confederate veterans) were often exaggerated/fabricated for political ends and how the white supporters of Reconstruction have often been forgotten/erased.
Hi! Thank you for doing this. I've heard that some textbooks were labeled "Unfair To The South" for their depiction of the war or slavery - was this connected to the Dunning school who vilified Reconstruction, or something different?
3. There is definitely room for that. I have a chapter in an edited volume under review currently that discusses how the Lost Cause narrative of history was used to justify colonialism across the world. It is a topic in need of more research. Hopefully one day it will come out in book form.
