On the topic of salt-mining, the main reason for that is that mining salt is hard. Really hard. Prolonged exposure in the salt mines meant very fast dehydratation for the workers( either because of the constant salt dust in the air or just being around it). On top of that, excessive intake of sodium(salt is Sodium Chloride fyi) causes increased blood pressure which can lead to strokes or heart attacks. Because of these reasons, salt mining was a rather dangerous endeavour. As an anecdote, there is a russian saying from the 18th century back to the salt mines, credited to refer to punishing prisoners to work in the salt mines of Siberia. That probably means it wasn't too pleasant.
I haven't been able find any references to the modius changing substantially over time, and I did come across an in the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities which describes how the Temple of Jupiter kept a standard model to define the volume unit Amphora (of which the modius is a derived unit: 3 modii = 1 amphora), both of which did suggest long-term standardization of the unit.
Now, a couple of caveats. It is true that throughout world history, in a handful of places salt has indeed been used for trade. By this I don't mean using as a replacement for coins, but using salt bars among a set of other commodities as a way of storing and exchanging value.
