OMG, can we over use the word "slam" enough for news organizations to stop using it? I slam any news org that uses slam too damn much. It's time we slam the use of slam.
There are reports that Russian soldiers are told to leave their dead in Ukraine so that the deceased soldiers official status in Russia is “missing in action” instead of “killed in action”, because there is supposed to be payments made by the Russian government to the deceased soldier’s families. How twisted is that?
So I guess the question is, do you try to stay independent and wait for conflict to break out so that you can be subjugated by the necessities of a hot war, or do you pick a side and get all the benefits of the association in peacetime and all the protection that will be provided against some other aggressive government trying to take you over?
Yes. I hate this word so much. It's only usefull quality Is that it immediately identifies a story as clickbait or filler. I physically cringe when I hear professional broadcasters say it out loud.
