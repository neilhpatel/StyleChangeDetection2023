For so many years, decades even, russia has been living off this fear they presented to the world. Of their army, of their military might, their military weapons, their military intelligence. They showed themselves as ravenous bears on the battlefield. In reality, that masquerade popped as though that ravenous bear was truthfully a balloon bear.
Exactly. From the outside, we see the mass slaughter of Russian soldiers and think: They haven't changed their strategy at all!
Everybody deserves empathy. Including yourself, by realising that you can still understand what conditions drive people to do what they do, and how a person can be shaped into something terrible. The word you're looking for is 'sympathy'. No sympathy. But fuck me if I'm gonna look at some dude who turned 18 a month ago and has never had a chance to effectively change Russia's course because they were an actual kid, and say: "Yeah, his compatriots have been horrible. Let's turn him into red mist and watch footage of it like this is a fucked up reality show.".
The Red Army started the war as a tank and horse army not significantly dissimilar from the Wehrmacht (although significantly less well organized, led and experienced), and ended it as a mechanized colossus largely based on Anglo-American trucks and logistical vehicles.
I find this fascinating. This war is horrible, but as an observer of military conflicts and one who studies past wars in history, this has been very interesting. Between the determination of the Ukrainian army, citizens, and leaders, to the idiotic choices of russia and their military incompetence.
So yes. You're talking about sympathy, not empathy, and the invaders deserve none. But empathy isn't for Russians. Empathy is for you.
