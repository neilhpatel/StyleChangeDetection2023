To be fair, it wasn't like any other state intelligence agencies from the west accurately predicted Russia's actual military readiness.

What the fuck am I reading? A nation that has probably killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions in Ukraine is complaining about the US using,.... psychics? Brainwashing? What is the complaint here.
I'm assuming that Russian propaganda about how much safer the front lines are than they are reinforced by the commanders of the army leads the soldiers to think the US is psychic when in reality we simply have far advanced intelligence that Russian cannon fodder is intentionally prevented from knowing about.
