"We are often told they are much bigger, their army is way larger, they have more resources, and there are far fewer of us. Never say that to countries that love Freedom more than anything! Never say that to us or to our Finnish brothers. Your words mean nothing to us or to them.".
Almost everyone is apolitical. They don't care. They don't want to get involved. It's not their problem.
Absolutely! Russia is a bully that only understands strenh. This is something that some countries still don't understand. Diplomacy is for Russia only a ploy to buy more time to plan their crimes.
Actually those are mercenaries. Wagner said only it's troops are operating at Soledar today. They sent VDV to Bakhmut to break the impasse there, Wagner devised a plan and then executed it. The plan was to get so far to the west to block the only supply route with artillery fire. It kinda sorta worked. However Ukrainian aviation solved at least some of the issues. Also Wagner doesn't have much artillery ammo after Ukrainian raid two days ago.
