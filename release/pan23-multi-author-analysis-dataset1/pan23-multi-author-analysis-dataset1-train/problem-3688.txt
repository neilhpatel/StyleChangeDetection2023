second - the post is about a desantis initiative where people are getting arrested for acting in good faith and exercising rights they reasonably believe they still hold - while the one you linked is about a person who was arrested for an ongoing effort to try to prevent people from exercising the rights they DO hold.
The FBI are not democrats. They are not a politically-affiliated organization at all. What is being stated as fact in this article by a notoriously biased right-wing news organization (with no citations to back it up, no statements from officers involved or any other actual journalism on display) is the account from the wife of the arrested person. There is no evidence to back up her claim. And her own photo of the “raid” shows 3 or 4 FBI agents calmly standing on her porch, not a drawn gun in site.

Furthermore, this was not a politically-motivated arrest. This was an arrest for assault in the shoving of a 73 year old man.
