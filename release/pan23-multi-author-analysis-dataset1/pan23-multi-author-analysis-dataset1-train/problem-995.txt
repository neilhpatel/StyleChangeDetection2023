Yeah fair enough, I kind of figured I was probably legally in the wrong from what I remembered in drivers training. I do think the guy was kind of a prick about it given that I had already started moving quite a ways through the intersection, and he most likely observed this well before it was physically possible for him to pull out without hitting the car which was also passing through going the other direction, but I'll take it as a lesson learned to not make assumptions and drive more defensively in a situation like that, and perhaps be more considerate of other drivers as well. Thank you for checking that out for me.
You could make the case that by waiting so long after you entered the intersection, the other driver had yielded the right of way to you, but it's a nitty factual argument and you don't really want to be in the position of explaining that one to an ICBC claims adjuster after a collision, as the other driver is likely to say they started their turn as soon as it was safe to do so and that you cut them off.
Yeah, I think that's pretty much what happened. No big deal at the end of the day as there was no accident, though I think I will be more cautious in the future. Thanks for your input.
