In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

My dream scenario for this situation is a dozen "governing Republicans" rebel against the Freedom Caucus and work with Dems to install an independent speaker for two years, probably a moderate former Republican (I don't know if Cheney is moderate enough honestly, she's still quite conservative).
