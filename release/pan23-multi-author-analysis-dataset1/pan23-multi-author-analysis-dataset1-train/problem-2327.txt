Trump knows that his time as a free man is running out. He can no longer hide behind a DOJ memo on the prosecution of sitting presidents or rely on appointed stooges to obstruct justice for him. His organization was just found guilty on all charges in a major criminal tax fraud case, and his sham lawsuit against the DNC and others was tossed, with prejudice, for total lack of merit and his lawyers punished with fines and rebuke. His mierda’s touch demolished the GOP’s latest election chances and resulted in a historically terrible midterm performance that nearly all analyses attribute directly to Trump and his lies about stolen elections. His violent coup attempt failed and 400+ of his idiot supporters have now been found guilty, including on charges of sedition. Trump is a reprehensible loser and he’s watching his fascist ambitions melt to a pile and trickle down to mix with the tanner and runny shit constantly pooling at his feet.

Possibly. Either that, or he remains confident he is still is President, and will be successful in rewriting the Constitution.
