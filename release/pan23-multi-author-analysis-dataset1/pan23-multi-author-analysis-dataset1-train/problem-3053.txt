If you're in the United States not Montana you can be fired for any reason but a few protected by law. Or no reason at all.
edit - i also have and went through my employee policy handbook and nowhere in the conflict of interest section does it mention anything about moonlighting or anything with outside income other than any income that would directly conflict with them (ie working for another pharma, hospital, or doctor).
Something doesn't add up. It feels like there's something they're not telling you (not that they are obligated to). As a result of a reported performance issue, they investigated you and apparently learned something during the investigation which caused them to believe you were moonlighting. But not just moonlighting, specifically performing work for your previous employer. If their story is to be believed, they likely found digital evidence on their IT systems which suggested that, found digital evidence elsewhere, or contacted someone who suggested (or confirmed) that.
