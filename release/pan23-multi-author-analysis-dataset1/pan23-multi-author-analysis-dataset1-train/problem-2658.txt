People give NATO a lot of shit because 80% of their military forces are non-combat arms but there’s a reason why we can sustain multi-decade major combat ops in Iraq and Afghanistan while Russia can’t supply its troops inside a nation it shares a land boarder with. POG pride baby!
This sub is rife with warmongering sociopathic masked as clout chasing international solidarity. We learn nothing from the past. The whataboutists would call me a Russia apologist. I just know how to spot us getting back to our same old bullshit.
Ukraine is also developing a far better logistics chain so it’s entirely possible that Russia May end up suffering far more casualties as we move to the end of winter, we know there have been accounts of Russian soldiers being found frozen to death because Russian logistics are absolute garbage. Environmental casualties are still casualties.
So what? By your logic I should say “Ukraine should just surrender” because it’s “less cowardly”. You can support a war effort without having to go into the fray if you’re not qualified to do so. You pretty much sound like a russia apologist at this point. Nobody has to occupy russia either. This is about expelling russian forces from Ukraine. Stop moving the goalposts here.
