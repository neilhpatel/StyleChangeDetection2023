Fast forward 40 years. Dad passed away, and Mom wanted to sell the house and move closer to the kids and grandchildren. 3 days before closing, the escrow company called to tell me that they found a recorded bank "mortgage" on the property for $15,000 (bells go off). They FAX a copy of the recorded mortgage over to me (I look at the signatures and they are nowhere close to Mom's and Dad's). I go home, pack a bag and drive 8 hours across 2 states over to Mom's place. Explain what's going on and she looks at me sort of funny - disappears back to the bedroom, rummages through her closet (the ultimate filing cabinet) for about 10 minutes - and reappears with 1) a stack of canceled checks paying off the loan, along with her budget books showing each loan payment; 2) their copy of the original loan papers; 3) the collateral agreement; 4) copies of the stock certificates; 5) the collateral return receipt when the certificates were returned; 6) the bank's original loan agreement stamped paid, notarized and signed by a bank officer (their only minor flaw was not recording the payoff - but since it was not a mortgage it was not necessary).
Take a deep breath. There's a good chance you can resolve this without going to court, but it is going to take some work on your part.
