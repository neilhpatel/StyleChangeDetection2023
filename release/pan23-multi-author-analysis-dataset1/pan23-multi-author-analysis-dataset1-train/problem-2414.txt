The EU has the same issues as the Polish Commonwealth or the USA under the Articles of Confederation. While the liberum veto encourages nations like Hungary to stay within the EU, it stops decision-making.
Actually no. This the money comes from the EU budget which is funded by the individual countries which take individual loans themself. Hungary is cut of from some specific EU grands but in total they are still an net receiver of EU funds. So from all the money they pay to the EU, they get more in return even when the EU is granting a part of the budget to Ukraine. Which is true on the other hand is that these grants in total might reduce the money which Hungary gets from the overall EU budget.
The protesters faced violent persecution by the authorities. A statement by the United Nations Human Rights Office on 1 September cited more than 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, as well as reports of sexual abuse and rape.\[75\] At the end of 2020, the Viasna Human Rights center documented 1,000 testimonies of torture victims.\[76\].
I wish. You would think politicians would be better read in history, yet they keep making the same short-sighted decisions. History keeps rhyming because people don't learn from history.
