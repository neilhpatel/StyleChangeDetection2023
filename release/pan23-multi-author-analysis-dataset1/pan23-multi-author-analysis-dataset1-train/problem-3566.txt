In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Jfc. This is the same party that uses executive privilege for everything with their pres but it can't be used by others?! These people, man. I hope they try and Biden laughs in their face.
Exactly. It would just be tons of lying bs thrown at Biden and complete disrespect. He has to just tell them to f off. Maybe let a few folks who punch back from his admin testify but mostly executive privilege and ignore the ferals in House GOP.

The republican capacity for doublethink is limitless. They will readily praise Trump for ignoring subpoenas while condemning Biden for doing the same, without feeling any cognitive dissonance whatsoever.
No it doesn't. Dem house investigations were on actual crimes against America. POTUS has not committed any crimes. There are a few people that Biden should allow to testify that will backfire on GOP and and cost them future power. Otherwise he should just executive privilege the whole thing.
