Iâ€™ve visited and I am aware of how much is made and used for internal consumption, but there was an intrinsic component of their culture that was a representation of freedom. How westernised their malls were and how many name brands they used on their daily lives.
By intervening in Russia-Ukraine war west already decided that events in this region is their area of responsibility, to support democracy and oppose authoritarianism in other countries. Which is great and i totally support, and only suggest nothing but being consistent, realize faults of not opposing Putin when he was way weaker while already showing his authoritarian nature. (Which is, btw, hot topic in russian opposition circles too, why 90-s democratic government and then opposition failed to stop rise of authoritarianism).
Think so? That doesn't explain why it spikes at mobilization, does it? It points more to selfish concern, if you ask me. The article posted doesn't put forward this assertion. What is the basis for this?
And and same time i would ask to understand, that just as europe is not ready to give up its comfort by cutting trade with Russia immediately and entirely (even when europe realised full danger of russian regime), russian opposition is not ready to give up their lives and freedom for the same cause (thought many were ready and already gave up their freedom or lives).
