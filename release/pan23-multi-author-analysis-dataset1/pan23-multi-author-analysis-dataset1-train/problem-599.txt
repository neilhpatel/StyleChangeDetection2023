So I felt tempted to say that the author's talking out of his backside, but that seems overly generous. There's plenty of research, some quite old, into the development of gunpowder in China, some of which is more available than others. Vol. 5, Part 7 of Joseph Needham's Science and Civilization in China from 1987 is all about gunpowder, though it's comparatively hard to get your hands on except via a library . Personally, I recommend Tonio Andrade's more recent book, The Gunpowder Age (2016), which is more up-to-date and gives a clear and concise overview of the development of gunpowder technology with a focus on China and Western Europe. While it's true that original documents are going to be hard to find and hard to develop the skills to read, these two volumes should include plenty in translation (and much artistic and archaeological evidence) for you to pore over. As for the linked website, well...
/u/EnclavedMicrostate asked me to look into Mohi for you, and the only detailed contemporary account of the battle, by Thomas of Split, says only that the Mongol artillery launched large rocks and that after the Hungarians had retreated to their camp teams of men had come in close to the wagons in order to set fire to them. I have come across a secondary source mentioning that fire-pots, possibly a primitive grenade, were used later in the year during a siege, but I haven't been able to verify this since the original source is Chinese.
