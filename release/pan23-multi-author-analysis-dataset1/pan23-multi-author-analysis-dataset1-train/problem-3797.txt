Well there’s the rub. One can only speculate to the mass appeal, as the book may have sold well precisely because of the debate it stirred up- sort of a rehashing of the Historikerstreit but now in the mid-1990s in a post Schindler’s List era. The book offers a simple solution to complicated historical nuances- that the Germans were deeply anti-semitic and that the Holocaust was inevitable (the intentionalist perspective but taken beyond the time period of National Socialism). Goldhagen was invited to give televised debates to sold out crowds in Germany and there was a sense that to while his book may have been argumentatively flawed, he should be lauded for the public debates his work caused. To criticise his work was therefore to engage in a continuation of anti-Semitism and holocaust denial. So he offered a simple thesis that could be embraced by second and third generation Germans looking for an easy explanation about the ‘sins of their fathers’ so to speak. According to David Art: ‘the open-mindedness that Goldhagen encountered in the land of the perpetrators’ was something Germans could be rally behind during a time period when Germany was undergoing a rehashing of the coming to terms with their Nazi past and timed with the 50 year anniversary of the Holocaust and construction of new monuments- all compounded with reunification as the Berlin Wall had recently fallen so Germany was undergoing intensive changes through things like the moving of the West German capital from Bonn to Berlin, accompanied by new Holocaust memorials.
Thanks for this post, it's extremely interesting. I have a question about the scholarly assessment of Hitler's Willing Executioners: looking at the WIkipedia page, it seems the book was pretty widely despised by the scholarly community when it came out. Is that still the case today? Or has the consensus on this book changed?
