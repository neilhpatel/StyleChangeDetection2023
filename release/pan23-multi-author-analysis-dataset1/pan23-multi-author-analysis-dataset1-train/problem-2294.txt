Prepare yourself, this is an extremely lenhy and unnescessarily complicated explanation. Also, it didn't fit in a single comment, so I continued it in the replies. Click the link at the bottom of each comment for a short-cut.
Basically. At least if we're going by the standard of the legal definition, there has to be the intent to kill a portion of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. If a government is engaging in reckless or callous policies that cause or increase the deaths of large numbers of people through famine, it's not necessarily genocide, even if they are ultimately responsible for those mass deaths.
Yes it is! There's in interesting parallel in the sense that in both contexts, 'thug' often carries racialized connotations. But of a completely different sort.
I've read about some of the history of that famine, and I've sort of tentatively come to the conclusion that it's a similar genocide edge case like the Irish famine and the Holodomor; an argument could be made that there wasn't enough specifically ethnically/racially motivated intent, but it could also be reasonable to consider them genocide, one for which Great Britain and especially Churchill could be held responsible.
