Currently re-reading a book called "La Mythologie Slave" by Louis LÃ¨ger. It's one of the first scientific books on the topic of Slavic mythology, beeing published in 1901. Although he was trained philologist, he based his books almost only on written sources, so it's an interesting inquiry if someone is interested in the questions about pre-Christian Slavic religion. He cites many medieval sources that can then lead you to further investigation.
There are some great books about Jewish labor organizing, socialism, radicalism, and anti-fascism during the 20th century, a good recent one is "Radical Jews: a Documentary Reader, and "Revolutionary Yiddishland: a History of Jewish Radicalism" which focuses both on socialist and Jewish anti-fascist movements. Another is "Jewish Unions in America" by Bernard Weinstein, and the classic "A Fire in Their Hearts: Yiddish Socialists in New York" by Tony Michels. There's also just a ton of top quality Yiddish socialist/radical/unionist music out there to listen to while you're reading.
