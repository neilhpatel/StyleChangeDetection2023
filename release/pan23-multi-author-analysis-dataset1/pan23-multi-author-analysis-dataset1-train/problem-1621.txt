The uniform child custody jurisdiction act requires a child to be living in a state for 6 months before that state will have jurisdiction over the child. Otherwise jurisdiction will be in the last state where the child did live for 6 months and if no such state exists the state where the child was born. If a child is taken from the state where jurisdiction is proper and a case is filed in that state by the remaining parent prior to the 6 month mark an order will be issued requiring the child to be brought back to the prior state and that state will manage the custody proceedings until such time as both parents have permanently moved out of the state. Unless there is a court order in place itâ€™s generally not illegal to take a child out of the state without consent of the other legal parent, however the court may frown upon it and if an order to return the child is ignored it would become a criminal issue.
No. If she moves out if state and her ex files in court for a custody order, the court will order her to return the child to Illinois immediately and stay until the issue is resolved. She cannot move. And again, who you are or how nice your house is mean nothing. You are not a parent to this child.
