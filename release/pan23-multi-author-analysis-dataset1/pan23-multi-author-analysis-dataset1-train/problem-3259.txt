Take TV Rain and how again it's being hated by many Russians, most Ukrainians and many Latvians. And while they are anti-putin and anti-war, they said some really strange things like how they are helping struggling russian soldiers, and also showed strange reportages like the one about russian flags over occupied territories and how people are accepting being "returned" to russia etc., basically Kremlin propaganda.
russian propaganda has done a good job of making most anti-govt russian-speaking sources look bad for the internal audience. And I feel like some of them are intentionally making themselves look bad.
Fascism is extremely effective. Repetitive nationalism combined with the demonisation of an enemy entity is enough for most, while the remaining opposing voices are forcibly silenced.
I hope that's the case. However, Fareed Zakaria just had a correspondent in Moscow on his show who said that Russian families who have lost relatives in the invasion are doubling down. So it sounds complicated.
