I would recomend the works of Brazilian social scientist Gilberto Freyre (tutored by none other than Franz Boaz himself) called "Casa-Grande & Senzala" and "Sobrados & Mucambos" for sociological explanations about race dynamics in Brazil. The second book sheds light on the urban dynamic, racial miscigenation and explains why racism in Brazil, although bad, "is not as bad as in the US", which had (and still has) very segregated racial profiles and institutionally ingrained racism further feed by cultural aspects, while in Brazil the institutional aspect was uncomparably mild and urban population was mixing. I think it is fairly relevant to the sub because he makes use of extensive historical records, besides being an Brazilian with an American higher education.
1. If you're interested in a case study/microhistory of Brazilian slavery, I can't recommend "Dutra's World" by Zephyr Frank highly enough. It's an account of a Brazilian slave turned slave owner, and his complex place in Brazilian society in the first half of the 19th century.
I'll quote a couple of paragraphs from a paper I wrote in grad school, comparing and contrasting American and Brazilian slavery systems:
In a single word, the difference between the United States and Brazil (in terms of race and slavery) is fluidity.
In Latin America, racial constructs were more nuanced. In addition to people who were "purely" European, African, or Native, there were multiple pardo/mixed-race groups.
