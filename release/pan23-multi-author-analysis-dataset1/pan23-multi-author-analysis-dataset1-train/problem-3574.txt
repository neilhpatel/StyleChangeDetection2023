Secondly, we do not require people to post sources unless someone asks for them. This is a common misunderstanding. Sources alone do not make a good answer and simply posting sources will not let you get away with a bad one! What we're looking for is that show a familiarity with the sources and scholarly literature on the topic. This is usually apparent whether you cite sources or not. We remove anything that falls short, on the principle that "no answer is better than a bad answer": better not to learn anything than to learn falsehoods and nonsense you'll only have to un-learn again later.
Thank God! It was so frustrating dealing with the arrogance. Nothing ever seemed to get answered because youe seemed to need a doctorate in how to write a thesis in said subject to be able to answer it.
Congratulations to the new moderators. This is by far the best subreddit on the website and your hard work and [deleted] make it all possible! Thank you and good luck.
Personally I know and love the music of the Belle Epoque in France the most (Faur√© being my favorite composer), but not many people ask about Alberic Magnard around here, so I've mainly answered questions on the 1812 Overture, Mozart, Greensleeves, and other more general (and popular!) classical music topics.
Damn, you all are some arrogant folks. I rarely see anyone get a straight answer on here anyways. I've seen some brilliant answers that were historically on point but someone gets their knickers in a twist and deletes the whole thread comment by comment.
