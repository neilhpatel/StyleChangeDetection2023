What a clown. It's like he's trying to make politics out of something that should just be about solidarity and support for Ukraine. Let him keep pretending he cares about people when really all he wants is attention.
“The author, who has a history of “discrediting” science, said the review’s findings “ought to be the final nail in this particular coffin,” despite the fact that the review mentions a number of issues and limitations including that “relatively low numbers of people followed the guidance about wearing masks or about hand hygiene, which may have affected the results of the studies.”.
So? Isn’t that the whole point of showing support for a cause? To…you know…show support? You don’t have to support any particular cause if you don’t want to, and that doesn’t make you any worse or better than people who do. How insecure are these people?
“However, Dr. Marc Siegel, professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, pointed out a key limitation: “The researchers focus primarily on randomized trials, but most of the studies that have been done on masks are population studies,” he said.
What an asshat. That's not how you show support for Ukraine. If he really wanted to help, he should donate or find a way to show genuine solidarity instead of using it as a fashion statement.
