Oh boy, this just opens up a topic... German unification is more complicated than often suggested by the post-unification narrative that is told in Germany and elsewhere and the most important part about it is that in some ways re-unification as such was a surprising development for a lot of people in East and West. Today, we hear about the German's massive desire for re-unification but in a lot of ways, the opposition in East Germany as well as a variety of political currents in West Germany expected the GDR to be reformed and to become a democratic state or one that was socialist but different to the previous order.
It needs to be stressed that by the time the first parliamentary elections in the GDR rolled around in 1990, unification was still not something that seemed realistic to most people in both Germanies â€“ like a far away dream. But then there was both the currency union and the ok from the Allied powers, including the Soviet Union and re-unification suddenly became a realistic possibility.
Thanks. I would be interested to know how the anti-Germans ended up neocon. That's quite a transformation. Are there any good English sources about all this? Almost everything I come across online is in German.
