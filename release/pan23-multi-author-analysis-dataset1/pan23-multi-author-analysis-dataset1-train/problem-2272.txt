Obviously the solution is to side with the rail industry against the workers instead of forcing the rail industry to give a few paid sick days. Of course.
It's nice in theory to come up with plans to totally transform everything, but in real life, political capital is limited and it's hard to do much of anything at all, so it's better to focus on changing stuff that really needs change while leaving stuff alone if it works ok even if it's not perfect.
Workers got sick days. And a 24% raise. Most of the unions were in favor of the deal. They didnâ€™t get paid sick leave because of republicans and Joe Manchin. Plain and simple.
The government's intervention on behalf of "the economy" (billionaire profits) was a direct factor in the rail industry's (who have had record profits) refusal to give their workers some sick days. If they thought the strike might've actually had a chance of happening, they'd probably be a lot more receptive to the demands of the workers. But they knew their buddies in government would help them out.
