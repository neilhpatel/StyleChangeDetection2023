Like yes, we know the Taliban is fucked up and life sucks for women in these regions. That doesn’t mean this isn’t newsworthy. Saw so much of this in threads yesterday and it made me cringe. There’s nothing clever about being one of 10K people to declare you saw this coming. Like, good for you? The rest of us still want to hear what’s happening in the world and feel empathy for these women. This is life changing for millions of women and girls. Literally made them objects without rights.
I understand where ur coming from but i don't think it's lack of empathy (mostly) most people are just exhausted by the constant shit show, yeah there are a few shitty fucks who just want to be right nd smug, but i think most people are just exhausted and drained, just when u think it can't get any more worse, they just prove u wrong and ur just so helpless, the max u can say is of course what could we expect, just my two cents .
Gtfo of here with every woman in the country had a choice. They absolutely did not. If a small portion of them didn’t do the absolute most they could have done at one point it time that does not mean they all deserve to suffer. You are callous.
Not to sound callous here, but I spent a good part of my youth there helping the people, helping construct schools, providing security when they wouldn't do it themselves, and begging the local population to not allow the Taliban back into their areas.
