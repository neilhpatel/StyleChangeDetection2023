Korea might disagree with that. Then there's a small, little known group I suppose, called the Jews.
I'd say it's more you breaking into your ex's house with a knife, her beating the shit out of you while her new bf hands her blunt objects, and you proceed to demand to talk with the bf about peace as if he's the one currently turning your mouth into a dentist's worst nightmare/ next payday.
So that 27m number is not for Russia. That's for the USSR. For Russia as we know it the number is 13m. And I'm curious, in regards to suffering, how much of that was at the hands of their own leadership? That I'm aware of there was only one army which famously employed the use of barrier troops. Those troops are there to force poorly trained conscripts who are being otherwise slaughtered from running away. Now imagine how many fewer deaths there might have been if Soviet policies had allowed for war plans that consisted of something other than zerg rush until the Nazis either quit or they run out of dirt farmers.
