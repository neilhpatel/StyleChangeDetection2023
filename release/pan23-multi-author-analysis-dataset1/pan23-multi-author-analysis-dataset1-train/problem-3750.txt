I'm with the land doesn't vote crowd, but it is also a bad law. I like guns and shooting, but unfortunately we have been proven time and time again we can't be trusted without some form of gun control. We need good well thought out gun control and this isn't it. This law is pick and choose who gets to own firearms by the will of police departments, or even individual officers. If we can't limit guns we do need to have full registration with background checks. We should fold Firearms control into the current "Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission" and limit private sales and treat gun sales like alcohol sales. To buy even out of state alcohol you need to go through a liquor store in Oregon. To buy a gun you should have to go through a gun dealer who can register and perform a background check.
The majority of citizens who voted wanted it, important clarification. I'm in Oregon and the amount of people who didn't understand it or know about the bill is alarming. Huge failure amongst the gun activists in the state.
