I know Florida is a "right to work" state. I did not ever say it wasn't. I said OP was confusing "right to work" (which is a marketing term invented to make working people hate unions) with "at will" employment. Because the post didn't concern unions or union membership, the fact that Florida is a "right to work" state is totally irrelevant to the post, their question, and the situation.
What can your friend do? Well, there should be a procedure to contest the results. In most places I have worked, samples are immediately divided in two and sealed. The lab can test the B sample looking for MDMA. If it isn't there, then the lab likely had a contamination issue. These are fairly rare, but they do happen.
In either case the declaration of a positive test can result in disciplinary action consistent with the employer's policy, which could be anything up to and including immediate termination.
First, you have a drug screen. This is usually something that they stick in the fresh urine that changes color in the presence of drugs. Screens are basically a quick and cheap method of separating negatives and possible positives. This is a very important distinction. A negative screen has no drugs in it. A positive screen can only say that there may be drugs. There are similar compounds that can trigger a screen, and the trazadone metabolite is one of them. This is part of why screens can't be used to say a sample is positive for drugs. There are no such things as a false positive screen, as screens can't be used to declare a sample positive.
