My thoughts exactly. However I suspect the supply chain would be greatly disrupted if this was to come to pass. With a 50% morbidity you aren’t going to have people too anxious to work in stores and warehouses or factories. Restaurants would likely close and stay closed indefinitely. Ditto for most of retail. The economy would tank. Maybe there would be a few rounds of checks sent out from the government line with COVID but then the MTG’s and her ilk would start bellyaching about national debt or some such fuckery. But there would be nothing to spend your money on if the grocery stores are never restocked and there is no one to open the doors anyway. It would be the end of the world.
Now, I'm starting to understand why games and tutorials are made for people who might not have prior knowledge or experience in the subject, and sometimes, they may not take into account the needs of other users.
Nah. I think significant numbers of them will accept it once people are literally dying in the streets. But they'll claim no disease has ever killed 50% so it must be man made. Its what they do before huge numbers are dying everywhere that scares me. When we have a chance to contain it and the nuts decide efforts to eradicate it are some sinister plot.
