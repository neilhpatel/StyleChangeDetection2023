It will do more than trash the coastal cities. It will cause a mass algae bloom in the ocean and cause the north atlantics current to submerge or slow down as the water desalinates which will stop the transfer of warm water to the north causing polar storms during winter. Killing off some of the worlds largest wheat farms which will lead to a global food shortage. This will then have an impact on the shelf life insects which our very survival as a species relies on. The second that half of that ice melts off the Greenland sheet the world as we know it will be over. People will survive but the question is how and how many. As the things I listed above are the some of the certainties from these changes and don't include what happens after the cascade effect kicks in. This has become a matter of when and not if unless we fully understand and are able to efficiently use carbon capturing within the next 10 years.
Ffs. My comment was In no way in support of denying climate change. The two periods I linked are well studied and well within the fluctuations of the climate. You know what isn't though? The incredibly rapid warming in the last century or two. It, without a doubt, is caused by human activity.
