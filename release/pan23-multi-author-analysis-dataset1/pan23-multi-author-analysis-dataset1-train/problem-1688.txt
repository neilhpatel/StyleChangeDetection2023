I think there’s an issue here that’s easy to miss amidst all the emotive mud slinging and that’s that Ngozi Fulani seems to be a genuinely awful person and to be very well deserving of criticism. In particular, it appears from the publicly available accounts that the charity she runs is primarily for her own enrichment since she pays out almost all donations as her salary and personal expenses (she wasn’t attending the event at Buckingham Palace for her own charity work - she was there as someone else’s plus one), she has a history of denying help and even being abusive to domestic abuse victims on the grounds that they are mixed race rather than black, and she has previously publicly accused the royal family of domestic abuse against Meghan Markle without any evidence whatsoever (which raises obvious questions about whether she really attended the event in good faith in the first place).
First British person I ever met, in 1992, went on a half-hour long tirade about the "Pakis." The Pakis were disgusting, they were all criminals, etc. I thought, "What the hell is a Paki?" Turns out it was someone from Pakistan. The girl was a total, unabashed racist. The second British person I ever met was cool, though, so I figured maybe the racist was an outlier. Then I discovered the Daily Mail lol.
