So why don't we build homes for tornadoes? Up until recently the people who wrote the hazard books for buildings in the U.S never differentiated a tornado from straight line winds so local building codes only supported straight line winds. Last year was the first year tornadoes were mentioned and it was only for large commercial buildings that are more likely to get hit. Even for their guidelines it only covers tornadoes up to EF-2 strenh because even in the worst EF-5s maybe 1-3% of the damage is from EF-5 winds and that's probably an overestimate. So the goal is to protect buildings from the lagers EF-2 wind fields that exist in EF-5 and EF-4 tornadoes. It will be awhile before we see this in buildings codes for homes and of course anything already built won't live up to these standards unless you specifically built above the code in your area.
God! Lebanon isn't even a land neighbor of Turkey... I guess i still can't make sense of the disaster we went through because i was an earthquake victim. I'm crying all the time i have physical pain and endless fear in my heart.
Northwest Louisiana, so tornadoes and hurricane remnants. But now I'm in Pittsburgh, so I don't really know yet. There are occasional mild earthquakes in the northeast sometimes.
