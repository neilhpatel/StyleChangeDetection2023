What is your legal question? Was the gear left to you specifically in his will? Do you actually want to sue her over the cash value of the fishing gear?

NAL Not really sure what you are asking here - was there a will leaving this to you? If not then as his wife sheâ€™s entitled to do whatever she wants with his belongings without asking you.
