In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I do. Still, conservatives arbitrarily reject facts and data, so it's no surprise they continue on embracing their bigotry, cowardice, and incompetence.
Sure. And some, like AR15s, are incredibly easy to use and are far more efficient at killing, killing on a mass scale, and doing so rapidly than any other remotely accessible weapons (including handguns), short of planes and explosives.
No. I don't expect different results. Conservatives are too addicted to their bigotry, cowardice, and incompetence to let anything like integrity, compassion, or competency get in the way of their politics.
The only reason it doesn't work is the cowardice, bigoty, and incompetence that conservative ideology is founded upon.
Yep. All this “that’s not what we want” bullshit rhetoric we’ve heard since Uvalde just went out the window. Yes, yes it is what you want. You literally took a vote, counted it out, & decided “that’s exactly what we want”.
