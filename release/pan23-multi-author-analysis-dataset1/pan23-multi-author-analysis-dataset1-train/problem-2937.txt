“Everyone told I was daft to launch an invasion here, but I did it anyway… and it sank into the swamp. So I launched a second invasion… and that sank into the swamp. Then I launched a third invasion… that one burned down, fellow over, and then sank into the swamp…”.
With nearly 100,000 dead troops, thousands of tanks and armored vehicles destroyed, hundreds of aircraft and helicopters shot down, their Black Sea flagship sunk and the rest of the fleet cowering out of range of Ukrainian ASMs, wasting so many missiles and guided munitions trying to terrorize the populace with war crimes that they’re now having to modify old surface-to-air missiles to act as makeshift artillery rockets, their economy and supply chain so fucked that they’re having to loot various consumer electronics from Ukraine to salvage circuit boards from washing machines and the like for making new weapons, and with Ukraine receiving billions of dollars worth of arms from the West, and having had nearly a year to train tens of thousands of new troops, dig in defenses, coordinate their supply lines and command structure, and refine their war strategy?
Genius move. Attack to unprepared positions with professional army and with better equipment did not work, so lets attack again against positions that were prepared since spring with mobiks. What could go wrong?
The Axis powers managed to kill basically all their trained pilots (sort of proving my point by itself), to the point both Germany and Japan resorted to asking unskilled pilots to literally ram into things (Germany tried ramming bombers with very limited success but some survivors, Japan warships with more successes but less survivors).
Also, while maybe not reflective of the modern Russian airforce, it historically hasn’t been too difficult to convince pilots to undertake extremely dangerous missions.
