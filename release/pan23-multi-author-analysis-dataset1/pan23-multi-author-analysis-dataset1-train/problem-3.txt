In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Me too. Although I feel like this will be a 1944 kind of situation where we're pretty sure the VP is going to finish out the term. I mean I hope he lives long but my man is going to be almost 90 (over 90? I can't remember his exact age) by the time he leaves office.
Definitely not. The ACA has directly saved millions of lives and the Recovery and Reinvestment Act literally saved the economy. It's an absurd comparison.

Clinton was neoliberalism incarnate. The crime bill? Welfare to work policies? Repeal of Glass-Steagal? Facilitating the offshoring of factory jobs to increase American purchasing power rather than supporting union? Clinton was now where close to a transformative figure. Evidenced by the fact that Al Gore’s campaign, looking to continue the legacy of Clinton, was virtually indistinguishable from Bush’s.
