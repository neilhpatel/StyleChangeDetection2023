He is not wrong. As long as they are ruled by a dictator that is ruled by another dictator they will literally never be independent. They will keep living under russia's boot.
Note that this is not a rational criticism of American support for autocracies, because "a dictator that is ruled by another dictator" cannot apply when the US has a democratically elected government (even if you might fairly critique it as being too corporate). Thus, the unfortunate conclusion is that this is an example of "whataboutism", and a pretty weak attempt at whataboutism at that.
Yeah absolutely. Ukraine has had several victories that really caused Russia to lose a lot of material though, like capturing that logistics point Izyum(?), when they retook Kharkiv. They captured an absolute fuckton of Russian gear and vehicles there.
You’re being intentionally obtuse. Precedent is the result of litigation, usually a lot of it. Whataboutism is just you throwing shit out there to deflect attention from your own weak ass argument. When you catch your toddler doing something stupid and they say “But Tommy does it too!”, that’s whataboutism. Not an adult thing to do. It’s a particularly childish and low effort form of the red herring fallacy.
