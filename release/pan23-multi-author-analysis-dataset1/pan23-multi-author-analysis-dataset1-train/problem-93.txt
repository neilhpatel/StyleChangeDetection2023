The overall thesis of the book. Catlos is focusing on the relationships between Muslims, Christians, and Jews in this period and how regional and class concerns often transcended religious divides. It's a great antidote to a lot of pop culture depictions of the Crusading Period as being at its core a conflict of religions rather than a political conflict that featured a lot of religious people.
It does a lot of really great things, though, and it's definitely worth checking out if you're interested in the Crusades as a period rather than the narrative of the individual Crusades. Several of the things I really liked about it were:
Its historical sourcing is problematic (to say the least), but Mike Davis' Late Victorian Holocausts: El Nino Famines and the Making of the Third World is a thought provoking read about the relationship between colonialism and famine as seen through the lens of environmental history.
All the al-Andalus stuff. I don't really study this area, so it was great to get a high level discussion of the taifa kings period and early Almoravid period.
