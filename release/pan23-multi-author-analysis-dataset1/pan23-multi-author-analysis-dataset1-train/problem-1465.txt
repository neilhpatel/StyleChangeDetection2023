But, even if they did, the biggest advantage to this is not political. It is democratic (small "d"). At 16-17, they are more likely to have a stable address and family/school support to get required paperwork to register and get any needed voter ID or whatever. When your first election is 18-20, you may have moved out or be temporarily away from home (like at college) and less stable support structures to help navigate the forms and processes all with a massive change in circumstances.
So? 16 year olds are cognitive enough, hell make it 9 year olds, what difference does it make, we keep electing the same ol, same ol, farts and circle around the same ol, same ol issues year after year, after year with no resolve.

Earlier registration and habit forming should theoretically increase participation going forward. More people participating in the democratic process makes the republic stronger.
