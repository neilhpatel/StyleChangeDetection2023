But I simply disagree with the notion that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy here. The girlfriend hearing it while sitting in a common area, or while in their room is one thing, but standing in an area meant for egress (if that is the case here) while being close enough to the door, even holding the phone up to the door shows an extraordinary effort to listen to the therapy session.
Ahhh I see. I thought HIPPA covered a blanket of protection against any kind of health care intrusion, or privacy leak against individuals too, not just for you and the healthcare provider. Thanks for taking the time to explain that.
Under Maryland's Wiretap Act, it is unlawful to record any private in-person conversation or any telephone or electronic communication unless you are a party to the conversation and have the permission of all the other parties. Additionally, recording with criminal or tortious purpose is illegal, regardless of consent.
Is it really so cut-and-dry, though? I would argue that being in a closed room and having a private conversation would meet the requirements for an expectation of privacy when you take into account the fact that the girlfriend took extraordinary measures by standing at the door and listening in.
