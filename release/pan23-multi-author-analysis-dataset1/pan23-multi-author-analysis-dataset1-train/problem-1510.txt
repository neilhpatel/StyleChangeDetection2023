So….. then…. Russia invades… Russia, while… Poland invades Russia…. so, Russia….. is Poland invading Russia invading Poland? Well that’s good enough for me.
I've also seen redditors propose the idiotic idea that Ukraine should temporarily giving some of its ports to Moldavia or Romania to bypass the Russian blockade (this was before the Turkish grain shipping deal) ignoring the complicated history there (and the fact that a ton of Ukrainian grain was already being transported by land to Romania's main port without this sort of nonsense).
Yes. They wanted to “protect” Russian-speaking population (because apparently speaking Russian = being Russian; but not if you come from Asia).
Thanks. Only two people so far have taken it seriously but I'm a rather cold hearted lizard masquerading as a human and often accidentally say things that cross a line and wanted to get out ahead of things incase I did that here. I don't want to offend people I just struggle understanding what's acceptable at points.
