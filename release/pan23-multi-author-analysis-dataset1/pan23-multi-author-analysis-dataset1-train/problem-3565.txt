I feel dumb for asking this, but are fascists getting emboldened globally? I know we see them in the US but it's still a bad thing to be a fascist right? Or are they getting encouraged?
Discussions back then didn't deal with "liberal values", in the sense of gay rights or family values, it was all about economics and social control, and for those things, those on the far left proclaimed Russia could do no wrong as long as it opposed the imperialist USA and its crony allies.
Friend, I'm a spaniard. I have never, EVER seen anyone sympathetic to Russia. Left-wingers dont like Putin due to him being, well, Putin, and most right-wingers still have this stupid idea of "Russia is still communistist".
But Putin, the only time I've seen him be praised among fascists, it led to a very strange, very stupid discussion about him being a communist vs him being a christian vs him hating gays... it was a massive show of ignorance and stupidity.
Could be one with the encouragement/provisioning/funding by another. Russia has been known to take advantage of localized disruptive groups to further their agenda abroad.
