I don't have the right background to comment on the rest of the quote, but I can tackle this bit. While the author is on the right track with the assertion that disciplined infantry formations tend to hold their own against heavy cavalry, their understanding of the history of this military formation seems limited. Everything they're saying here about the Greeks is plainly wrong.
Looking at the 13th century, we find infantry working alongside cavalry in the three most important battles of the 1210s (Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, Steppes in 1213 and Bouvines in 1214), the Lombards once again withstanding the attack of cavalry - and this time archers as well - at Cortenuova in 1237, the militia of Strasbourg in 1262 acting offensively against cavalry and winning, the Guelph infantry annihilating the Ghibelline forces at Campaldino in 1289 and William Wallace's infantry holding firm against cavalry in the Battle of Falkrik in 1298.
What's the point of all this? Well, first to show that it's bad history to claim that the Greeks stood at the cradle of some general European or "Western" tradition of heavy infantry fighting. But also second, to show that military history is often much more complex, counterintuitive and contradictive than these simple summaries make it seem. The history of tactics is not a simple story of rock-paper-scissors, but a long history of different people responding to unique situations in ways that were limited by the social, economic, and political conditions in which they lived.
2. The "professional" infantry of the early Middle Ages were every bit the trained warriors as the later Medieval knights.
