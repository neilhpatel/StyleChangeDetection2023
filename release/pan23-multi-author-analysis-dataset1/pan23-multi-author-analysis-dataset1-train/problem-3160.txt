House Republicans have sought to remove Ms Omar for comments they consider antisemitic, for which Ms Omar apologised. But Democrats say that Republicans are engaging in Islamophobia.
Really? She raised money for him and got someone employed into his group, the FBI did the research, whoâ€™s not paying attention? You can support a philosophy of a party and still want to hold people accountable. This is the problem with the state of politics, people only seem to want accountability for the other team not their team. Standards should be kept for everyone.
Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York delivered an impassioned speech defending Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota as Republicans seek to remove Ms Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Is this what she got in trouble for? That's kinda dumb. You can read it as if it's antisemitic or you can read it as simply referring to pro-Israel lobbyists. I suppose it's nebulous enough that you can't really know what she meant, but I don't like the idea that someone has to apologize for something that had zero racist intent because someone else felt like it did. I know I wasn't being racist and if you thought I was, well that's your problem.
