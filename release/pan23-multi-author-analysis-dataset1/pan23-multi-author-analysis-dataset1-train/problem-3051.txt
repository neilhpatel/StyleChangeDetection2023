Random plug for RedReader. It got mentioned in a thread similar to this about a year ago, it's by far the best Reddit app in my opinion. Minimal UI, but with a lot of options for how you want to customize. Check it out .
For the moment, this feature has been rolled back so we aren't going to be doing anything immediately, but we of course will consider wider coordinated protests if it comes back without the kind of implementations that we are asking for, namely subreddits having the option to opt-out before it is rolled out.
I'm glad too. I think it was possibly less due to the outrage of subs like this, and more the likelihood of abuse on subs offering support for sexual abuse, suicide, and the like that forced the admins' hands, but all the voices helped. Respect to the AskHistorians mods for taking such a principled stance.
"Admins" = Reddit administration. They own and operate the website, support the software, and have admin-level powers (including shadow-bans, full banning from Reddit, deleting any comment or subreddit, etc). So in this case, they came up with a new feature, and slapped it on half of the subreddits.
