However, this is a fairly recent phenomenon. The 19th Century would see a rise in nationalism that is often attributed to (or at least claimed to have been started around the time of) the French Revolution. Political consciousness among the masses became increasingly common, leading to calls for unification areas like Germany and Italy and independence in places like Ireland and much of the Habsburg monarchy. Prior to this nationalism, States didn't necessarily care about the social identities of the peoples they governed, and the legitimacy of a State, its policies, and its borders was reliant on other factors that varied with location and era. In the early and high middle ages, for example, the concept of Christendom and Papal authority was considered a chief source of legitimacy among Christian peoples, far outshining any local identities. Personal relationships between ruling elites providing legitimacy and power were another staple of Medieval Europe, especially in the early Carolingian Empire. Later on, as local identities began to form, special privileges took hold in many areas (though not necessarily as a result of the unique identity), but these separate identities themselves were rarely the cause of attempts for self-governance.
What a phenomenal post. There am I am, linking your wonderful post from earlier just as a quick qualifier, not expecting that you'd chime in and systematically dismantle some often repeated lost cause-isms!
