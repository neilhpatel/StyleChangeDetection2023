>The police may deny an application for a permit only in exceptional cases. If you have been granted a permit for a public gathering, the police are responsible for ensuring that you can implement it and that the public can take part in it. This does not mean that a public gathering may be held in any place, whatsoever, or at any time. The right to meet and demonstrate may be limited, but only if the limitation is necessary. For example, when two demonstrations are to take place in close proximity and the police make the determination that a risk exists that the demonstrators may confront each other, one of the demonstrations may be moved to a different location. The Public Order Act contains provisions regarding when the police are entitled to cancel or disperse a public gathering. The reason can be that doing so is necessary for the sake of order and safety.
