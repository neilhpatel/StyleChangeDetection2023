Some of their cities has a population from 10-25mil. With Shanghai (The highest) at 27milion people.
They have completely unvaccinated population, have absolutely minimal previous immunity, horrible hygienic conditions in many places like wet markets, and apparently they just reopened absolutely everything at once with no control and no thought, and positive people are apparently now being forced to work as if they weren't.
Yes. They tried vaccine mandates, aka forced vaccines. But people protested that so they trashed it.
Canâ€™t really do gradual reopening when infections were already exploding during lock down, this was just them acknowledging it because the costs of locking down more were becoming too high, and business as usual was no longer enough to stop exponential growth.
And? Bloomberg is an unbiased and rationally reporting organization which couldn't possibly have a motive for distorting reality beyond any means of possibility?
Yes but with what? Their vaccines weren't even effective against original strain. I call Chinese population unvaccinated, because it effectively is.
They have cities with a bigger population than some European countries have people... And that is just ONE city.
