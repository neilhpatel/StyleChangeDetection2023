Pay the taxes. Pay the insurance. If the taxes aren't paid, the County (city, cemetery district, township, whatever, taxes are typically collected by Counties) will foreclose. If the insurance isn't paid, fire, tornado, etc. may claim the house.
The insurance company can't just unilaterally cancel the policy because the policy holder is nuisance. They have a handful of possible ways out of a policy: They can refuse to renew it, they can cancel is after a claim has been processed, or they can start the process of cancellation (might take a while though) if the premium isn't paid.
Absolutely true. But OP should cover their ass while exploring a civil case to eventually be able to “evict” their sister. Because while they both own it, neither could legally evict the other and both are financially responsible. The rest of the world doesn’t care about their agreement.
This is attorney territory— real estate attorney territory, specifically. The stuff your sister is doing is legal gibberish but you both will lose the house if you don’t keep up with taxes, etc.
