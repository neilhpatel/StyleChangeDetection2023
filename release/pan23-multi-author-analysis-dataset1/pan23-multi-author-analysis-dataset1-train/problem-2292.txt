For the sake of simplicity I'm going to assume that you and your victim are both free (slavery was still around legally for at least 5 more years in England) able bodied men engaged in some local craft. So you've killed someone, left the body in the streets, and made it back to your dwelling seemingly undetected, what happens next? Well obviously someone will find the body in the morning and report it to a local authority. Who would that be?
Also I just wanted to add, for fun, that I read the other day about how Rome (completely different time and size of city) had such a problem with traffic jams during the day that businesses were only allowed to ship goods at night. Nice to know my commute is an age old problem.
Penance could be a lot of different things depending on the crime, it could be as simple as a period of time fasting (and donating money and not taking up arms) all the way up through "perpetual pilgrimage" (aka exile) in a murder case with few if any extenuating circumstances though this likely wouldn't be an avenue for restitution.
Great answer by u/idjet. And a very in-depth discussion follows upon that, which idjet (an inaptronym if I've ever seen one) contributes to. Bravo, y'all.
This could be something like a monetary payment, dependent on the social status of the person you killed, and an agreement to undergo penance as well as swearing an oath to not pursue the matter further or try to take further violent action.
