China would not appreciate the fact that their rivals now had a deterrent that can’t really be defeated but I think the balance of power in the region would settle rather quickly. It’s doubtful any of these nations would consider war with one another if they were all nuclear-armed unless state leadership felt like it was their last option.
One could make the argument that mutually assured destruction could end most warfare between states if most or all were armed with a nuclear deterrent. One could also argue the odds of an incident sparking off a global armageddon would also increase the more states possessed these weapons. I think with climate change difficulties on the horizon and many developed nations in a sort of late-stage capitalism, US allies are likely anticipating a future where they may no longer be able to find space under the U.S. nuclear umbrella which is why they are developing their own.
Ugh gods. That thing gives me the absolute worst anxiety of my life and I can't get away from it. Its something that has weirdly enough given me the worst depression as well. Worst clock.
"... the NPT non-nuclear-weapon states agree never to acquire nuclear weapons and the NPT nuclear-weapon states in exchange agree to share the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology and to pursue nuclear disarmament aimed at the ultimate elimination of their nuclear arsenals.".
