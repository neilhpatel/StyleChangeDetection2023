This is not to say, however, that lines were the only thing used by the British. Indeed, skirmishing was a very real thing, but the thing about skirmishers is that they are only very effective if they are armed with a rifle (which did exist at the time, though they were impractical to issue to the average soldier) and are well-trained in its usage, as well as being well-trained in the usage of skirmish tactics.
Essentially, by having multiple ranks drilled in firing techniques (firing, kneeling, and loading for the men in the front, firing and loading for the men in the back), you could keep up a somewhat continuous pace of fire, which was extremely useful in keeping the enemy suppressed and inflicting the maximum amount of casualties in the shortest period of time.
Ah, I see the confusion I had relating to this, thanks for clarifying! In the 1907 version the wording was changed to " (e) To employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering;" which I had seen before, and it was mentioned that after WWI the connection was drawn between using serrated knives as weapons and that Article 23 (e) wording, about unnecessary suffering.
Not to mention, discipline was a factor. If you feel confident that there are men all around you fighting just the same way as you are - as in, you are not fighting alone - you are generally going to be less likely to break in the face of losses or some intimidating enemy action, such as a cavalry charge.
As like you mention, "superflous" is a bit vague. I think this one more appropriately calls it out, as serrated knives (used as weapons not for utility) make it extremely hard for a wound to close up.
