These two factors also intersect, and a good example of this is Basil II of the Byzantine Empire. Basil played a highly active role in the military campaigns of his age, which allowed him to build up his own military prestige. At the same time, there were simply too many problems for him to deal with personally. If he was campaigning in Bulgaria, and Arab raiders attacked Anatolia, he could delegate a military commander to respond. In this case, Basil tended to take on the largest campaigns and challenges himself, while still delegating as much as was feasible for him. Hope this helps!
This was convenient in one way: if the emperor was always commanding the field army, whoever was defending the opposite side of the empire probably didn't have the resources to cause a ton of trouble (not that they didn't try on occasion.).
When is a difficult question, because to a certain extent, even as far back as Antiquity we have societies where leaders absented themselves from both combat and even behind the lines battle command, while there's also have the former President of Chad, Idriss DÃ©by dying in combat against rebels in April of 2021 supposedly from gunshot wounds. However, as for why, I can provide two reasons for monarchs: the need for military legitimacy, and the scale of the war effort.
Additionally, the more wars are fought and the farther they're fought from home makes them more difficult for a monarch to personally command. The tetrarchy of Diocletian was a means of making sure there was imperial authority in all of the Empire's crisis zones, so that the response in each region could be fast and effective, and not be slowed down by the need to wait on official instructions from the Emperor. Napoleon led his own armies, but had a group of Marshals to which he could delegate important military commands. As brilliant a commander as Napoleon was, he couldn't fight in Central Europe while also putting down a revolt in Spain.
