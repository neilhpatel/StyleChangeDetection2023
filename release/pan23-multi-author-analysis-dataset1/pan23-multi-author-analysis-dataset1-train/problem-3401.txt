'Native' was the most common term used by the British to describe all the groups. While they didn't exclusively use it in a pejorative sense, this was common - calling someone a native was loaded with an accusation of barbarism, savagery, and lack of civilization. Most famously expressed in the phrase "to go native", which was most certainly a criticism. Equally important for the historian, using a catch-all term like native leads to stereotyping and the classifying as numerous ethnic groups as a single entity when in reality ethnic groups living in even close proximity to each other can have very different motivations, political and economic systems, and even religion and language (mostly ignored by colonising forces who simply saw them as natives in 'tribes' - tribe itself also very often being a colonial invention). So historians must always try to stay clear of this stereotypical language or else it will limit their intellectual investigation and may inadvertently replicate these stereotypes.
No, sorry. I hunted up my source for that information. I found it in Bergerud's book Touched With Fire. He writes "Likewise on the island of Bougainville, the Japanese Army and many indigenous peoples were at war with each other late in the conflict." It's not footnoted, so I don't know the source.
