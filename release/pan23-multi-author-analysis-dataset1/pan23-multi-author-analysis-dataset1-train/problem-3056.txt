You cannot bill your spouse in a divorce for cleaning a house. There are ways to contribute to a marriage though. Anyone here is going to have 3-4 pieces of information, while her attorney is going to have 300-400 and can give better advice, obviously. But make sure it's HER attorney, not his. She should not take any advice or instructions from someone else's attorney.
She just needs to listen to the attorney. We can't know what the attorney knows about the entirety of their finances. But to be clear, she's married, her husband inherited money, you took it and bought a cabin, and now your mother is getting divorced? For the other house, what do you mean "inherited from his name" whose name? From or to whom? While Texas is a community property state, inheritances are generally not considered community property. Is that the issue?
Typically in a community property state any assets purchased with separate property remain separate property even during a marriage. Inheritance is separate property.
How about that he was a horder and that for a year my mom was here everyday cleaning it and making it livable. Would she be able to bill him or would she beable to get some kind of right over it?
Inherited assets aren't normally community property. They would be his own personal, separate, property. Same goes for things (e.g., houses) acquired with those assets.
