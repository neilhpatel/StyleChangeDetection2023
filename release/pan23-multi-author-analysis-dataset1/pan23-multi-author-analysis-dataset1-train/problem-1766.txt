Can you get access to the bank records from around the time of the lease signing / beginning of the rental? You could look for a deposit matching the rough amount (typical security deposits are anywhere from a few hundred to one or two months worth of rent—so if rent was say a thousand a $3000 deposit could be the first+last+security.
THANK YOU. This is so helpful, especially the Florida link at the bottom. You answered a lot of my questions, as I’ve only been the renter in the past. Thank you again.
Ok, thank you. We don’t have an executor, the advise at the time was that we didn’t need one because there was only one asset and it was being taken over by my brother. It’s going to be complicated because he was a resident of another state when he died (MS). Thank you for all of the advice.
Your dad’s estate owes them the deposit minus damages back—if there’s no cash in the estate you may need to sell the property to get the funds to satisfy the debt, or you / you and the other heirs could pay put the debt (sec dept minus damages) to them directly to make sure the house doesn’t need to get sold. You definitely wouldn’t need to give them back the first or last month rent though—first month clearly went towards the first month they rented and last month is being used now to cover their notice period (though they wouldn’t be responsible for giving you rent money now since they paid for that as a last month up front). Also, this is assuming they did actually do last month up front—see if there was any documentation.
