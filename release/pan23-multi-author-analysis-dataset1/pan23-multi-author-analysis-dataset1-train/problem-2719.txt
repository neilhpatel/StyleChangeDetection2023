Subsidies in this context don't fix the problem, for the same reason rent controlled housing doesn't fix high rent prices, and the same reason why price caps on goods don't work (see the price caps that were attempted by Nixon on oil). When you cap a market dictated price, it just creates an imbalance in the supply and demand equation, where you create too much demand for a given level of supply. Prices should largely be determined by supply. Obviously bad actors can collude to move prices, such as oil and gas playing with prices around election day. But in this context, subsidizing fertilizer will only make things worse.

It’s economics based on nothing but empty conjecture and promises and has never, since it’s conception, delivered on its promises because Austrian Economics is a cruel hoax that began with Von Hayek, (which was bad enough) but then degenerated into Ayn Rand’s permanently pubescent Objectivism.
