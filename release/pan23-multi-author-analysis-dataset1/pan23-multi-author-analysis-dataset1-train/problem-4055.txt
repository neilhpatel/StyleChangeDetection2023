Yes. As I was agreeing with the previous comment the real issue is that they have a binding agreement and by emailing the DocuSign link for signature would be a colorable argument that the landlord is agreeing to the terms by sending the document out for signature. The signature is just a technical defect, because there was already a meeting of the minds. There wasn’t anything detailed “hey your lease is contingent on landlord getting refinanced” but worse case OP can go to small claims court or justice court and get a judgment for either specific performance (forcing landlord to sign) or small declaratory relief (declaring new lease valid) Many states allow small claims/limited court/justice allow for declaratory judgment or specific performance on these small contractual matters. I can’t speak to Texas if Justice of the Peace court could offer one or the other or both, but justice court would be the next step if small claims wouldn’t work which is for another court on another day but it doesn’t change the nature of filing the both leases and maybe add the DocuSign email too and file as the whole enchilada. (Now I’m getting hungry).
As to the LL not signing the new lease: Assuming each of you changed no terms in the new lease presented to you and simply signed it, then there is a very good chance that you have a valid contract with him that a court would force him or his successor to perform upon. Even though he didn't sign, it was his terms which you and your roommate each unilaterally agreed to.
