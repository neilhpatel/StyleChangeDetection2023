1. While Georgia did have relatively large numbers of Jews in its early years, relatively is a key word here. There weren't more than 1k-2k Jews in the entirety of the 13 Colonies, divided between a bunch of states (New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Georgia, for the most part). About 40-some-odd Jews arrived in Georgia in 1733, upon the founding of the colony, but that was a large percentage of the colony- about a third- without being an actually large number.
Here's the story- the William and Sarah, the second ship to land in Georgia upon the founding of the colony in 1733, included 40 or so Jews, a mix of Portuguese and Central European Jews. (One of the Central European Jewish families in the group, the Minises, ended up bringing into the world the first European child born in Georgia, Philip/Uri.) Upon its arrival, the trustees of the colony in London, who had banned Catholics from the colony but hadn't even considered the idea that there might be Jews (despite the fact that the Portuguese Sefardic Jews of the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London had been donors to the endeavor of establishing the colony, precisely in the hopes that it could become a hospitable place for Jewish settlement), were furious that Jews had landed and demanded that the governor, James Oglethorpe, revoke the permission of these Jews to settle there.
This is all very very fascinating, thank you for the answer. I asked this question because on a recent trip to Savannah we saw a giant cathedral-like building, only to learn it’s in fact a functioning synagogue.
The tour guide said the only architect around had only ever designed churches, so if not for the Jewish star atop the doors we’d have never known it was a temple. The tour guide said the Star of David was a more recent tradition, which make sense in my mind.
