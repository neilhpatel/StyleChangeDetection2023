If this is not the first time you have been to court with ex2 and it’s a modification situation then those documents you received two months ago will not address that issue as child support and visitation are considered separate issues. You will need to either request the original establishment order that addresses the possession and access from the OAG or you can contact the district clerk to pull those documents related to your case (most likely at a cost). Hope this helps.
My BIL let his ex dictate custody when they first divorced, a few years later he went back to court and asked for more visitation - the judge ended up switching primary custody to him and giving the mom summers and alternating school breaks. Ask for the visitation you want, if you want her week on/week off, ask for it. There are a lot of ways to split custody, before you go to court you should look them up and find the schedule you think will benefit you and your daughter the most. Good luck!
We’ve been to court 2 months ago for child support, I have received those documents that just state how much I am going to be paying each month but it doesn’t say anything about visitation. In the hearing my ex was asked if we follow any kind of visitation and I do remember my ex saying we don’t follow any court order that it’s more so just “first come first serve” on who gets our daughter, but I don’t know if she was saying there’s no order in place at all or if we just don’t follow one if there is. A visitation order was never mentioned after that, the judge didn’t say anything regarding 1st, 3rd, and 5th weekends but then again we weren’t there for visitation order, just the child support order.
