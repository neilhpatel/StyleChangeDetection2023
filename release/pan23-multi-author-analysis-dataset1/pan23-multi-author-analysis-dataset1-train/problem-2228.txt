It's absolutely incredible that this race is as close as it is. It goes to show you the level of depravity and ignorance that a man who is been called out for his brazen stupidity and that every time he opens his mouth he makes Trump look like an IQ genius. A man who is repeatedly lied about his position on abortions having a number of women that he forced to have abortions, a man who has lied about where he lives and his domicile is in Texas and yet he's claiming he's from Georgia. A man who's lied about being a successful businessman while he uses free convict labor and threats of going back to prison the staff his businesses. A man who like Donald Trump has broken many laws, lies about being a police officer, lies about his education, and the list goes on and on. This man is tied with a preacher who's demonstrated in the very short time that he's wise knows how to work across the aisle and get things done for the citizens of Georgia. This should be an 80/20 race with Warnock running away with it and yet he's tied. It's incredible.
It is the south and Warnock supported unpopular issues. It is an entirely predictable outcome. People like their guns, and what did Biden do right before voting began? Said he was going to ban them.
