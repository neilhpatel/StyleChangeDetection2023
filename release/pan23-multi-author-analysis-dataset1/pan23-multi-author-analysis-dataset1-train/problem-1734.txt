Vancouver has these as well. You have to have a history of failed rehab attempts I believe though. Which honestly is ok but there are functional addicts out there who have never gone to rehab but could seriously benefit from safe and cheap lab grade product. Opioids are one of the only drugs that don't cause organ damage or toxicity on their own. Its using dirty needles or getting a bad batch that is dangerous. There is a risk of constipation though if you don't watch your diet which can lead to problems if left out of control.
Hey, I got no problem with decriminalizing drugs but Vancouver basically decriminalizes everything.
2.) Funny, because in all the states that have legalized marijuana, the illicit market is still thriving. The drug cartels are more powerful and violent than ever. And this is completely ignoring the fact that the cartels have diversified far beyond simple narcotics and would not go away even if cocaine or heroin disappeared tomorrow.
Yep. Public use of hard drugs should absolutely be illegal, but have the sentence be public funded rehab.
