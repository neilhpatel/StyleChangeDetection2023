Thank you very much for this, Fish. I really appreciate the insight. But can you speak to the exact scenario he has in mind, where he says to the CEO something like - "You did something bad to me, and you pretend your workers are a family, and I think they have a right to know exactly what you did to me. But if you're reasonable and fair and give me a couple months severance - which is only fair - while I look for a job, then I'm not going to think that you did a bad thing to me I'll think you treated me fairly I'll tell coworkers who are asking that you treated me fair - because it will be the truth. Not because I'm threatening you. I'm going to tell coworkers how you treated me either way. You have a chance to treat me well or treat me poorly.".
Demanding three months of pay after only spending three months at the job is so disconnected from any claim of right (it's so absurd an amount of money related to the amount of time that he spent at the company) that I think it's likely he could be charged for blackmail/extortion.
Right? That's the only thing the company has to offer, it's the only reason we work. You wouldn't go to your job if it didn't pay, right? So you go there for money. Well, the company can treat him shitty - like how they have, at least so far. Or they can treat him fair. Yes, by giving him money The very thing employers give to employees Him, me, and you. What else can they do to make things better for him? Send him a sympathy card?
If he chooses to do so, he should probably keep things strictly facts that aren't up for debate and things that relate to his perspective, so as not to open himself up to defamation claims ("I was terminated on this date and, to my knowledge, had no performance issues. I feel that I was treated unfairly.").
