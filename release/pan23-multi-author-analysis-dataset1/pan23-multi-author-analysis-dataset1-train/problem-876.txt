I worked in a Disability Services Office at a University. It’s standard procedure in many universities to approach the student disability office to get a waiver as an accommodation, so long as it is not critical to the degree (i.e. waiver French for a French degree) and the documentation supports it. Many schools will not usually provide a waiver for ADD/ADHD. ADA requires case-by-case consideration, though.
That’s what I was thinking. My advisor told me to take this route even though I told him about the medical docs and disability diagnosis, so I’m a bit concerned that the disability department wouldn’t be about to override since I wasn’t directly referred to them. Fingers crossed though.
If you fundamentally disagree with their decision and feel your rights have been violated, then you can file a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights in the Federal Department of Education. They can look into into the case and determine if the University violated the ADA or section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Complaining does not mean the feds will automatically side with you. It’s all based on court precedents and Dept. of Ed determination.
