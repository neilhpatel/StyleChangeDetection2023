In general, European folk belief maintained that being able to transform into a wolf was strictly part of the male domain. Women were associated with the phenomenon, but only through witchcraft - and they themselves were generally not perceived as being able to transform into wolves. In fact, European folk belief generally maintained that werewolves were cursed into involuntarily transforming because their mothers had used witchcraft to avoid the pain of childbirth: the resulting child periodically became a werewolf (as an adult) if it were a boy, and if a girl, she was cursed by becoming a mare - tormenting young men with nightmares. So, according to folk belief, women were practically excluded from the idea of transforming into wolves, because the curse that caused the condition manifested differently for men and women.
