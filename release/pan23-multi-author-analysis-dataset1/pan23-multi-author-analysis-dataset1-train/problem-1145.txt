While the outnumbered Soviet forces in Stalingrad fought hard to slow the Germans, and to keep their precarious toehold in the city, the forces noted above - over a third of a million men and 1000 tanks which had been kept out of Stalingrad - punched through the weak Romanian armies on the German flanks and trapped the bulk of the German 6th Army in Stalingrad. While the Germans had committed themselves to a grinding battle of attrition in Stalingrad, the Soviets had the vision to aim for a bigger prize. Rather than simply defend Stalingrad, they opted to leave Stalingrad weak, and lured more and more German forces in. They then sprung the trap, and caught the German 6th Army. This operation (Operation Uranus) demonstrated the growing strenh and skill of the Red Army, and the vision of Soviet high command. The Germans had been thoroughly out-Blitzkrieged.
Interesting! Do you have any idea how Romanian armies fared on the eastern front? Smaller nations like it in my mind would be easily swept yet I mainly admit my ignorance towards those parts of WW2â€™s history.
