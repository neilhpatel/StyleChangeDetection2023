We had a similar demonstration in the last few years: a small piece of forest (Hambach), which had been steadily felled over two decades (I grew up there, so Pepperidge Farm remembers when it was still a real forest) was to be felled so the mine could expand to its planned limits. These guys showed up and suddenly everyone pretended that those few hundred meters of forest was mightily important and had to be protected - when in the preceding decades no one gave a shit and the little rest of a forest was barely enough to be considered a system.
It's mainly not about where, but that the coal is mined. Any coal which we mine will be used, and therefore damage the climate further.
Absolute bullshit. You will always need a base load; a task renewables simply can't fill. Moreover, Germany ,of%20wind%20and%20solar%20power) renewable energy, so it's hypocritical to single out nuclear energy in that regard.
So what was the plan again? They never and still don't lay out a plan for the energy storage problem at scale, and before you don't solve that you can't only use renewables.
