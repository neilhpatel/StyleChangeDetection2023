Thanks for the kind words and for your question. I publish - without sufficient imagination to claim otherwise - as Ronald M James. . I've published with 7 publishers, so it would be tedious to list each individually. My recent book on folklore, (2018) is too expensive, but it will be released as a paperback early next year - that's good news. I also offer my , which I developed as I taught folklore for over three decades - and I offer it as I did for my students at the lowest of possible prices - to cover printing, etc. You may find use in that.
Swedish histography even had a famous schism about it centred around Lauritz Weibull (1873-1960) when he was to be installed as professor of history at the university of Lund in 1919. The controversy centred around a work he published in 1911 "Critical investigations in the history of the Nordic region around the year 1000" which basically introduced modern critical evaluation of sources and basically as his opponents saw it, threw away all of the established history.
Thank you so much for sharing these! I am very interested in folklore, myths, and legends, both personally and how to incorporate it into my writing. I look forward to reading your stuff .
Historical legends - like legends in general - are persistently and insidiously believable. The very process of repeated oral tradition acts like the flow of a river or the pounding of the sea's surf, rounding the rough edges of rocks. This can make the fanciful seem believable, and it is easy to make it indistinguishable from "the facts." That's a reason why it is easy to understand how the legendary became integrated into histories written in the past, but the process is by no means ended.
