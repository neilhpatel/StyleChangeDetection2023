But it can get worse. We have to live sustainably. Even if we want to just maintain 2.0 or 2.5 degrees of warming, we have to fully embrace sustainability and green energy as the backbone of our way of life. 3 and 4 degrees of warming cannot be prepared for in any meaningful way. No semblance of modern society and all the benefits of living in a technologically advanced civilization can be maintained by small enclaves of people living in climate hell.
How do we get the ice to float? Displace the equivalent mass in water. How much volume should that be? From above, at the density of water, it needs to displace 100 volume units. That leaves 10 volume units of the ice remaining visible above the surface.
Yes, an iceberg is partially submerged and partially above the water. That is because ice is less dense than water.
Now, let’s freeze that water. We still have 100 mass units but let’s say ice has a density ratio of 0.9 because we know it is less dense. So we have approximately 110 volume units to use round numbers.
