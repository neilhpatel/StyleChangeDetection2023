Nobody thinks you are (okay, maybe the person you're responding to is, but in general...). But we still remember the talk of potentially swapping MiG-29s for F-35s. Trading out the aged 80s hardware for something from this millennia. It didn't happen but it was a huge debate for months.
If Russia used nuclear weapons in Ukraine (they won't, because it doesn't fit their strategic goals, but just to satisfy a 'what if'), there would be a large conventional response by a US led coalition (not NATO itself, but of 'willing partners') against all Russian assets not inside the borders of Russia and Russia would be sanctioned to the point that their only trade partners would be, maybe, China.
Side note. We went to dinner in Narvick, and they sold t shirts that read, "Save the Whales, for Dinner".
The F35 is the most technologically advanced jet ever made, a little bit more advanced in terms of electronics than the currently updated f22, much more advanced than the SU57 (the best Russian stealth plane, of which only 21 were ever built) and astronomically ahead of basically every other plane on earth.
NATO isn't involved because 1. It is a defensive alliance and no NATO countries are under attack and 2. It can damage Russia with no chance of retaliation by ensuring that Ukraine has superior equipment and intelligence.
