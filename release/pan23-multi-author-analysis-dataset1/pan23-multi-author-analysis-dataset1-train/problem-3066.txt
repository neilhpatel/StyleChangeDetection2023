That's a hard no. Don't get me wrong, I hate Nazis, but once you start giving partisan politicians the power to limit speech based on highly subjective notions of what constitutes "hate", now you're opening the door for the GOP to start outlawing speech that offends conservatives, or speech that is critical of Republican politicians.
