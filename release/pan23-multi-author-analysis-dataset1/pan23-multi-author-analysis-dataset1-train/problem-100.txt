In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Are you any of these? If so, then don't be so surprised that I, and I suspect most people, aren't so sympathetic to your "plight".

It looks to somewhat mirror the situation that already occurs if a high net worth person renounces their US citizenship or non-citizen residency - they can stop accruing new US tax obligations by doing that, but first they have to pay taxes on the appreciation in value that occurred while they were a citizen or resident (in effect the taxes that would be due if they sold the assets they day they left the US tax system). There's a high minimum before that kicks in though.
