Oh, and it’s also possible that the other party won’t even show. Make sure you ask for a declaratory judgment and then an enforcement order for a garnishment of wages, as they’ve proven incapable of repayment on their own (this is going to really put a nail in the coffin of your friendship). If granted, the court notified your friend’s employer of the garnishment and a certain portion of their paycheck will be made directly to you.
Yes, if the court is the intermediary (and I’m not sure if Wisconsin does this for small claims actions - you can ask the Clerk when you file), they receive payment from the debtor and pass it to you.
It’s possible the judge is simply going to enforce the payment schedule… you can ask the court if they act as an intermediary so that there’s documentation if they continue to miss payments.
Sounds good, thanks for the tips! I was not sure how much “reasoning” or backstory judges look for rather than straight up what is legally right or wrong when determining a judgement. I’ll present just the facts of the financial aspects and leave the rest in case it does come up.
