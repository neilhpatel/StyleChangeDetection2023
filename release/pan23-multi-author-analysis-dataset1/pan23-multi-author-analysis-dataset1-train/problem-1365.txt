Physchy, if you’re a contractor, but working via W2, they should be actually using the 1099 form for your taxes. If you’re a W2 employee paying a payroll tax, the employer on a 10 hr work day is required to offer you 2 paid breaks no less than 10 min, and no greater than 15 min, and an unpaid 30 min lunch break. Hours of operation are discretionary to the function of the business, and without a drastic change in hours of business, finding a legal basis to stand on is almost impossible. If you’re a contractor getting a W2, than I’d recommend finding a new gig as the employer can’t even handle the simplest of legal/ formal employment docs. If you’re a 1099 contractor, than you have the legal authority to set your own break/lunch durations. Once again, if they don’t understand that, reason number two for finding a new gig presents itself. Either way, find a gig that makes you semi happy to wake up in the morning, and keep grinding till you find that place. Makes life happier.
Definitely this. Odds are the terms of their contract are being violated. Contracting firms only product is their people. Keep your records, call your agency. Give them a “short “ chance to unscrew you.
