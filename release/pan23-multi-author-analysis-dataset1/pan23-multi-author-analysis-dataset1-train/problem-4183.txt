The decree doesn’t have anything in regards to when we don’t agree. I’ve already reached out to a lawyer on this. He’s going too far on this in my opinion, I’m a pretty lenient person when it comes to his ridiculous thoughts but I’m not about to put my children at risk because of some misinformation he’s received on the internet from someone with a HS Diploma. I told him that I’m basing my opinion on the opinion of the pediatrician him and I picked out together, the same doctor that took care of him his entire childhood, and if he wants to put politics in front of his own children’s health, that’s his problem, but this is the hill I’ll die on, I’d rather a pissed off ex husband than a dead child any day..
What about a tie-breaker? "Together" when things are 50/50 is unworkable, as in theory the child could never get medical attention, all it would take is one parent to say "no" and that would cancel any medical care. Hypothetically.
The world’s rarest coffee, Kopi Luwak, comes from Indonesia where a wildcat known as the luwak lives. The cat eats coffee berries and the coffee beans inside pass through the stomach. The beans are harvested from the cat’s dung heaps and then cleaned and roasted. Kopi Luwak sells for about $500 for a 450 g (1 lb) bag.
Routine, everyday decisions: Each parent can make all routine, everyday educational and medical decisions for the minor child(ren) while he/she is with that parent, including administering minor first aid or over-the-counter medicine.
In theory what he could do is to take you to court for contempt. One would imagine that the judge would consider this a waste of time. You can talk to your attorney first, but ultimately there should be a way that this isn't a problem.
