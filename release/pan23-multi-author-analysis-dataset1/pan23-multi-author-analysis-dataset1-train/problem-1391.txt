"The IRS Whistleblower Program guarantees to the whistleblower at least 15%, and up to 30%, of government tax collections that result from the whistleblowerâ€™s reporting to the IRS, to the extent those recoveries exceed $2 million.
Untrue. Payroll taxes or lack thereof doesn't preclude employment. In other words, while paid payroll taxes are a good proof of employment, lack of paid taxes mean there's no employment. Work was performed, and worker was paid, so it is employment. You just find alternative ways to prove it. These gift cards are a proof. Any written communication with employer is a proof. Any pictures taken at work are a proof. A list of names of coworkers is a proof. Everything helps.
No reward is paid to the whistleblower until the IRS actually collects the taxes, penalties and interest owed, and all the statutory periods for a taxpayer to file a claim for a refund has expired.".
If you're worried about being fired, as most states allow for at-will employment, and thus those employees can be fired without cause, meaning no reason needs to be stated, you could blame your parent or guardian and say hey, I can't get paid like this because so and so complained and wants to be sure I can access actual cash at any point. Or say so for yourself. You need access to the cash for the hours you've worked. Whether you get direct deposit, a paper check or an envelope full of cash- you should have access to those funds for immediate withdrawal (subject to your bank of course), and fully confident that your tax liability is being met each time as well as his own.
