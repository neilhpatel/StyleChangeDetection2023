And probably more inadequate & inappropriate substitutions. Things like more of using S-300 AA systems as air to ground missiles, or using tanks as lobbing pseudo-artillery.

Oh the older Kh-55s turned to be a disaster. Initial launch in this war made about 40% of them unable to even enter the programmed path. As for fuel - they are using aviation kerosene and are fueled before the mission. However, as for example a car that stays long term parked somewhere, they need an occasional checkup and maintenance.
