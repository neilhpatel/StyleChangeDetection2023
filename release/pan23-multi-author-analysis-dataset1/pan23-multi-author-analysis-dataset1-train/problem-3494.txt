We still had air raid sirens and monthly tests in socal in the early 70s. One literally across the street from my bedroom. By the time I was ten you just ignored them.
It isn't imperialistic though. Moldova is Romania, in the same way Wallachia is Romania. Moldovans, Transylvanians, and Wallachians are all Romanians. My entire family is from Romania. My mother is Moldovan, just because she is from the Moldova that is still part of Romania it doesn't make her any less Moldovan. Her parents were Moldovan before Bessarabia was stolen by the Russians, does that make them any less Moldovan?
Exactly. I'd hate to have been in any of their positions but I don't feel like their official reasoning is the real one. There's certainly a lot more going on under he surface.
Unification is not really an easy matter for instance how do you handle Gagauzia as an autonomous enclave when the Romanian constitution doesn't allow ethnic minority regions to have autonomous government.
Oh yeah, we had the weekly ones in elementary. It just felt weird that even after the tests went to monthly and then eventually stopped that ugly yellow thing hung on the telephone pole across the street.
Moldovans are literally Romanians. Romania is the union of the Principality of Wallachia and Moldova. Formed during the spring of nations period to be the nation of the Romanian people. Moldovans are Romanian.
People from Moldova are called Romanians because they are literally Romanians. Romania was formed by the union of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldova. It is the nation of the Romanian people and Moldovan's are a Romanian people.
There is no reason to form a Romanian-Moldovan union. Romania is already a union of the Principalities of Moldova and Wallachia. All Moldovan land is by definition Romanian land that was stolen by the damned USSR.
