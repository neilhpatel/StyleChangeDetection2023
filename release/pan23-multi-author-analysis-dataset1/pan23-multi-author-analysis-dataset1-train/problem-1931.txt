Millenials statistically are having fewer children and having them later. That coincides greatly with the 2008 financial collapse. And it's only 3 to 4 years before kids born during that period are College age. We're talking a 10-30% decline in the yearly number of college bound 18 year olds over the next 10 years. (the high point was 1010 with 3.1 million college bound 18 year olds. in 2020 it was roughly 2.7 million, and projections are putting it as low as 2.2 or 2.3 million in a few years).
Interesting. That would correlate with the rapid decline in the quality in conservative political rhetoric we’ve seen in the last thirty years or so. Its seemed to get worse every day, to the point where the politicians aren’t even trying anymore, and the pundits’ arguments, such as they are, are just laughable to the liberally educated.
