For those too young to remember, a bird flu pandemic has been a serious concern for quite some time now. Basically, it's been widely expected to lead to a major outbreak since the 1990s. To give a sense of what it might look like, historic strains include H1N1 (ie. the Spanish Flu) which killed 50 million people. Since the 1990s, higher density factory farms -- driven by consumer demand for poultry -- have increased the risk of a major outbreak. Bird flu, swine flu, and wild animal derived viruses like the 2003 SARS outbreak have led to deadly international outbreaks. COVID-19 – another SARS virus – is only one of many, and it's not only plausible but likely inevitable that we'll see further pandemics if we don't seriously re-consider our food systems (and not just wild animals sold in Chinese "wet markets" but domestic animals in Euro-American factory farms).
True. In comparison, another avian influenza, the 1918 Pandemic f/k/a the Spanish Flu, had a mortality rate of 10% and infected 1/3 of the global population.
