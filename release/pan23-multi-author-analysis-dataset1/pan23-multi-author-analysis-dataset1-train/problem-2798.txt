If they are harassing you, go no contact and if they feel so inclined, can file a small claims suit against you. It’s nice that they know what they want. It’s also nice that you know that you can say no.
I think the only issue in this case is that she's also demanding back August's rent, amounting to $1000, from us, when we already gave it to the landlord in late July, and which we have been openly communicating with our non-responsive landlord about getting back due to the damages to our apartment. She knows this, and we've told her an approximate timeline for when we'll get that back to her (around late September, we've been open about the process), but she and her parents are still demanding the full sum of $2500 from my roommate and I, which includes the $1500 that we need to get back from the landlord (that we don't yet have but will come back to us) and also an additional $1000 for August rent that we don't even know we're going to get back, and we told her we were trying. From our perspective, she's basically demanding an additional $1000 on the spot that neither of us have on top of the $1500 that we had to take out of our own funds just to get to her sooner because she's insisting.
