So in TN, if they knew the child before it’s parents passing, the grandparents do have a right to see their grandkids. Even if they haven’t known the child, sometimes arrangements are made so they can get to know them. It’s almost a guarantee that your son will one day want to know about his dad.
It is discriminatory, but discrimination - even protected class discrimination - is not illegal in this context. Your child's relatives can file for custody on the basis of discriminatory beliefs, and there's not a damn thing you can do to punish them for it or to dissuade them from their beliefs through the courts.
The courts are unlikely to award the child's grandparents sole custody or to remove your child from your care over this, unless there's also concrete evidence you are a danger to your kid in some way. Merely being nonbinary is not dangerous. The courts _are_ somewhat likely to grant the child's grandparents visitation, but not custody, all else being equal, for reasons u/severe_thunderstorm laid out.
