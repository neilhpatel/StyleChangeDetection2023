This war is unfortunately not over yet either. Russia still is dangerous and we might meme about it all day long but it doesn't change a fact hundreds of people die every day, potentially hundreds of thousands were forcefully moved inside Russia and millions are left without hot water and electricity. It's not over yet and Ukraine still needs shitton of support to defend itself.
Then there's problem 3 - Ukraine wants to ally with West. Russia needs to invade countries every now and then to mask their domestic issues and there's a problem here - you can't invade NATO members because it's too powerful. And Ukraine is not just a random country either. It's big, has over 40 million people, had quite impressive military production capabilities alongside with food production and it also was part of Russia until not that long ago (and it was allied with it until like what, a mere decade ago, not even that).
This might not be a bad strategy. If I had to choose between a bad cover of “Wonderwall” and risking certain death on the Ukrainian front, I’d have to say it would be a 50/50 proposition for me.
