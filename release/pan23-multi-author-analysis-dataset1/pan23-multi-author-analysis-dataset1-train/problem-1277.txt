Sure... there are LOADS of criticism you can have for Eric Adams: He's an idiot, a cop bootlicker, he's corrupt, he doesn't live in New York, he doesn't know what he's talking about, he's more interested in hanging out with celebrities than being the Mayor, he doesn't care about poor people or people of color, his policies are failing, he's the worst Mayor in recent history, he not really a Democrat, he's thr poster child for cronyism, he's friends are even stupider than he is, he's bought and paid for by corporate real estate interests, he doesn't know what he's doing, he's a liar and he's bad at that too, the only people who like him are racist cops on Staten Island and idiots, he isn't doing anything, he can barely form a coherent thought, he looks like an uncircumcised penis.... BUT... wait... What were we talking about?
That is factually incorrect. Crime is up >20% over 2010 levels. This is why voters get pissed. The gaslighting is nonstop. It’s not the crack epidemic. That was decades ago. But it’s also much less safe than the prior decade. Ignoring this is a recipe for electoral disaster.
