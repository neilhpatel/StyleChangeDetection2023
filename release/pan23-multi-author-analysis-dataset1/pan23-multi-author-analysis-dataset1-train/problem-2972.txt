I don't have good data for the Thirty Years War, but during the early phases of the Eighty Years War, revenues of the Spanish crown excluding New World silver can be estimated at roughly 247,000,000 grams of silver, which with a population of about 14 million in Europe, is a bit over 17 grams per person. When bonus pay is factored in, the average Spanish footsoldier might expect 6 escudos per month, or about 10.7 grams of silver per day; I don't have an easy to use price index for seeing how much purchasing power that actually had, but it's not much more than unskilled laborers in Spain. Spain thus had the capacity to field 128,000 men for 180 days. An army of about half that number was in the Netherlands, plus a large Mediterranean fleet, and there were garrisons in Italy and North Africa and across Spain's world empire. I can't say exactly how many men they had under arms or how many were cavalry for a precise comparison, but they don't seem to have done much worse than ancient monarchies like Egypt, Makedon, and the Seleukids at turning population into money into soldiers.
