Before we discuss the little we do know about the Greek cities of central Asia, it might be useful to survey the political history of the region. After Alexander's death, his eastern conquests were incorporated into the kingdom of Seleucus, who reigned over an empire stretching from Aegean to the Hindu Kush. Seleucus gave the easternmost reaches of his domains to the Indian empire-builder Chandragupta Maurya in exchange for 500 war elephants (which turned out to be a good deal, since Seleucus used those elephants to win the critical battle of Ipsos). Seleucus preserved his central Asia domains, however, and continued to encourage Greek settlers - both retired soldiers and adventurers from old Greece - to settle in the fertile lands of Bactria. But under Seleucus' successors, the governors of Bactria became increasingly independent; and from about 250 BC onward, they ruled as independent kings of a large and prosperous realm.
That jarred a bit. However, we are talking about 2300 years before the present day, and the historical definition of the Punjab then, which includes far more than the small Indian state of modern Punjab. eg likely beyond even . to include portions of modern day Afghanistan, Pakistan, India etc.
