7%, as per the OBR, this is the worst fall since records began. Furthermore, house prices are likely to drop by up to 9% over the next 2 years.
The factors influencing the current government's policies are now much more heavily skewed towards internal Conservative party politics (as they don't have a mandate to stick to their election manifesto) so they can be heavily influenced to make decisions that benefit their members and donors.
Why are falling house prices so grim? By all accounts wasn't housing massively overpriced and unaffordable? The same thing happens here in the US where the media cheerleads for high housing prices.
It matters because of the first past the post system, calculated constituency by constituency (as opposed to nationwide proportional representation), strongly favours the 2 main political parties to the exclusion of the smaller parties and independents.
Hey grammar Nazis, can I use etc. in that manner above‽ Or would it fall into that weird colloquialism/lexicology area of evolution of grammar (as opposed to my ignorance)‽.
