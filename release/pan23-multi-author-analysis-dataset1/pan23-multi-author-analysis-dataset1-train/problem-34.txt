thanks, i'm taking that approach now, although the other party works as in house counsel at a financial institution some counties away and has never been near a court as far as i know, and certainly not the type of court this current matter is going to end up in. But maybe they're running a match on their name in an Esq. database or something. anyway, thanks. onwards, and away from here.
I'm not saying in this case specifically it's a tactic (seems like as a practicing attorney, the other attorneys might actually have conflicts unrelated to this tactic), just that it 100% can be and is known among attorneys to be a tactic, especially in family law.
You may not get an answer, or one you like. If they don't believe they have the resources or expertise to take on the other attorneys they may be backing out with a generic excuse.
Understood. I guess I thought the only reason for a conflict would be if the other party had worked with this attorney at some point. I can’t imagine they’ve worked with the first 3 firms I’ve called on a matter that is new. Just trying to wrap my head around why this is happening.
