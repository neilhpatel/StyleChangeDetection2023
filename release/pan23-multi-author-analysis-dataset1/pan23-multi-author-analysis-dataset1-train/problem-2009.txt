Russia's thinking "If we murder civilians on Christmas, the people of Ukraine will take to the streets demanding Zelenskyy give us everything we ask for, plus an Edible Arrangement for all the trouble he put us through.".
also russia: destroys Mariupol (a mostly russian speaking city in the Donbas with a large ethnic russian minority) killing tens of thousands Ukrainian citizens(minimum. possibly even more then 100,000.).
They're copying the Russian foreign policy of dozens of similar strikes explicitly aimed towards civilian areas and public places during the day, and residential areas at night, over the course of the past 10 months, which in itself is copying the Russian foreign policy of Aleppo and Grozny.
You can, no-one is willing to call their bluff at the moment though. At some point in the future the situation will change enough to bring them back to the table, whether that's from Putin falling out a window, the progress of the war, or domestic discontent as their economy keeps sinking we don't know but nothing lasts forever.
