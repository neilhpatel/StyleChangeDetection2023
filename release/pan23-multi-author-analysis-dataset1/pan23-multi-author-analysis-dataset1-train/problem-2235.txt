The two strands of racialized geographic thought entangle to push forward the same idea: people from the south (Africa) are black because it is warm/the sun makes it hot/they have warmer humors; people from the north (Europe and sometimes northern Asia) are white because it is cold/they have colder humors. Note that climatological determinism does not, inherently, have a moralized component. For example, Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun associates the darker skin of sub-Saharan Africans with exposure to a hotter sun, not any kind of moral difference.
And above all, whether the idea of black skin, hot climates/the south/Africa, and badness get tied together in the European imagination, is in the discourse in literary and proto-scientific texts on Islam and Muslims.
So by the time Europe's sailors are pushing beyond the Mediterranean and North Sea, the ties between geography, skin color, and morality are well entrenched thanks to centuries of writing incubated in and by cultural ties and religious antagonism with Muslims.
Thanks for all this - great information. I’d be sorta leery of putting the good vs evil debate in terms of skin color, when shade would probably be a better word? (Given that this topic specifically asks about what we now refer to as race.).
For example, we can see a movement to allegorize the Ham:south:heat connection as early as Jerome (late antiquity), picked up by early medieval authors and then the high medieval encyclopedists who will set the 'discourse on race'. Ham is hot, writes Jerome. To Rabanus Maurus (9th century), the heat of Ham represents the "primordial passions of the Jews and heretics, which disturb the peace of the holy.".
I would recommend you check out u/victoryfanfare‘s answer to „Europe had normal diplomatic relations with non-white nations before turning explosively racist to justify their actions against all others. What happened to cause this shift?“ wherein they delve deeply into the history of scientific racism.
