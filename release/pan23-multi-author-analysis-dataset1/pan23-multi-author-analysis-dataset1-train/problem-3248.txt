What I have discovered about people threatening to sue you, they never have an attorney on retainer, and are ignorant of the entire process. IANAL, but if someone threatens to sue me, I would reply “that’s great, your deposition is going to be epic” Also if he is using the Church’s internet, you might want to give them a heads up about him being less than honest with things. In addition, you might want to contact your state’s department of insurance and file a fraud complaint. Your dental insurance would probably be very supportive. I would ask my dental insurance if they have an SIU section. In my state, it’s required every insurance company has to have a Special Investigation Unit. Be sure to mention the Facebook posts.
He can theoretically sue you regardless of the merits of the case and if you find yourself properly served with a lawsuit, no matter how ridiculous, you have to treat it as serious to avoid summary judgement. An unfortunate implication of this system is that you can bully people with frivolous lawsuits, forcing them to spend some time and money getting the case dismissed.
2. When people talk about a million dollars they are usually just talking. I'd be more concerned about someone threatening to sue for $450,000, because that sounds like they might know the law and have reasoning for their amount, instead of just being mad and wanting a million dollars.
1. The person suing you actually thinks they have a case, because they don't understand the law or are irrational.
