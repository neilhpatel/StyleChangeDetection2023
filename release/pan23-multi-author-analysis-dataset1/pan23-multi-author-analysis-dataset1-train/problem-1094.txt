In History, I cannot think of a situation where I use history for some end(like the synthesize in the chemical paper) and then have to prove to the reader that all my work is sound. I mean...maybe I could write where history gives us precedent to solve a given issue. Like how courts use legal precedence to help answer modern legal questions. Or where people in history learned from the further past (say, Washinon using Fabius Maximus’ style ware fare to win the American independence war) but this usually devolves into already established fact(like Washinon’s love for the classics) or mostly speculation( i.e comparisons of current politics to different situations and expected causes and outcomes, like comparing the President to a certain failed art student with a Charlie Chaplin mustache).
Your logic seems pretty sound. History is far more popular than even any other social sciences, I’d even say more popular than psychology - which has it’s own term for the subset of work aimed at the general public, pop psychology.
