People felt sympathy for civil rights marchers because they saw innocent and normal people getting beaten for just asking for basic rights everyone else has. These environment protests instead look like a bunch of entitled clowns engaging in mindless destruction for attention.
These moronic environmental protests produced no sympathy from anyone, just disgust. Protesting isn't a magic spell you cast that causes the thing you want to come true. If you can't explain how your protest results in people becoming sympathetic to your cause, your protest is stupid and ineffective.
These idiots were doing protests that produced only anger and no sympathy, which is why they were ineffective and dumb.
These absolute brain dead morons only produced anger. Anger makes people want to hit you, not give into your demands.
The british government surrendered to the IRA, and let the Americans and the Republic of Ireland be guarantors even though they are blatantly biased against Britain (especially Joe Biden, who as senator was one of the leading figure supporting the IRA in America and supporting american involvement in the GFA).
This. Whenever anyone talks about Extinction Rebellion, it’s always to remark about “those assholes who threw shit at the famous paintings.” Nothing else. Hell, I bet most people don’t know a single other thing about them. These stunts are duds, and it’s weird people are still arguing that they aren’t.
