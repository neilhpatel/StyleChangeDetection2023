The Di （帝） (title used by the Shang ruler) functioned both as the political supreme ruler of the state and the high priest (some scholars push for the "godking" theory of Shang Di, but such view is not supported by textual evidence from the time). The Shang Di would carve divination text on matters of state importance (e.g. questions concerning military campaigns, relief from drought) onto prepared bone surfaces typically made from tortoise carapaces and oxen bones. After divination questions have been inscribed, the Shang Di would poke the bone with a preheated thin bronze rod, an ritual called bo (卜） which causes cracks to form on the oracle bone surface, representing the divine answer from supreme Shang deity Shang-Di (上帝, lit.: “high lord”).
There is always more to say, of course, but there are some fundamental historiographical and archaeological problems with the idea that the Chinese actually acted in this way. I discussed these issues briefly in an earlier response, and you might like to review that thread while you wait for fresh answers to your question.
