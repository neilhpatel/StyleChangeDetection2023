This. As long as they don’t start writing in random names, I’m cool with it. I want a straight up Progressive party, but our best bet is to transform the Democratic Party into it by getting their candidates through the primaries and getting them elected. Otherwise I’ll support whatever non-Republican that gets nominated.
And then it didn't. Any territory like that in the modern world is just going to be invaded instantly. They wouldn't have the means to defend themselves against a modern military, and places like Russia and China will have no qualms about taking over "free land.".
The leftists and the less right-wing (ACTUAL Ted Roosevelt tier pro-environmental conservation national park type conservatives) of the two moderate parties could form a coalition, and the center-left party could coalition with the further right moderate party.
The moderate and corporate Dems could make the two center right parties, the most progressive Dems could make the leftist party after expanding their numbers high enough, the kinda-sorta progressive ones (I consider people like Ted Lieu and Ro Khanna to be the "kinda-sorta progressive but not really" types) could make the center-left party and expand upon it as well.
My unrealistic fantasy is a 4-party system, with 2 left-wing parties (a straight-up socdem progressive leftist one, and a center-left one that's a little bit more to the left than the current Democrats are) and 2 center-right parties (which are about the same as the current Democrats).
