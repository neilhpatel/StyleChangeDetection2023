The problem with this kind of informality is that your proof is as good as theirs. If I were their attorney, I would argue that the keys and the texts are, at a minimum, evidence of intent to form a month-to-month lease, so you need to provide 30 days notice to terminate and owe the rent for that period, i.e., the deposit.
Tough one. From what I can see, does not apply to oral contracts for short term housing. Moreover, unless you found this listing on a bodega flyer, I'd imagine there exists some electronic communication about the mutually agreed contours of the deal (address, price, term) even if it's missing all the T&C normally found in a lease.
What? Sure, the tenant can try to negotiate an early lease termination (often called "cash for keys), but the tenant can't leave without making such an agreement with the LL and then say "I left, you owe me money.".
Depending what other facts come out (and what others more experienced in NYC case law might bring up), there's a chance you could fight for the deposit back instead, especially if the tyrannical behavior rises to a violation of local law, which is quite extensive & strict. However there's also a chance of being held responsible for the full term discussed in your email/txt inquiry, so the expected value of raising a stink strikes me as negative.
