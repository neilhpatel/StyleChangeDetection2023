So, why is it that the history of theatre & drama largely overlooks or outright ignores the historical era of the Middle Ages? In my estimation, there are 4 key reasons:
There was plenty of more interesting theatre written in non-Western parts of the world, but (warning: cynical attitude incoming) that would require European and American high schools to actually care about those cultures enough to incorporate their literature into their curricula.
Thanks for the reply Sorry if I came off a bit snarky. I can sometimes be a bit defensive when addressing questions in my field simply because there are so many misconceptions that keep getting reiterated. Iâ€™ve had to develop an aggressive tone in my writing because even major historians will repeat worn out tropes and narratives, so in my work, you have to come out swinging. Thanks again.
Now, as the modpost notes, I can't really address why schools don't teach about this, since pedagogy isn't a focus of mine, but I can talk about what was going on in that era, and why it isn't considered particularly noteworthy, which probably answers the question implicitly, but I can't say for sure. I will also note that my focus is primarily Greek theatre, and this question steps out of my wheelhouse a bit (and my access to scholarly sources at the moment is more limited than I'd like), and as such this whole response will be a frankenstein mash-up of a regular write-up and hardcore faq-finding. More can be said about all these topics, including the specific decisions and event that led to schools developing these curricula, if anyone wishes to contribute and dive deeper, as well as the legacy of all these works, but this should serve as something of a primer.
