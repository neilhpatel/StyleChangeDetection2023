1. The why. Why would she do it? I think it she thought of it as some type of reward. She and her fellow jurors have had a few exceptional months, with a certain hardship of having to keep quiet, don't watch media etc. And she wanted to get rewarded for that.
While this clown should be looking down the barrel of multiple charges that should put his lying, scheming, greasy ass where it belongs, he is instead the front-running candidate of the political party that does nothing but enrich themselves at the cost of everyone and the environment we all depend on, parading around like a peacock and handing out bottles of water to people suffering a man-made disaster that he and his administration helped enable, and those same dumbass people will vote for him again.
4. And it was a bit naive. Rightwing media will cut up her interview, misrepresent it and turn it on it head to protect their interests. If she didn't do the interview, they couldn't do that. And she might not be too interested in politics (otherwise she probs was filtered out in the selection), but you must have been totally living under a rock not to know what hell the rightwing unleashes on emotional females.
