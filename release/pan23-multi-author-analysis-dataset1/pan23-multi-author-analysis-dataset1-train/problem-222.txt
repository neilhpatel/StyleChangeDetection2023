NAL, id say since your land was apportioned and sold to you before his land even existed, this would be a point in your favor. Your neighbor may need to contact whoever he bought land from for further documentation and compare it with your original documentation. As someone else pointed out, this will likely and up going to court since your neighbor is so adamant on the land being his. Or you can agroo to split the difference in half.
My attorney gave me a slew of options (got him after the neighbors' attorney sent me a letter saying to sign away the land or be sued) and I had the option of pissing off neighbors and dragging it through court for a long time (covid slowing things down as well), asking them to pay me for the disputed land, or just sign it away and be done with it immediately. Went with the middle option and neighbors were amenable to that and we get along alright now. I recommend getting a lawyer to discuss your options on this and keeping in mind how much you want to get along with this neighbor going forward as well. As OP describes it, doesn't sound like either side is at fault so it just sucks for everyone now.
