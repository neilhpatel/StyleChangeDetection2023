That said, while Electoral Count Act reform would protect against a 2020-type challenge, there are myriad other ways for an election-denying secretary of state, attorney general, or governor to gum up the electoral process, restrict voting rights, or sow confusion around elections. And presidential elections aren’t the only concern: They could cause problems for other races too, and almost certainly will where they’re virtually certain to win. Absent major (and unlikely) political reform, they’re going to continue to pose a risk as long as they remain so influential within the GOP. — Travis.
How often do you speak uncritically - that is, without attacking but instead talking to, listening to, trying to legitimately understand without precondition, and have a fair exchange of thoughts and reasoning with - people who disagree with you on these types of issues?
Hi! Yea totally get that. So I’ll admit it’s kind of a tough term to define, especially as the conservative movement and the GOP have basically been almost wholly subsumed by MAGA, which I would characterize as an extremist, anti-democratic movement.
Hello. In the post, you mention that you write about far-right extremism. There seems to be a lot of ambiguity with that term. Can you define what far-right extremism is?
