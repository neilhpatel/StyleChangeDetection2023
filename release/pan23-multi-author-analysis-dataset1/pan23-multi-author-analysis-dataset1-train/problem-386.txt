I came to say this. Also if they're YOUR appliances and she has taken them away that would constitute as theft so if thats the case i would also recomend contacting the police to get them back and establish a paper trail that could be useful should you two have to go the courtroom route.
Yes. State security deposit laws do not apply to owner-occupied buildings with three or fewer units unless the tenant gives 30 days' written notice to the landlord of the tenant's wish to invoke the law.
Not necessarily. It could be an owner occupied single-family dwelling, which would mean the owner and tenant are sharing living quarters, and the tenant would be protected under the laws we're discussing here. If it's two units or less than four, the owner still needs a reason to evict but they have the benefit of being able to say family is going to live in the unit(s) or they wish to sell the property.
Which appliances, specifically? I think most of us assume washer/dryer, but is the stove/oven or refrigerator gone as well?
