I have one question based on your description, and it is very unrelated and vastly less important than the actual subject of this response, but I was curious.
Furious, the larger community responded. A second march was held a week later and dwarfed the first one. Despite many more people showing up to deter black equality this time, over 175 buses were quickly loaded at the MLK center, leaving hundreds behind. Another 10 buses were procured and filled yet many participants still needed a ride. Estimates by the county sheriff put the marchers at about 15,000 strong with some estimates as high as 20,000. For scale, Dr King himself drew 25,000 on the Selma to Montgomory March of 1965, making this the largest since that event. Lining the sides of the long parade, klan representatives - including David Duke - shouted things like "We hate N·····s", "N·····s go home", and "KKK is here to stay" while they were met with responses of "I love you" and "hey hey, ho, ho, the KKK has got to go." Signs read hateful slogans like "Kill em all and let God sort em" and "Forsyth's Purity is our Security." Despite the massive amounts of potential, riot gear clad officers, GBI agents, and national guardsmen largely kept the two apart and only about 60 arrests were made (including, big surprise, David Duke for trying to block the highway and prevent the march).
