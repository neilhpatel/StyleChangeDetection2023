So in most cases, you already probably work for the government in some capacity — either directly or through a contractor — if you are in a position to have a useful idea along these lines. We tend to lionize the idea of "lone inventors" coming up with great ideas out of "nowhere" but in practice if you are going to make serious progress in a field of technology in the 20th century, you probably already need to be plugged into networks of people and research, and if it's a field that has military or industrial implications, there are already probably a lot of people working in it. This is just worth noting from the beginning, because it's exceedingly rare for a lone inventor to come up with a good idea that is useful for weapons or gadgets, and this is one of the reasons why the infrastructure for funding or finding such people is pretty slim (as opposed to the infrastructure for developing ideas that come up in national laboratories or industrial contractors).
Do you have any insight on which way the causality runs here? Has the government focused on institutions because there have been very few lone inventors, or conversely, have there been few lone inventors because of the many apparently anti-individual policies you mention?
So in short, no. If you invent or discover something that the government thinks is in its interest to develop, and you are unwilling or unable to develop it, they will find a way to develop it. There are various mechanisms by which this can happen.
