Yes yes it is. Would be nice if one democratic leader or the fucking president would say this. The real groomers are the religious zealots who have molested hundreds of thousands of kids since 1950. They moved around the molesters. I just heard a story from a friend who went to a catholic school. When a priest molested a kid and got sent away the school said he got sent south. Meaning he was sent to their other school in Texas where he could molest freely. Also the dorms they had at this catholic school were run by the priests. They were known to hang about boys door ways and tried to proposition them. Thatâ€™s some fucking grooming. Those are some groomers. So we should call them that.
