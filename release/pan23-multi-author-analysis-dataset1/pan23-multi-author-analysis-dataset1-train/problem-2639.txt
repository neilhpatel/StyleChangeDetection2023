You said you got in touch with the sheriff. What did they have to say about all this? Did you get back in touch when DNR confirmed the animal had been killed/butchered by a person?
Donkeys are unreliable and temperamental. They're a bit like geese. Geese are amazing at guarding their flock but they are also extremely temperamental and need to be raised from a baby to accept their flock and vice versa and even then sometimes it doesn't happen. Donkeys are even less reliable than geese and also prefer to guard birds/flocks than sheep. Livestock guardian breeds have been bred specifically for this exact reason for centuries and are the most reliable animal to protect livestock and property. They're naturally suspicious of strangers, almost entirely nocturnal, and are typically fairly fuckin big as far as dogs go. Also, I deal with Donkeys daily and I'd take on 10 angry Donkeys than 2 properly trained LGDs any day.
Tactacam Reveal. Those are game cameras that go directly to your phone. I run 5 of them for game but use them for security as well. Goes through an app. We also used them to get a weasel that was getting in the chicken coop. They are around 100-120$ each and are a good product. Neighbor has a guardian dog for his sheep. It is a beast and I would never dream of crossing that fence. Lays in the feed bunk and if it has to get up you better be paying attention. A bit of liability with the dog route. In case it bites the wrong person. If you are comfortable with firearms I would suggest keeping that in the truck too. Its legal in Iowa and these sound like real dipshits. Success depends on preparation.
