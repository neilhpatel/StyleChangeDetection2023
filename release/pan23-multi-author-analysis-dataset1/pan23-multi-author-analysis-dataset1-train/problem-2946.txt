Now, I have written quite a lot here to address the premise of your question, but not really what you asked, but the two are quite related. The takeaway, I hope, at this point is that even if the Nazis were not effective about it, nor doing so out of concern for the humanity of the prisoners, they did make at least some attempts to contain disease in the camps, although at the same time it should certainly not be said that they particularly cared about their failures, especially seeing as large-scale killing was one 'solution' they pursued. And lest we consider for a moment more effective control wasn't possible, upon liberation of Bergen-Belsen, the British were able to report that there were no new typhus infections within two weeks of implementing their delousing program, although a number of prisoners, far to weakened and already infected, did pass away following their liberation.
Thank you for your harrowing answer! It lead me to read up on vaccines for typhus, but can't find any that were used in the forties (even now it's "not commercially available"). Typhoid fever is vaccinated against, though, and the first typhoid vaccines were developed in 1896 by Almroth Edward Wright, Richard Pfeiffer, and Wilhelm Kolle. Typhus is due to a rickettsia bacteria and typhoid fever is due to a salmonella bacteria.
