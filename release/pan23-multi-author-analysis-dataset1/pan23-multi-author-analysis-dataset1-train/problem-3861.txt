If it is on a public street and not private property a tow truck can't just tow the car legally without the police being involved and authorizing a tow from public property. Do you have any sources that say otherwise?
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a vehicle may be removed immediately after being illegally parked within 15 feet of a fire hydrant, in a fire lane, in a manner that interferes with an entrance to, or an exit from, the private property, or in a parking space or stall legally designated for disabled persons.
Here is the key part: (a) An owner or person in lawful possession of private property that is held open to the public, or a discernible portion thereof, for parking of vehicles at no fee, or an employee or agent thereof, shall not tow or remove, or cause the towing or removal, of a vehicle within one hour of the vehicle being parked.
This isn't true in all cities in CA like San Francisco. But it probably is true in Santa Barbara county, hard to say for sure without the city.
