The victims' rights laws are pretty clear and give a lot of rights to victims in the states I'm familiar with them. They're worth reading, or looking up, in any state. I assume they exist in every state. In my state, they guarantee victims the right to "respect for their dignity and privacy". You might ask if you can consult with the prosecutor and get transcripts of the hearing anonymously, or to present statements to the court anonymously. I don't know how that would work out as I've never seen it requested before and haven't looked into it, but you could try.
Habitual criminals who are accustomed to lenient prosecutorial policy are often flippant about the probability that they will ever be severely punished.
You should read my other comment on this thread. You are entitled to fair compensation under the criminal proceedings by the victims' rights laws for your state. You would not need to file a civil suit for this. I would recommend you read through the link I posted on my other comment of the victims' rights for your state. They're the same for all the other states I know of. Then come up with a list of what you want, and contact the prosecutors' office with your requests. Compensation from the criminal is a right guaranteed by law, and requires no expense from you.
