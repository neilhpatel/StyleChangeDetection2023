No it’s not. Stalkers often target their victims and cause isolation in order to cause negative psychological effects and destroy them mentally. They are sociopaths. The emotional distress of having your career ended over and over and over, your friendships ended over and over and over, your relationships ended over plans over and over, and her coming back into my life over and over and over after being told not to is psychotic behavior and stalking as well as harassment and cyber stalking.

4th romantic relationship stalker destroyed. Ignore initials. The pattern of stalker goes like this. Break him up with girlfriend, break up with my boyfriend, try to get him back by contact either by myself or using others, doesn’t work so try to destroy his career and end friendships, he gets with someone else, pattern starts over.
