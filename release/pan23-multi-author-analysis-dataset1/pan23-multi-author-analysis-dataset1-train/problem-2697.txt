Sounds like you mom needs to do three things. One, find a new job that will treat her better for the work she does. Two, let the client know about this. And three file a wage theft report with the dept of labor. They just love things like this.
Neither Florida nor the federal government have laws requiring employers to reimburse employees for costs they incur while performing their job duties, so there most likely isn't any legal requirement for her boss to pay her those reimbursements, unless her employer explicitly promised to pay them to her and then failed to do so after she performed the work in question, or unless the actual costs she is incurring from using her personal car are bringing her effective pay below the state minimum wage of $10/hr.
Yeah shes gonna look elsewhere but she has an emotional attachment to her clients so it might take a while. He’s a typical bad boss honestly and he’s even made unwanted comments on her appearance before. She doesn’t see him too often and dealt with the bad behavior. This is our breaking point. I’m always making her defend herself but she understands that she can’t let this one slide so easily. We’ll contact the program director and file a report depending on what they say.
