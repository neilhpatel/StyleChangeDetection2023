You can deny Climate Change (tm) and still think that pollution and abuse of the environment is a grave matter. Climate change to me means crush the middle class and purposefully make energy expensive so businesses can continue to not innovate or shift their operations. Climate change also signifies the strategy companies took in the 70s by saying itâ€™s the average citizen that needs to bear the burden of fixing things and not companies.
No shit. Emissions goals are not even remotely being hit for hitting 1.5 or even 2.0 degrees by end of century. Right now we are on pace to hit at least 2.7 degrees by end of century and even that is likely underestimating due to feedback loops.
Faux-lanthropist. Donates to others by not paying the people he employs and by leaving behind environmental messes that destroy communities and gobble up tax dollars with SuperFund cleanups:
What? There's nothing wrong with high consumption if it's sustainable. High population is fine too - the pollution output of a billion humans is relatively negligable.
A billions humans pollute very, very little, naturally. Producing the things they consume CAN pollute a lot.
There is nowhere on earth that is predictably safe because this weather/biological/geological event is literally unprecedented. The climate has never changed at the rate it's currently changing.
