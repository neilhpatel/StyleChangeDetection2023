Firstly, what did a yeoman do? Secondly, where would they have lost all of their wealth?! (Hypothetically).
The expedition was on YouTube posted sometime back. Not sure if I am allowed to post the think. The director talks about the statue around 4:30 into the video.
Medieval Icelanders sometimes used the term as a general term for foreign/heathen barbarian warriors; several sagas use the alliterative phrase _blámenn ok berserkir_ ('blue men and berserkers' -'blue men' being their term for black people) So perhaps it wasn't perceived as a particular Norse cultural thing.
Is there any way to check how accurate a textbook is? I'm a history teacher who is pretty new to it (first year with history, 8th year overall) and I caught my textbook misrepresenting certain events in American History. I am correcting it as I go, but if there is a resource that could help that would be great. Would save a lot of time as well.
Besides some linguistic arguments (_ber_ as in 'bare_ was originally _baR_ in older Old Norse), perhaps the strongest reason in favor of reading _berserkr_ as 'bear-shirt' is the fact that there's a second (less common) term _ulfheðinn_ ('wolf-pelt') that _also_ seems to refer to a ferocious warrior.
Thank you so much for taking the time to type out that information. One other question if I may add since you talked about it. Is there anything to the idea of the berserkr being a sort of champion or elite troop in sense? Not a crazy animal like worrier most see the name as.
