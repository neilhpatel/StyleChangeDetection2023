This is trashy. At least with the U2 incident America got caught by surprise by Russia being able to shoot the state of the art plane down with an air defense system that America underestimated. That was much more sophisticated than just hoping Russia wouldn't notice an otherwise defenseless aircraft. China has no reason to think balloons were going to continue flying over America with impunity or continue to do so after the US made it clear it was noticing and investigating their presence, and they have no excuse being this caught off guard when the shoe finally dropped.
Yes! And especially when it’s over occupied land……you rush that, you kill civilians. And if that happened, these same people would be mad about “how dare he shoot that object down 60k feet above American citizens”……..can never win.
