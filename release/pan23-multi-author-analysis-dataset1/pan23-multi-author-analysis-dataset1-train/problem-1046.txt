If you get a medical recommendation and ask the court for leniency because of the change in public policy, you might get a better outcome.
In some places, if you're eligible for a medical recommendation the court will decide that you are protected by those laws even if you haven't gotten the recommendation before you committed the possession violation. I have seen that argued successfully in Arizona but can't say about Georgia.
My medical condition is not "legally inadequate" I have mental illnesses that are considered disabilities (major depressive disorder, ptsd, autism spectrum, in addition to chronic pain) and I do qualify for a prescription but it wouldnt matter, according to everyone.
At best the judge would mute you and reschedule your hearing. Judges have little patience for disruption of the court process even over Zoom. It's unlikely that you would get a contempt citation for insulting the judge or disrupting court, but having whatever conditions you're under from pretrial release extended because you are refusing to resolve your case is very likely.
