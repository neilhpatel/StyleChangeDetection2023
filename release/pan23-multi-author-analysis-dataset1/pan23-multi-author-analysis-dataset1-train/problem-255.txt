Again, depends on the specifics of the logo, the entity that may or may not own the trademark on the logo, and what their permissions in use of that logo are. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but a good rule of thumb is "don't use trademarked logos that you don't have permission to use.".
The major exception is that works created by federal employees on behalf of the federal government cannot be copywritten; it's automatically placed into the public domain (See 17 USC 105). However, the federal government is permitted to contract with private companies to have them create something, and license the content from that company. When they do so, the contractor is permitted to maintain the copyright. (You can see this in action at the National Park Service sites. Most of them have historical videos playing. Even though the work was created for the NPS, they still have a copyright notice on them). There are also specific protections for the use of Federal Agency logos and marks. A copyright holder can also assign the copyright to the federal government; who can maintain the copyright without placing it into the public domain.
Yes, government institutions can hold copyright and trademarks; and unauthorized use of those copyrights/trademarks would be infringement.
There are exceptions to copyright and trademark laws covering fair use; however the internet generally has a very warped perception on what "fair use" actually is. The fact that something is "private" or "non-commercial" does not automatically imply that the use if fair use; although it is a factor to be considered pursuant to 17 USC 107.
