The only reason they're tolerated is because they open up some state grants and leverage that can be useful down the road, not to mention that the operational losses are tax write offs. However, when it comes to care, only ERs are mandated to treat, regardless of a patients ability to pay. Urgent cares and others can require deposits down to treat and all can opt for cheaper care options, which many do treat people.
Citation needed. While I'd read a lot of "doctors _could_ refuse you as a patient" in the context of non-emergency care, I never saw any examples of doctors actually doing that. I've really only seen that documented in practice for transplant recipients. Because there's lots of people who need transplants and if you aren't willing to do what all current medical science supports as decreasing your risk of infection/increasing your chance of survival, they'll pass that organ on to someone who is willing to take care of it. And that seems entirely fair.
This process could definitely use some reform, but then again, I'd rather see a French style, national healthcare system in the US, where the government provides the financial backing for healthcare and insurance companies transition into regional points of adjudication and contact, working according to unified, government guidelines, where profit isn't the motivation for healthcare.
Jesus Christ dude. You think obesity in the US is why single payer wouldnâ€™t work? Really grasping at straws here.
