In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Hm. Yeah honestly I think the better comparison would be the Joker. Some “mentally ill” 20-something who thinks he has been wronged by the system and decides to throw everything into chaos.
Unrelated.. I can get why some say or write “of” instead of “have” but how do you literally read a headline that says have and write of?

Unfortunately, the American right-wing’s overwhelming partisanship and absolute rejection of any accountability within their party have the left the country- and democracy- in an extremely precarious situation. As the above scholar notes, impeachment may be the only recourse to return legitimacy to our highest court- and accomplishing that will require work from diligent, patriotic voters who recognize the rising dangers of fascism and corruption among RepubliKKKans and the right-wing broadly.
