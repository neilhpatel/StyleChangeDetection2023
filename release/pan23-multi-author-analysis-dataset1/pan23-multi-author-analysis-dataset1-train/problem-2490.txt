hey man, I'm a little hungover right now so I didn't manage to read all of your amazing answer, but I have a question. What position did the natives used since they mocked the missionary position? doggy style?
I give more details in the above linked post, but the complaint among Melanesian women about the “European style” (what Kinsey calls the “Anglo-American style” and we know as “missionary position”) seems to be 1) that the European men finish the intimate act too quickly and 2) the position doesn’t allow them the culturally appropriate range of female motion, nor does it account sufficiently for the possibility of female pleasure (though this is more in the subtext rather than text of Malinowski), especially in that 3) the European style seems to focus on vertical (what I take to mean in-and-out movements) while the Melanesian style involves much more horizontal movement (presumably with concomitant clitoral stimulation).
I can see why, Malinowski's book is quite a good read. Given the nature and frequency of the natives' behavior, I'm surprised that he mentions extramarital conception is so rare. Additionally, he seems himself to be at a loss to explain it - do we have any more recent analysis of this? I don't wish to doubt his credibility, but it is odd the way he brushes past the subject.
