My core period of interest revolves around a series of unexpected coincidences! (At least in some tellings.).
With this force, he finally managed to conclude the long-running Numidian conflict, establishing Roman control of the Southern coast of the Mediterranean, then turned around and crushed the Cimbri completely, safeguarding the Italian Peninsula itself, decisively rebuking any criticism of himself or his forces, and creating the prototypical Roman legionary, one who was loyal to the general who paid and outfitted him, not to a city he may have never seen that spat on him.
I think you will struggle without access to a research library. There are plenty of good books but very few are in print in the English Language. The German Hansa by Phillipe Dollinger really is far and away the most comprehensive read but it is hard to find an English translation for sale (I read it in the British Library). A Companion to the Hanseatic League by Donald Harreld is similarly comprehensive but as far as I know, no longer in print.
The book I mention in my other comment, Bergen and the Hanseatic League, has a lot of primary sources regarding this incident, may be worth trying to get a hold of.
