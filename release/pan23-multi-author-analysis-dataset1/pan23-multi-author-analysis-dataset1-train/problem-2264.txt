Secondary comment from Russia: And not only are you banned from returning… but you’re also banned from joining the Russian military! How you like that for consequences?
Really? Most of the russian/soviet emigrants I've seen have been more than happy that they've left. Getting a letter from the government that "you're not wanted back" instead of "we need you to go be cannon fodder" seems to be prefreable.
"America. Love it or leave it". This is their Vietnam War. The war protesters were right and the warmongering right wing was wrong. Same thing now in Russia. Better to leave now and not go back. Horrors await those who stay.
You're basically summarizing the russian mentality. "As long as it doesn't affect me, they can do whatever".
Difference between Ukrainians and Russians is that Ukrainians couldn’t tolerate tyranny and wholesale corruption, while Russians pretend everything is fine until it effects them personally, then they throw a hissy fit and expect everyone to bed over backwards and fix the problem, because they’re ‘Russians’ and believe themselves special and worthy of exceptions and unique rules.
