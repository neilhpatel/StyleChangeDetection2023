Despite what people think, insurance (at least of the property damage/liability variety, I can't speak for health/life as those are different beasts I've never worked in) does not "try to find a way not to pay." We aren't (and cannot be) incentivized not to pay. We are obligated to investigate each claim to its fullest and justify what is paid, however, and we have to treat every customer the same. If they didn't investigate your claim to the fullest because you've been a customer for 24 years without a claim, and then they DID investigate someone else with the same circumstance because that person had been a customer for only two years, then they've be violating fair claims practice laws.
Thank you very much. The only thing that is an issue at this point is that I have a pay as you go phone plan and it takes 60 days to get my records and I think waiting another two months is just unacceptable. So if I sign that document, then I am giving them permission to wait that long. That is why I'm very hesitant to sign it. I have nothing to hide. It just seemed a bit much but I understand they have to do their due diligence. I'm just getting very agitated at this point since they just asked for the information after about a month or so.
