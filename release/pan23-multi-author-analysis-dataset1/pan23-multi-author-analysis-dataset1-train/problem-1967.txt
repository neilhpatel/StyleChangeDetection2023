There's nothing from stopping US, UK, France, Germany, etc from all leaving NATO and joining with Sweden/Finland, etc under a new treaty umbrella if Turkey strikes another NATO country.
Uh, is he? He's sent a lot of drones to Ukraine, blocked russian ship passage, amongst other things. Ukraine has a whole silly song about Bayraktars from the start of the war.
The 1914 census list underestimated non-Muslim populations. For example, in Diyarbekir the Armenian population was reported at 73,226 in the 1914 Ottoman census, but in September 1915 Mehmed Reshid announced that he had deported 120,000 Armenians from the province.
what a loaded sentence . Erbakan had nothing to do with CHP; he was the founder of "Milli Görüş", which translates to something like "national opinion", which is a Turkish nationalist-Islamist movement, as opposed to the Arabophiles ruling for 20 years now -- not that the Arabophilia is the only reason AKP is such filth. They were also both in coalition rule during both military actions in Cyprus, though the first was an intervention against the coup intending to enact Enosis, which did stop the coup in Cyprus and depose the military junta in Greece (who actually left NATO because they didn't find support for their expansionism which is pretty funny in retrospect), whereas the second was a fully nationalist act which led to the situation today.
That specific google search is the one that gave that exact quote in the first few links. If you'd like, you can look for more articles about these statements. The one promising to take back the islands included.
: oh, I thought it might help the reader to know: CHP started as a radical secularist nationalist party in a one-party system, didn't really ever become the sole ruling party after the single party period was over (1945), ended up becoming a centre left party that was a member of the Socialist International (oh and the period leading to this makes Monty Python look like your usual weekly digest), and now they're just the side opposing whatever AKP does pretty much. It's a worthy cause, get your pins today.
And this summer he's said that he supports Erdogan if he "does something about the occupied islands", and that a reckoning awaits Greece and "Greece knows the tradition we come from, and how we protect the interests of the country, they know Ecevit and Erbakan" (former leaders of CHP, which is the opposition now), the ones who orchestrated the 2nd invasion of Cyprus after their demands for segregation based on religion on the island of Cyprus was denied.

yeah this is a bit more in your face. I'll say (I was born there, I have some opinions, ok? ) ) that it seems more as pandering to the petty nationalist voter bloc in Turkey, but yeah I feel you. It's ridiculously unlikely that he takes over from the Islamist shithead, and even if he does no one would expect anything really drastic from him, but yeah it is what he said. Thanks for pointing that out, I suppose :/ but hey, maybe it gives you a bit of relief if I tell you that he's still the clown candidate. Realistically, you'll keep dealing with the Islamist imp for a good while longer!
