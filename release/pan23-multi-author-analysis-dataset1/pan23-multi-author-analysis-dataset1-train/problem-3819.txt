The majority live in private enclosures owned by individual Texans. In Texas, there are nearly no statewide restrictions on tiger ownership, and the cost of acquiring a tiger is similar to that of a purebred dog from a reputable breeder.
"In Texas, it is easier to own a tiger than a dog that's been labeled as dangerous. It's estimated there could be from 2,000 to 5,000 tigers living in this southern state of the United States â€” meaning Texas could have more tigers than the roughly 3,800 tigers living in the wild globally.".
I think there's a misconception that the entirety of India is completely full of people, but there's actual wildlife preserves dedicated to conservation, on top of still existing undeveloped land and re-forestation projects.
Ehhh, what? There are several tiger reserves in India from the Sunderbans to Corbett to Madumalai and all. Central India has a healthy population of tigers as well. There are scattered individuals outside of reserves especially in the Western Ghats.
