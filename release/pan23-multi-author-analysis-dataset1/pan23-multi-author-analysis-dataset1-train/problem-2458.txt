I suppose my concern is that Amazon is the only one which really hits company profits in a meaningful way, particularly that selling people's data isn't the core of their business model.
That’s a stretch imo. Some companies whose entire business model relies on violating GDPR ignore it, and many companies haven’t had it enforced against them yet, but the vast majority of companies complied with the law without having to be penalized because the penalty is so high.
Nope. This proposal is a 5% fine on worldwide turnover, not net profit. That means if your hypothetical company traded only with Russia and had revenues of $10 million, they would pay $500,000 and have a $500,000 profit.
Of course it's extremely unlikely that any company in the EU only deals with Russia, so let's say that company had $10 million turnover in Russia but another $10 million in other countries throughout the world (even that number is so low to be extremely unlikely, but let's suppose). That company would pay the 5% fine on all revenues throughout the world, so the fine would now be $1 million.
