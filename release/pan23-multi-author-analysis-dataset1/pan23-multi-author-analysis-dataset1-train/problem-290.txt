Perhaps if they still campaigned as if it were a state by state contest. Strategies would have changed so there's no way to know what the outcome would have been.
Plus the strategy changes. If you're running, you just get your name out there earlier and through internet or social media. The state by state system made sense before the internet. It just doesn't make sense anymore. I never go to anything a politician is hosting in my state because I have to work all day. I get my info online.
If you're wondering how they mean, "easier for someone like Bernie Sanders to run", the argument is that by moving moderate SC to the forefront of the Democratic primary calendar, it would make it easier for a candidate who wanted to run in order to have a national conversation (about whatever) to run in NH without damaging an incumbent or another frontrunner like Biden.
There you go again. That’s a nice gun you have there at my head. This is a false dichotomy. You’re going to see a lot of positions similar to mine coming from the left in the 2024 general election.
