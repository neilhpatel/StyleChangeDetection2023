The Khmer Rouge was one of these Khmer parties that did not recognize Vietnamese control of these islands or the wider Mekong Delta. On May 1st, 1975, a group of Khmer Rouge soldiers invaded and occupied the island, but were quickly repelled by the Vietnamese. This was the first aggressive move in the conflict, but not the last. This prompted a series of broader border skirmishes across the Vietnamese-Cambodian border, and for a variety of reasons, a struggle within the Khmer Rouge where pro-Vietnamese or Vietnamese trained cadres were purged in 1976. Cambodia at the time was pro-China, while Vietnam was pro-USSR, and the Sino-Soviet split was ongoing, likely influencing this, but there's a lot of historical animosity, and Pol Pot at the time was trying to reestablish some nationalist vision of Angkor that did not allow for Vietnamese occupation of historical Khmer territory.
Okay, that makes sense then. I guess I forgot to consider how salted and battle hardened the army would have been at that point after 30 years of waging war.
