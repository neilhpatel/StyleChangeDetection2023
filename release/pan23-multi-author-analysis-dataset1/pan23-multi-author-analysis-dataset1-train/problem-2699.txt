Whether or not the landlord gave her a key, that is breaking and entering. YOU are currently in possession of the house, not your landlord. Your landlord can only let authorized people into your home without prior warning in emergency situations. And skunk spray doesn’t count as an emergency. I doubt you could get a cop to arrest her, but I would certainly tell your neighbor that you will report her to the police for breaking and entering if she doesn’t give you the key. I would tell your landlord that if she comes in and steals something that you will go after him personally in civil court. Let them decide whether that key is worth it.
If the neighbour has harassed you in any way you could if there is sufficient evidence be able to get a court order to stop her from trespassing or approaching you but you'd need the evidence to support that as you can't get a restraining order without having to move.
If your landlord was the one who gave permission for the neighbour to allow entry for the fire department into your apartment, then unfortunately there is no legal grounds to bring a case against anyone. The alternative would've been to let your house and your possessions burn down.
