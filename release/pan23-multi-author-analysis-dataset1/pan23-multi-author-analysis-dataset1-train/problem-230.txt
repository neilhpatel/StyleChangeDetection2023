Bad faith or not, the ranges can still be massive, especially for national or global companies that seek to comply by combining all regional ranges. Becomes very confusing for the seeker in many areas.
The bill also provides for complaint procedures, so I'm reading it like you can file a complaint if they try to claim "$30k to $300k", and then they would have to back it up by providing documentation that was a good faith salary range based on current and historical salaries that the company offers/offered for that position or a similar one.
This was my first thought as well. Just the other day, I came across a listing that said, "Between 70k and 180k.".
We need to stop thinking that as a capitalist society in a democracy we shouldn't be telling people how to run their part of the world the United States is large it's not the same thing as a European nation, what happens in Washinon sometimes has no effect on what happens in the south or the Pacific Northwest simply due to size.
It depends on the job range. But for a company that posts a business analyst role, and that role can be anywhere in the US for instance, that company has letâ€™s say 6 pay zones and they are open to 2 or 3 different levels of experience, sure, the range can easily be 60-180k.
