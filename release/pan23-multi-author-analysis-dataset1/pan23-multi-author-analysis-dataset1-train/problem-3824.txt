I guess I'm just confused because it appears that he was supposed to have full coverage on the vehicle before it even left the lot but they failed to verify that. They didn't request a waiver that names the dealership as additional "loss payee" or even ask for any proof of insurance. Its like they just took his word for it.
failure of an injured plaintiff to act prudently, considered to be a contributory factor in the injury suffered, and sometimes reducing the amount recovered from the defendant.
OMG Thank you SO much for taking all this time to help me. I don't pretend to be smart but I do have some understanding of basic agreements and this whole thing just felt fishy to me. It's impossible to talk to them because they are skilled in bending the truth and making you feel pressured into something. And so far my experience with trying to work with them has been very much good guy / bad guy vibes wherein one employee is sympathetic but not budging and the general manager has been confrontational and always accusatory and threatening. I will make one last ditch effort to negotiate but if they are insisting on recovering the full amount I will have no choice but to let it go before a judge and hope for the best. I can't tell you how much you put my mind at ease. I truly truly appreciate it. Thank you so very much.
Luckily for your son, the contingency addendum states very clearly that the sales agreement gets canceled automatically if the financing is not approved. Furthermore, if the sales agreement is canceled, the buyer's only duty, as dictated by NH law, is to "return the motor vehicle to the retail seller.".
P.S. On second thought, maybe start with $500. If they think their position is weak, they might just take it. A bird in hand...
