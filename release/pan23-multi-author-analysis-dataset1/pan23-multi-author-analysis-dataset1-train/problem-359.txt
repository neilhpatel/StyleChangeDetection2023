I think it's unlikely but possible if my ex brother in law signed up because he's untrustworthy. I was thinking of contacting SNAP to check if there was anything under my name in 2018. If it's the case that they didn't use my info I know snap has a pretty bad policy about overpayments and was told sometimes they go after the wrong member.
Yes, I was paraphrasing, but it states: "The reason for the overpayment is Household Income and this has been recorded as a(n) Unintentional Household Error claim.".
There have definitely been posts here before about these kind of letters before, I'm not familiar with the relevant law offhand but there are definitely circumstances where they can try to recover certain benefits from everyone listed on the household application.
Yes, I will do that! The letter states I have 90 days to request an appeal so there is no date yet. I just need to figure out if they used my name and info. There's a number to contact the office that has the records for the claim as well.
