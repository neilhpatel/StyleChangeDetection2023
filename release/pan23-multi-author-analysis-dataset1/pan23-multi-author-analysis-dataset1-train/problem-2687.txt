But Ron DeSantis and Larry AARRRNNN (a surname obviously derived from the disgusted sounds people make upon meeting the malignant spawn of that particulargene pool) want you to think racism was solved in the 60s and MLK just wanted "colorblindness.".
Most primary sources going back to the origin of abolitionism in the US fall foul of Florida law, even MLK discusses topics in some of his books that would offended the delicate sensibilities of modern conservatives. Likewise even an innocuous passage from James Baldwin would be stigmatized by subtext.

The College Board is a bullshit organization that has a virtual monopoly on many education related products, including standardized testing and financial aid applications. Itâ€™s been accused of violating its nonprofit status and paying its leadership enormous salaries and compensation. The fact that they caved is not in the least surprising.
