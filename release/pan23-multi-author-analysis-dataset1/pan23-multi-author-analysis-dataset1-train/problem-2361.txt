In February 1972, police managed to locate the organization's hideout, and five members escaped to a lodge at Mount Asana and took the wife of the lodge-keeper hostage. There was a nine-day standoff, a considerable amount of it being broadcast on TV. On the tenth day the police (assisted by a wrecking ball and tear gas) did an eight-hour assault where two policemen were killed in the ensuing gun battle. (The members of the group were captured alive, and the hostage was rescued.).
2.) Neo-Tokyo of the futuristic year 2019, was, in a sense, real Tokyo -- the decade Katsuhiro Otomo just lived through, combined with the post-WWII he originally grew up in.
It was in this environment, one year later, that Katsuhiro Otomo graduated high school from the small city of Tome and arrived in Tokyo, and published his first work that same year (a manga adaptation of a 19th century French short story). After starting in science fiction in 1979 and working on the acclaimed D≈çmu from 1980 to 1981, he embarked on Akira in 1982.
fantastic! when i saw the thread title i didn't expect to see any answer here so thanks for delivering. it's always been one of my favorite movies and it still stands up as one of the most rich and compelling films i've ever seen. if you have any interesting facts about the soundtrack i'd love to hear them as well. that OST is phenomenal. when i last saw it in theater it was loud to the point of physical pain but i loved it.
