Err...? "All answers and answer documents you submit including all essay responses, portfolios, and audio or visual work are owned by the College Board".
“All answers and answer documents you submit including all essay responses, portfolios, and audio or visual work are owned by the College Board, and these may be used by the College Board for any purpose..”.
Bad advice. This appears to be a copyright transfer contract. The fact that OP registered her copyright (which is what I assume you mean) wouldn't prevent her from transferring it to someone else at a later time.
While it's unlikely that they would prevent OP from selling the submitted artwork, this may be a copyright transfer, in which case she would technically need permission from College Board to sell the artwork, or risk being sued for copyright infringement.
NAL. It's likely that such language is present to make it clear that you're giving the College Board permission to reproduce your work for various purposes like scoring, internal training, or marketing (their exams/services). They're not going to reproduce your work for sale to other people (as artwork; again, they could use it for marketing purposes). I also suspect they are unlikely to attempt to prevent you from selling your artwork (but again I'm not a lawyer, so hopefully an IP attorney will comment on this).
