For real. White supremacy is simply one of the many ideologies used to keep us fighting each other while we remain in social and economic oppression. People need to snap out of it if we want to leave the world better than we found it.
Definitely! And same. I only recalled some of it because we discussed it during a lecture this last year in a corporate strategy class I took which considered when/if it makes sense to try to expand into new markets.

Much of the resistance to and limitations on the New Deal in the 30s and 40s had to do with racism specifically, and a lot of the justification for tearing down the regulations and safety net has been either explicitly racist or dogwhistled; I occasionally run across old stories of people justifying a vote 'against their interests' (where their interests are implicitly assumed to be economic) by saying it'd hurt "them" more (where them clearly refers to minorities or black people in particular).
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Here in North America, racism has been foundational to White Culture (or lately I've been seeing it dogwhistled as "Western Civilization") and has persisted for well over 400 years both through periods of comparative economic and social equality and inequality. If people like you and I don't start calling out the racism AND the elements of our culture that allow it to persist, we WILL be part of the same cycle and same problem.
