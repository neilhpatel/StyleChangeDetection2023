Although it's somewhat outdated nowadays (its last edition was made around 1965), there is a two volume history of the kingdom called "The House of Seleucus", written by Bevan, which still works pretty well for a general introduction of the empire's political evolution, the reason being that serious studies on the Seleucid Empire were almost non existant for decades since this book was piblished.
For political developement of the kingdom, there's a very new three-volume history witten by John Grainger, who divides the developement of the empire in three stages, one for each book: "The Rise of the Seleukid Empire", from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 to that of Seleucus III in 223; "The Seleucid Empire of Antiochus III", from 223 to 187, undoubtedly, the best recorded period of seleucid history, and "The Fall of the Seleucid Empire", from 187, the date of Antiochus III's death, to the creation by Pompey of the roman province of Syria.
Lastly, if you're interested in some more particular matters, Grainger also has written a biography on Seleucus I, "Seleucus I, Constructing a Hellenistic Kingdom", and "The Cities of Seleukid Syria", studying how the seleucid monarchs turned Syria from a rural area to the densely -for Antiquity standards- populated, prosperous and urbanized region it became. I'd mention also Michael Taylor's "Antiochus the Great", a biography of the seleucid king we know the most of, basically, because of his war with Rome, Bar-Kochva's "The Seleucid Army", an in-depth study, as much as our scarce sources allow us, of the kingdom's military, and also Aperghis' "The Seleukid Royal Economy" which I haven't yet read, but I know to be worth doing so.
Woah I'm so happy someone like you came up seeing you posted something a few years ago. English is not my native language neither so I'll have to make the effort since i don't expect to find many of those if any translated to spanish. The content you provided me is more than enough, much appreciated!
