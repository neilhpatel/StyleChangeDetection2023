- Narrow worldview. Selfishness breeds selfishness, and if your first response to a potential solution is "What about MEEEEEEE" then you've become part of the problem. You don't own the road in front of your house and private enterprise isn't going to magically fix that for you. That doesn't register with rural voters because they've been told all their lives that they have to do for themselves (something-something-bootstraps), and since they've believed it for so long even though it stopped being true generations ago, it enables conservative lawmakers to redirect tax money to more lucrative places. How do I know they're conservative lawmakers? Because that's who rural people keep voting for.

- Lack of information, due to saturation-bombing of misinformation from--surprise!--conservatives. When one side still thinks these problems can be solved with reasoned debate about actual solutions, the other side shouts through a megaphone about how those solutions won't work because reasons. The megaphone wins because it's louder, not because the person behind it has any solutions of their own, as they never offer any.
