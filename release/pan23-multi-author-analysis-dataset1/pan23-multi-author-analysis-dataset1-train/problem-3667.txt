This is a complicated question, in part because it deals with such recent history, and there is a current incarnation of 'hippy' that tints how we read the idea of hippies back onto the 60s. Or, in plain English, what we think of as hippies today is not the same as what hippies were in the 60s, and this relates intimately to the question you're asking.
Yeah, I touched on the ambiguity of the Yippy relation to hippies a bit in one of my comments. I didn't want to get too exegetic in my first reply, but like I said in the comment, I think the Yippies self consciously used the aesthetic of hippy to draw radicalizing young people into their particular, esoteric version of anarchism. In the interview I linked, Jerry Rubin is riffing on having long hair, for example. As I recall Hoffman more or less said this himself.

I mentioned having left out the Merry Pranksters in one of my other comments; basically I just did it because my focus was on how the media focus on the Haight subculture transformed it, and I didn't want to get into a geneaology of influences on that subculture (Kesey but also the Beats) because I would have had to go hunting for more sources and I didn't expect this answer to be definitive.
