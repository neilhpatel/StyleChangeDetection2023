If you are paid to work from 8:30-5 and you are ready and available to work from 8:30 to 5, I find it doubtful they could get back pay for that. I will be honest, I do a lot of Covid related employment work, but I have not delved into remote wage and hour issues yet. Hopefully an expert who has done this research comes along. But for now, what I can say is that I am very familiar with wage and hour stuff from a traditional perspective (people in the office with no work are still paid for those hours until fired) but I don’t know if there are any exceptions for work from home situations. I highly doubt they can get back pay from you, and if they did attempt to do so, I would certainly seek an attorney if they come at you for it and if you were ready and able to work, and always at your computer and responsive. The only thing I would worry about personally is being terminated because they don’t need you, but since you are employed by a temp agency, I’m sure they can find you a new assignment. The money you made is very likely just yours.
Florida. My legal question is: Can I get sued or asked for pay to be returned from days I wasn't assigned work, since my boss is aware I have no work to do (yet never told me to punch out or not to work).
