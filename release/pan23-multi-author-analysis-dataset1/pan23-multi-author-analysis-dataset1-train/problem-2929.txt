Between 1649 and 1653 Ireland suffered a 'demographic catastrophe', with an overall mortality rate in the region of 20 per cent. This was a consequence of the continuing violence, but also the widespread plague and famine which accompanied it. Some historians dispute the 20 percent figure on the basis that the pre-war population could not have been high enough, but there can be no doubt that Ireland in these years saw an absolute staggering amount of death. For comparison England saw an estimated 3 percent population loss during the Civil Wars of the 1640s. Cromwell played a part in this of course, leading the Parliamentary offensive and breaking Confederate resistance. The expulsion of the Irish from walled towns and the heavy levels of taxation placed upon local populations to support Parliamentary armies helped foster conditions which were ripe for famine and starvation. A writer in the 1680s referred to the famine of this period as ‘Cromwell’s pestilence’. However, Cromwell really played no more part in this than other Parliamentarian commanders regardless of his overbearing reputation.
If I may, I have a lot of other questions. What were the numbers sent abroad like, and how common was the transplanting and/or shipping abroad of defeated enemies in other European conflicts of the time? Was this usual/accepted practice, or something unique to Ireland?
