If you don't know German bureaucracy it's hard to grasp how much of a wonder this really is. Projects like this would normally take at least 10 years for all the permits and public contract competition process. Two more LNG terminals will shortly be opened as well and another one is being built. This is a matter of national economic security and if you will, survival. These terminals being finished in under a year just shows how important they are.
Very presumptuous. Russias been through worse and come through stronger. Irresponsible to just assume it’s not a threat because of the current situation in Ukraine.
Absolutely! As bad as the energy prices are this is where the market is working to change our ways and invest more in renewable energy, making us less dependent on foreing imports for good. But sometimes the solution is very complex.
potentially or realistically? because honestly i don't think germany would ever manage to get over petty ideological squabbling between and inside of parties. the only times most parties actually worked together, is when the right-wing afd had opinions about any topic and everyone grouped up to disagree. also some parties think doing nothing until it is too late is better than trying something and finding out it was a mistake. so... yeah.
The term bureaucracy refers to a complex organization that has multilayered systems and processes. The systems and processes that are put in place effectively make decision-making slow. They are designed to maintain uniformity and control within the organization.
