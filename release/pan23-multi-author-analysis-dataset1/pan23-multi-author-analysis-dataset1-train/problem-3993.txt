OK, so this is going to be a complicated one, but just to start, I'm going to push back on your idea that poor whites predominantly live in rural areas, and poor minorities live in inner cities. This was true a few decades ago, but . In raw numbers, suburban poverty is the most common form of poverty in America today. (This violates the 20-year rule, but it's necessary to clear up the misconception.).
Furthermore, Asian Americans on the West Coast faced a cutoff of additional immigration through the Chinese Exclusion Act and US-Japan "Gentlemen's Agreement", laws prohibiting Asian immigrants from naturalizing as citizens, and prohibiting such Asian immigrants from owning land. Even when Asian Americans such as the Japanese berry farmers were able to work around such obstacles to establish themselves in farming country, the gains were delicate, as was seen when these farm owners were interned along with other Japanese Americans during World War II.
More than that. The policies formalized and reinforced that racist reality in a moment when home ownership was growing and becoming an important way for Americans to build wealth.
