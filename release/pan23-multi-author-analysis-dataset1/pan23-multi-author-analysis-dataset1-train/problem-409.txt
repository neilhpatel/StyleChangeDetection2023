My father and grandparents are from Mexico, and my grandparents moved back to their home city of Reynosa a few years back. It's bad. I would definitely call it a failed state. Nonstop violence, rampant corruption in government and law enforcement. They've just accepted hearing gunshots every night as a fact of life. It's pretty sad.
Not sure why you can't respond to me but unfortunately like all social media the top page of subreddit is always going to be what's most popular, you may not being particularly interested in hearing about the Russia VS Ukraine war but to alot of people it is what is most important to them.
I agree 100%. There are plenty of areas in the US that the government seems to have no control over. I love living here and also spent 2 weeks in Mexico recently. I felt no danger and stayed out late at night several times. Sensational headlines are just that. Mexico has areas where you need to be more vigilant, just like many countries in this world. Anyone whose says otherwise is lying or has no first hand experience.
