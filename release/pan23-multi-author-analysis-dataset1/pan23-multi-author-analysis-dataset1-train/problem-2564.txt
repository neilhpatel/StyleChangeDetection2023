My mother retired from healthcare management in Newfoundland 5 years ago. She spent the last 15 years of her career trying to solve these problems that everyone could clearly see coming. Her organization restructured like 4 or 5 times over her career. Each time they flushed out useless people and got much more efficient. They have been focusing on recruiting for 20 years. Knowing that most of their professionals were going to retire soon. Many professionals continue to work long past when they can retire thankfully. But events like COVID have made it a very acute problem. For everyone who was hanging on long past retirement age it was the "straw that broke the camels back".
I'm not in Canada and i don't know what specific political or sociologic point you are trying to make, so please don't think i'm trying to take some kind of sides politically or something; but hypothetically speaking, if a large percentage of those immigrants were medical experts, that actually theoretically could help Canada's overwhelmed medical system. It would be like importing extra doctors and nurses.
