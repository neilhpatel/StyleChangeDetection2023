Its literally supply and demand in action. As the population of workers drops relative to the number of jobs, then the cost of labor goes up, since each individual laborer has more options. IF you flood the market with cheaper labor, you can create downward pressure on wages. While its great to keep prices down and get more workers, it kind of screws the people who would otherwise take advantage of the tight labor market.
It's demographics. People working versus not working, by age. So as population declines, there is an unbalanced number of older people who don't work but still need services. The shortage is the younger people who work.
Oh and I'm getting tired of western countries playing the immigration card for damn near everything - there are certainly benefits but instead of investing in training, education, and paying more so the nation's population can fill the gaps at living wages, many western countries just poach talent for (relatively) cheap labor, depressing wages for citizens while failing to address training and education their own people.
2. I have a friend who runs a surveying company. He can't hire new grads because he pays $2500 a month to start. He has said that he has been told that it isn't enough.
Notable too that the tech industry has been on absolute fire because of growth companies in the inflationary cycle, there's a reason big tech has been doing TONS of layoffs disproportionate to the market recently, and why the number of openings rose so quickly in the last 2 to 3 years (and it's not just remote work/covid.).
