The center was built in the 90s. The first class of trainees (active duty military members) were housed on campus, which meant they had a cafeteria (galley) for all their meals. For whatever reason, the dining facility could only serve about a third to half of the trainees for every meal, which is not how it's supposed to be, obviously. There weren't other options nearby, not even vending machines, so at least half these guys (mostly young men straight out of high school) were going hungry, and it was impacting their training. One of the instructors asked them why they were distracted/tired/whatever, and they told him it was because they couldn't eat.
