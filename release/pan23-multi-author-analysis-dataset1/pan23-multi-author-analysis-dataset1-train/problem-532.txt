This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard, if this is even remotely true I hope your friend doesn’t get caught because they’re committing fraud and could be sued for back wages by the company. This is also just extremely incorrect info at every level. No company that has a job that actually needs a degree doesn’t checkup on it. I’ve never seen a company but use a background checking service before making a hire unless it was some minimum wage highschool job or a small mom and pop family owned business and none of those are making remotely 150k unless you’re the mom and pop.
And its been true the entire time. The elderly are out of touch with what the young need and want and need to be forced to get out of the damn way. It was true for our parents, it's true for us and when our time comes it will be true for our children. If they arent willing to retire and stop fucking up our world with outdated ideas and views they need to be forced to.
