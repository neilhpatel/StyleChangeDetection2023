There were several reasons why ships were built much more quickly during WWII than they were later in the 20th Century. A major one was that far more people were employed in the shipbuilding industry during the war than during the 1990s. At the peak of the wartime industry, some 89,300 people were employed by shipyards primarily building warships, with another 44,100 working to repair and convert ships. Another 102,400 people were employed building or repairing merchant vessels. To this must be added workers in similar trades; the Royal Navy's dockyards employed 36,700 people, and 88,900 worked in marine engineering. For comparison, in 1999, there were only 27,500 people working in the entirety of the British shipbuilding and repair sector, a tenth of those working in wartime. To this must be added workers elsewhere in the British Empire. Canadian yards were the largest, employing over 82,000 men and women at peak employment in 1943. Australian yards were smaller, but still built some 113 ships for the Royal Australian Navy, as well as providing repair facilities for the USN and RN. The availability of this mass of manpower meant that much of the labour-intensive work of shipbuilding could be done at speed. Constructing a 'River'-class frigate took between 350,000 and 400,000 man-hours. An example yard that built them was Yarrows Ltd's Canadian yard at Esquimalt, which employed 2,470 people. Assuming Yarrows built ships one at a time, with the full workforce working on a single ship and using the upper bound of 400,000 man-hours, it would take the yard just under 162 hours (roughly a week) per ship. This is, of course, an unrealistic estimate (the fastest 'River' built in a Canadian yard took 5 months and 3 days to construct), but it is indicative of the speed of construction that could be achieved by leveraging manpower.
This is not. I simply looked down the ship list and made an incorrect assumption, and thank you for educating me. I will look more into this to fill this gap in my knowledge.
By 1940 and 1941, this meant FDR had ordered the Navy to forceably bend all sorts of non-belligerent rules in terms of convoys and areas of responsibility (pushing the boundaries of 'neutrality' patrols all the way to Iceland was certainly interesting, especially after orders came down to shoot first if threatened) to try to get more cargo through, but with yards full for warship construction, the British realized the only hope of getting more capacity was to come hat in hand to the Canadians and the United States and try to buy cargo ships.
