Scientific racism (very briefly) was the belief that race is an innate biological concept that can be explained evolutionarily. It originated in the 18th century as early naturalists and anthropologists placed humans within the animal kingdom and differentiated them by "species." As these ideas grew more popular, it became more and more accepted to not just classify the races by their appearances and biological characteristics but to rank them, whether in terms of their intelligence, their beauty (particularly that of their women), their hygiene, and their ability to be productive members of society, among other things, and as Darwinian evolution became accepted, it soon was incorporated to give a feeling of urgency to the situation- that the races were competing with each other and that lesser races could "pollute" higher ones. These ideas became popular enough that they became influential on government policies in the US and elsewhere- immigration policy, sterilization policies, and anti-miscegenation laws, among others, were clearly and heavily influenced by scientific racism and eugenics to the extent that scholars generally consider that Nazi Germany was heavily influenced by the US in this matter.
Can you shed any light on Fitzgerald's attitudes on race when he wrote Tender is the Night? I read it recently and he depicts Dick Diver as becoming increasingly bigoted as he descends deeper into his moral and professional decline. The novel shows Americans (such as Dick and Abe North) show disdain for supposedly "inferior races" even as they sucumb to their own demise through materialism and hedonism.
Thank you! Unfortunately I really don't know much about Burroughs beyond seeing him remarked on in some of the works I consulted as someone who bought into this particular movement.
