I'm a tour guide in the Black Forest, and the region has been a source of a specific kind of trees for a very long time, the (Weiß-Tanne). The trees were cut in the Black Forest, moved down the rivers very carefully, collected in the Rhine, tied together into and very carefully moved down the river to the Netherlands, where they were used for building ships, the foundations of Amsterdam and casks.
Here's where this connects to nautical folklore: When moving the Dutchman Trees down the rivers in spring, they cleared the sides of the rivers as best as possible because the logs were very dangerous. Traditionally, the Black Forest lumberjacks built lakes that filled over the wintertime, so in spring they could open the reservoirs, turning the small streams into rapid torrents for a few days to deliver the logs down the flanks of the mountain. As you can imagine, having 50 foot long logs go down a mountainside in overflowing rivers was dangerous and sometimes the Dutchman Trees jumped out of the river, those were known as "Fliegende Holländer", or Flying Dutchmen.
I hope your response can remain. It is, in fact, very interesting. It is an example of what is known as a "folk etymology." The motif of the Flying Dutchman is not likely generated from this logging practice. Instead, it is more likely that the name "Flying Dutchman" back fed, encouraged by the coincidence of the name "Dutchman Trees," and so the nautical tradition inspired a folk etymology in the other direction - a local belief that the nautical name came from this local practice, a belief not likely supported by fact. I appreciate your contribution very much.
