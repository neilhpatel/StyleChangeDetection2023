Not where I live. Also, Job Corps trains at risk youth in trades, mostly contruction, and those folks are predominantly (like 95%) people of color, and they graduate with jobs lined up. Maybe for people like Pete Butt whatever who grew up in rich as fuck semi rural Indiana you only see white people, but I assure you that is not the case in Pittsburgh, Philly, Baltimore, etc.

Republican news is very centrically organized. If you tune into Fox you'll hear very similar things that you'd hear/see on Newsmaxx, OANN, Brietbart, The Blaze, AM Radio. They're pushing the same narratives because they're working with the GOP to reach the same goals. Outside of some individual programs, there is not much in the way of right-wing news that is credible and happens to have a slight conservative bias. It's almost all propaganda.
