Like any big city, Rome was both a single idea and infinitely splintered reality - each street part of a system, every neighborhood a building block of the metropolis. And as in any big city, the ways its inhabitants experienced part and whole must have varied. Unfortunately, despite all the vivid detail provided by the letters of Cicero and the epigrams of Martial and Juvenal, our literary sources really tell us only how Roman elites liked to think and talk about life in Rome - potentially a very different thing from lived experience. Archaeology brings us closer to the sweat and dirt, but often merely in the sense of establishing the essentials of the physical setting. Your question, in other words, ain't easy to answer. But I'll take a wild stab at it.
It looks to me like the downtown of, say, Kansas City, but apparently there are roughly four times the residents and daytime population which would be in proportion to the relative populations of the cities. Wikipedia claims 85,000 residents and over 500,000 people working there, in 5.84 sq. mi.
Rome's density was not planned - with the brief exception of the period after the great fire of 64, the imperial government made no attempts to intervene in the city's layout - and seems to have been nothing more or less than an organic consequence of high rents and high demand for housing.
Wait. 5 miles^2 or 13 km^2 would mean Rome had a population density of over 70,000 per km^2. How does a city without skyscrapers have a population density more than twice that of the densest modern city?
