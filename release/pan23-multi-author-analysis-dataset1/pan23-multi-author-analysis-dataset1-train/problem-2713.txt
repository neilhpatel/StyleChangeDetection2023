But coming back around. It's my understanding China just wants to do business. USA has been pissing on that. I think that's the big hang up right now.

“China’s state-owned defense companies have shipped navigation equipment and parts to fighter jets and other military technology equipment to Russian defense companies, according to Russian customs data.” I understand longing for more details, especially from modern journalism, but that kind of information will realistically not be readily available for the general public, especially regarding highly sensitive technologies.
Neither. The realistic situation is that China is a world power unto itself and doesn’t face the false dichotomy you’re painting. China is hugely interdependent with the United States and it will not intentionally burn that bridge, but China is also a proud nation that cannot be seen to be acting as a puppet of the United States, so it will deal with Russia in ways that demonstrate it’s independence without incurring a response from the U.S.
I lean towards a group of researches staying very, very quiet. USA has it. China says it's meteorological. USA says it's surveillance. Someone's story is going to have to change next week.
There is a bounty of ambiguity in the description of the equipment we have here and there are absolutely valid defensive applications for many weapons systems. It is my contention that if Forbes had evidence of China enabling Russia's invasion of Ukraine it would gladly publish that evidence.
