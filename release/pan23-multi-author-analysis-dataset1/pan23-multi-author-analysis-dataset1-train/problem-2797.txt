Other DeSantis-inspired bills have been introduced by Republican state lawmakers in Georgia, Nebraska, Indiana and beyond. From the Mountain West to the Deep South, Florida-style bills are springing up in state legislatures, signaling the growing influence of DeSantis as an ideological leader for a Republican Party that had been shaped in the image of former president Donald Trump.
The state-policy debates underscore how Florida now rivals Texas as a laboratory for conservative policies, giving Republican legislators elsewhere a model for how to turn their principles on contentious social issues into law.

Meanwhile, PEN America, a freedom of expression advocacy group, has so far identified 81 proposals that it believes are an attempt to stifle creativity and academic freedom in education. About 20 of those proposals appear to be nearly a “carbon copy” of a law enacted last year in Florida that bans LGBTQ topics from elementary school classrooms, said Jeremy Young, senior manager of free expression and education at PEN America.
GOP lawmakers in the Equality State have introduced a proposal to ban references to sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, replicating chunks of a controversial law that DeSantis implemented in Florida. A separate Republican-sponsored bill would hold librarians and teachers criminally liable should a student be exposed to obscene reading materials, also taking a cue from DeSantis’s agenda some 2,000 miles away.
