Yep! I live in a heavy RED state, and even our midterm percentages were closer than usual. GOP still ran a clean sweep as usual, but the margins are closer than ever before.

Exactly! Back in the day republicans were people who I had basic disagreements with, mostly on taxation. Now they’re freaking fascists hell bent on restricting personal freedoms like abortion and lgbtq rights and denying elections. Is it any wonder that most younger folks want nothing to do with that? Discrimination and hate aren’t strong selling points.
Millennial here. I don’t always agree with the progressive wing of the Democrats, but it really feels like they’re the only ones who are trying to engage seriously with the actual problems that regular people are facing in America today. I’d rather have well-meaning elected officials who get it wrong sometimes than religious authoritarians or centrists who are pathologically incapable of doing anything more than fiddling on the margins.
Yeah, I have a pretty large group like that where I work also. A lot of them just don't vote ironically enough. They have the typical young voter apathy where they share FB memes and whatnot, but don't actually go and vote.
