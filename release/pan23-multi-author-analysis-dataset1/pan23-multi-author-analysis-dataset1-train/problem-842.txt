From the moment the Russian advance was stopped south of Mykolaiv in the spring, the invaders’ position on the west bank was obviously strategically vulnerable. But it has taken a careful three-month campaign to force the Kremlin to conclude it cannot hang on, beginning with the targeting of Russian logistics on both sides of the river with Himars and other longer range rocket artillery and which turned to targeting strategic bridges and then the pontoons that the Russians had to built to resupply their forces in the cross-river pocket.
Me reading this: "Wait... what the...?" I was gonna say that Russia steals the most random-ass shit when they loot the places they're retreating from, but then I looked him up and now it makes sense. Dude annexed Crimea in 1783, so Putin annexed it in 2014. Dude used 1783 weapons, Putin used... weapons that were just about as good as what they had in 1783. I see where Putin went wrong here.
But Ukraine will want to disrupt the Russian retreat as much as possible, capturing soldiers and above all equipment – turning the withdrawal into something like the near rout that took place in September when Russia made a similar decision, to withdraw from near Kharkiv and Izium in the northern part of the front to behind the Oskill river, in an attempt, only partially successful, to consolidate its position into the late autumn and early winter.
