I'd like to start a whole movement pointing out that Christians also have the whole "I give to you and your descendents this land" bit in the bible, and argue that we've got just as much right to Israel as a bunch of people whose families had pretty much been living in Europe for centuries.
It is just a real-estate deal that ended. actually really boring stuff, and not unexpected either, everyone knew when the lease was ending. And it was not even Jews that ended the lease, but the palestinians will take any opportunity, or make one up to try and blame Israel and the Jews for anything. (There is even a story of a pro-palestinian calling an Israeli racist because Israelis don't rape Israeli women. ).
On December 27th, members of the Elad settler organisation, accompanied by Israeli police, took over a property in the area of Wadi Hilweh/Silwan which has been rented for decades by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate to a Jerusalem tenant.
Thats it. Nothing special. Nothing related to Christian grounds or settling. In fact, christians dont live in that neighborhood. The palestinians are using their media to attempt and direct a certain non existent narrative, and their followers (like OP) are aiding it. Just it. A little bit of context always place things in perspective.
