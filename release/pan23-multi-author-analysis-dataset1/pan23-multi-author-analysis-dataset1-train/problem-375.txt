ADDED: this could even be beneficial. The Pentagon/DOD could then record EACH ballot received, by state/county and service member serial number, so be able to respond appropriately when any service member receives multiple ballots, maybe from multiple states/counties, for a given election.
Wouldn't the most intelligent way to handle mailing absentee ballots to individual service members be for the state or county to mail ballots to the Pentagon with service members' serial numbers (presumably NOT confidential personal information since the Geneva Conventions requires captured military personnel to give their captors their serial number; if enemies of the US could know serial numbers, surely the USPS could know serial numbers). The Pentagon would then route those ballots to those service members' bases or off-base home addresses. Service members could return their ballots through ordinary mail.
