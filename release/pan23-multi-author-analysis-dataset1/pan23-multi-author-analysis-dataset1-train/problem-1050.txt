In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly. The law should be objective, not subjective. It should be applied strictly, not liberally. You can't have everyone viewed equally under the law when the law is flexible.

The problem with an automatic approval means the president could just keep putting forward highly undesirable candidates that they know wonâ€™t get passed (even getting their own party to vote against approval) until they get their automatic approval for whoever they actually wanted in, which is even worse, as it could entirely negate the importance of the the approval process.
Yes exactly. All of the issues you're describing are issues with sentencing and broad laws, where making the laws broader and more flexible to allow prosecutors to charge more people would make things much, much worse. Broadly written three strikes laws that treat all convictions the same. Broad laws that give unethical judges broad authority for sentencing. And for example, the current state of this case.
