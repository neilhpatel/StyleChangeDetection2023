'The relations of satirists to the law have always been delicate and complex. Both Horace and Juvenal took extraordinary pains to avoid entanglements with authorityâ€”Juvenal ends his first satire with the self-protective announcement that he will write only of the dead. In England in 1599 the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London issued an order prohibiting the printing of any satires whatever and requiring that the published satires of Joseph Hall, John Marston, Thomas Nashe, and others be burned.'.
Another ecclesiastical text which deals with abortion is the Collectio canonum Hibernensis, composed in the late seventh or early eighth century. This text quotes patristic scholars such as Jerome about abortion. Jerome is very negative about abortion and writes about nuns who end up dying from the potions they drink in attempts to abort. He condemns them as "suicides, adulterers against Christ and parricides of their unborn children". (Nuns were considered in a sense "married" to Christ, hence the claim about adultery.) There were other penitentials circulating in Europe at the time which similarly considered abortion to be the murder of children, such as that attributed to Halitgar of Cambrai, which considered the apothecaries who sold abortion potions as the killers of children. So while learned Irish people were certainly exposed to very negative views about abortion and copied texts in which these views appeared, in their own legal system, it was considered negative but was not treated with the same severity as the murder of a baptized child.
