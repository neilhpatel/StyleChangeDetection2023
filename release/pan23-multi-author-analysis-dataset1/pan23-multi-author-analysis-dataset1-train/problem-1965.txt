It is really interesting that the story is based on real expeditions, I will definitely check them out. Do you know any sources i could check?
Sorry, without context it probably sounded like a personal judgment, the way there certainly was a prejudice against women who "couldn't" get married, were widowed (as one of Lovecraft's aunts, Lillian Delora Clark, née Phillips, was), or had a "failed" marriage (as Lovecraft's other aunt, Annie Emeline Gamwell, née Phillips, had, as she separated from her husband but was never formally divorced from him). I mentioned that they were unmarried to stress that, without families of their own (Lillian was childless, while Annie had two children: one died shortly after birth, and the other died in 1916), they spent quite a lot of time with Lovecraft, and had a huge influence on him, especially after his mother died in 1921 (they are partly blamed by Joshi, among others, for the "failure" of Lovecraft's own marriage). Towards the end of his life, Lovecraft ended up living with his aunts in a small house, all in financial difficulty.
