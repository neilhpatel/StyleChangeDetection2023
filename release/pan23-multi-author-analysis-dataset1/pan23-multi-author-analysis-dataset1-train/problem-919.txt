That's just Luka saying "yeah, Putin, I'm totally with you on this, and I'll send my army to join yours real soon nowâ„¢, when these warmongering homonazis invade us to steal our traditional Slavic values, just as y'all were saying on TV for the past few years. Must be any day now.".
What I can see occurring if Russia drops a tactical nuke in Ukraine as a final warning, is that no, the West would not retaliate militarily at least with nukes, virtually all of Russia's allies (except for North Korea) would condemn this suicidal move and distance themselves from Russia, especially China, who has already warned Russia to avoid nuclear escalation.
Bingo. Belarus only has a population of under 10 million, less than a quarter than that of Ukraine and less than 1/14th that of Russia(prewar), with a far weaker military than either, as well as a much less stable domestic position than Putin, Belarus is in no position for an invasion of Ukraine.
Considering that Belarus has like 1/14th of Russia's population, a far weaker military, and there actually is a somewhat stronger opposition, this could just be bluster to keep Kremlin and the hawks happy or a distraction to draw some Ukrainian troops away from the main front.
