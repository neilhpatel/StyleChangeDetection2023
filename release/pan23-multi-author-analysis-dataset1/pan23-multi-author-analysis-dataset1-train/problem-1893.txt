I never thought of this. And in all fairness the bra was the same color and at first I thought it was mine as well until I noticed the brand tag was different. That seems like a more likely possibility considering his number of roommates, etc. This diffused my instinctual anger/spite towards him for the incident quite a bit, so thanks for sharing this different perspective. It definitely helps hearing from someone who relates to the issue directly as well and has had similar experiences. If anything it’s a lesson learned for the future. Thank you for this .
It’s very possible that somewhere in those 2 months, another woman left her bra and an honest mistake was made wherein he returned the wrong bra to her (resulting in him trying to give you hers when you came to pick your bra up). Or perhaps in those two months he (or even one of his roommates) had another hookup who stole your bra and left hers (expensive lingerie goes missing a lot in shared housing situations because it’s so easy to steal being small and hidden under clothes).
NAL but you knew where it was the entire time. You had ample opportunity to pick it up over the past 2 months. You say he travels a lot so he's not home but you say he also has numerous roommates. You could have told him to have one of his roommates give it to you if he was out of town.
