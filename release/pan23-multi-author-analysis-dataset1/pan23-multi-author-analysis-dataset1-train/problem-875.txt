It is questionable as to whether or not you could be charged with a crime. It is in the realm of possibility, especially if you had just left money on the table or otherwise didn't settle a bill. It is theoretically possible that it meets the statutory definition of an offense to order food that you do not ultimately purchase, but it would come down to specifics and assuming you left money intended to cover the drinks, is probably not worth pursuing by the prosecutor.
Is this right? So in theory one could order hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of expensive food from a restaurant, never come to pick it up, and incur no legal obligation whatsoever to pay for the food even after it was prepared?
Yup. My suspicion is that OP didn't go to the register or speak with the server/manager prior to leaving, and just left money on the table (or similar.) This makes it so that there's more of an argument for it meeting the definition of a criminal offense. For example, if they left without telling the server, the server could have assumed they stepped out and delivered their food, etc.
