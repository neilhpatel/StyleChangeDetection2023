The ultimate issue in situations like this is does the other side have the means to pay a judgment if you get it. There's likely no applicable insurance policies (meaning deeper pockets) to pull from in a situation like this. So, any judgment would be paid from his own personal finances. You also have to balance that with the issue that if he doesn't have a lot of money, you're likely are going to be paying an attorney and all costs associated with that. If you're legally alleging in a lawsuit that he's caused you severe emotional distress, it's your burden to prove that in a court of law. In order to meet that burden and evidentiary requirements to introduce evidence of the like, it's most likely going to take the efforts and analysis of at least one mental health expert. Legal experts can get expensive. It may just not be financially feasible to sue him even if you have a potential case.
If you want to do a lawsuit, there's something you need to realize about a lawsuit. It's only intended function is to get you monetary compensation. It won't heal rifts between friends. (And honestly, if they quit being friends with you because of what someone else said without confirming it with you, were they ever really your friends at all?) It doesn't have the ability to change opinions.
i'm not able to see what he posts anymore about me, because he's had me blocked since we broke up and kicked me from the group he does most of his posting about me in (some of it he does on his main facebook), i've only been hearing about it secondhand through people who are still associated with that social group. would that be an issue for sending a cease and desist or getting a protection order? would he legally be obligated to share what he's posted about me if i get a lawyer?
