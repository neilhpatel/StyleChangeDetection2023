In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Absolutely. Aboriginal would probably be a better term. Most people probably don't think about the different meaning of those words. Even Neanderthals evolved in Africa, but migrated to Europe long before other hominids.
Propaganda? Where did Native Americans come from originally? Or were they always in North/South America? Look it up and get back to me.
Finally... I think about the only thing any person on this planet can say they're truly indigenous to is Earth itself.

It’s technically accurate. First Nations people moved here from Asia, they didn’t evolve here. The term indigenous gets used for people that have lived in a place for a long time even though the word means something else. He’s still an ass for what he’s doing, but that isn’t actually wrong.
We don’t have the proper objective historical perspective to be analyzing, framing, and contextualizing modern presidents/current events. Those are topics for other classes. History classes don’t need to do more than mention this stuff superficially at the end, if at all. Weaving current events into your narrative of history is not really teaching history. It’s teaching your opinion.
