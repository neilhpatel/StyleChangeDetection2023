While Russians and Ukrainians are killing each other, Belarus is.. watching. Unbelievable how everyone underestimates Lukashenko.
ME at 3:39 lol. We are so caught up in the current moment and the news and current regimes. We are all humans, we are all ALIVE (somehow, against all odds) on this oasis hurtling through space. We have to find some way to remember that. That guy gets it.
Immediately afterward, there would be a three-way civil war in Belarus between pro-Russian, pro-EU, and pro-independence/nationalist factions, and the Russian contingent there would bleed themselves dry trying to win it.
It was hard to watch him... I understand the seed, though. He sees the defiance of Ukraine as a political play for the states. He isn't wrong, but he also isn't right... It just makes me sad for our species.
Russian troops are already in Belarus; if Russia invaded then they would have Lukashenko in chains on a flight to Moscow within hours and would quickly appoint a replacement president who enthusiastically supports annexation.
ugh, you couldn't be more wrong. Lukashenko has been overpromising Putin and underdelivering for 20 years. French media refers to him as the most shrewd politician in east europe for a good reason. What's with Redditors thinking Lukashenko is some kind of idiot when he's Europe's longest-serving ruler, before Putin was in power.
