That’s pretty sobering but to not intervene in a Taiwan invasion would be the end of Pax Americana and the current rules based world order. China would control high end chips and could then throttle western economies with this control should they somehow manage to capture Taiwan’s TSMC facilities intact or partially intact. Even if the facilities were destroyed, it would take the world at least a decade to recover from the loss of Taiwan’s chip production, even if the entire staff relocated to another country to build new fabs.
Yeah. But that day there was videos of strikes on russian AA. And the main thing is not that it was destroyed, but that it was HARM (of course, you can take as many pictures of the wreckage as you want, but still).
Human society is based on competition, not cooperation. I think we'll still need a few hundred years of development before the masses start to wonder why over 99% of the wealth goes to less than 0.01% people, and wonder what life would be like if they only needed to work 6 hours a week to pay for food, healthcare and homes.
