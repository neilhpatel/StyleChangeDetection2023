So it’s November 9 1989 and I am a resident of Tbilisi in Soviet Republic of Georgia. I do not change a channel on the radio because there are no radio channels. There are no FM stations – those only appeared after the breakup of the USSR. Some people have AM radio receivers, which might be able get Radio Free Europe or Voice of America or maybe some stations from nearby countries, but there are no local channels. There is only one state radio channel, and it is broadcast in Tbilisi homes through a physical wire, which goes into an apartment and is connected to a small box with a loudspeaker. There are no knobs to change channels, as there are no channels. There is only a dial to regulate loudness.

Television (once again, in 1989 there were no channels to choose from. There was The TV – Georgian state broadcaster and Georgians could also receive Russian state channels) started showing some of the music videos. The most scandalous were and – both of which came out that year and both of which showed unprecedented amount of skin. You could even see Sabrina’s nipple!
At least some listeners could hear "Gruppa krovi" as being part of a pro-Soviet album, meditating on the heroic self-sacrifice of Soviet and especially Russian soldiers. For older Soviets who remembered WWII, this might be a familiar kind of tune. Others, however, hooked their ears on Kino's other lyrics that demanded change, and while Marxists theoretically support revolution, Kino got into some trouble especially for the song "Spokojnaya noch'" which urged audiences that "now the time had come." In one performance in Moscow in 1988, some excited audience members apparently started tipping over chairs, and the band was held responsible and the concert cut short.
