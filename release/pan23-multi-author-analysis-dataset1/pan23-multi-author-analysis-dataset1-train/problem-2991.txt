To clarify, it was meant as leverage over the neighbors. Getting all the ducks in a row so to speak."You came on my property and illegally installed a fence not to code that now has to be corrected and you expect me to pay anything for it? I'm well within my rights to restore it to the original condition and bill you for it.".
Realistically you can wait to see if your neighbor sues you in civil court for half the cost, and argue your case to the judge, saying that you didn't get adequate notice, nor input on styles and cost before this action happened unilaterally and then you got handed a bill.
I'm definitely not happy with the extra height. The new fence is also being built with the "ugly" side facing our yard, not alternating like the old fence. Unfortunately, removing the fence would put us in a worse place than where we started, because they also tore down the half of the fence that didn't need to be replaced.
We have pictures of the fence from before it fell over, and pictures of the good half after we rebuilt it a year and a half ago. In the past, we sort of alternated doing any minor fixes that were needed, with us doing more of the major fixes. The half that was rebuilt was 100% our cost, so we've already paid to fix half the entire fence.
