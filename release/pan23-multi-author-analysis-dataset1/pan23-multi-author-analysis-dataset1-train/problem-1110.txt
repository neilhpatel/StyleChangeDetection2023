I think regardless of how he came to being returned to Wagner, it’s unreal to see how low Russia has sunk. Executing someone with a sledgehammer is just medieval, and it’s one of their own people. Granted, he was a convicted murderer who “committed treason” by defecting to Ukraine, but no one deserves a death like that. This is some real mafia type shit. I know things in Russia are bad, but if people are getting away with committing summary executions like this things are only going to get worse. Much worse.
I usually shit on the American government and the values of some Americans, but you gotta admit giving back a piece of shit who has it easy in a 'murican prison in exchange for an innocent black woman in some shitty Gulag is a hell of a good deal and I'll be damned if sometimes America doesnt often show its ugly side but that's a great thing to do.
Paul Whelan. It just shows how uninformed you are, and the fact that you didnt even bother to look it up before commenting tells everything.
