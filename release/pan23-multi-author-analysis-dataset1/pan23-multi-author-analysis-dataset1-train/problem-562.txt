They also know that despite Russia being on the backfoot, Ukraine is suffering a devastating amount of economic loss. The war is on Ukrainian turf afterall and it's Ukrainian cities being wiped out. Russia wants to send the message, "yes we're bleeding, but so are you and we're willing to bleed as long as it takes to bleed you dry". (Whether that claim can be backed up is a different story).
You are from Luxembourg and I'm from Poltava Oblast (one of 24 oblasts of Ukraine) which by itself is more than 10 times larger than your country yet still your country finds ways to help us (by providing humvees and personnel for training our troops and maybe something more which I'm unaware) which blows my mind tbh because let's be honest, you are far away from Ukraine, well defended by surrounded NATO countries and you know well that russians will never get to you, but my guess is that you still probably have german occupation flashbacks from ww2 and you understand how important it is to be united against plain fascism and popular 'never again' slogan is not just words to you, so hats off to Luxemburg. ❤️❤️❤️ Believe me every country which helps us won't be forgotten by ukrainians.
