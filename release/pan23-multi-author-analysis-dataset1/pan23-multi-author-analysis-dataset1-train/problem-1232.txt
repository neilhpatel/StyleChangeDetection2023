I'm another vet and If you already had a VA loan it is possible to get what's called a IRRL refinance. This is designed to allow a veteran to quickly refinance the loan WITHOUT a lot of the checks and things that are required without standard mortgage. You don't even need to submit proof of income or get a new property assessment. I feel like they abused the system in order to obtain the mortgage on your property. I get your frustration about not being able to find a lawyer to help you with this so I have two suggestions. The first is to notify your congressman or senator and ask to speak to their veterans liaison. They can most likely put pressure on the VA which could help you in this situation. The other thing you should do is start looking for veterans service organizations, the big ones here would be the American legion and the veterans of foreign wars, but there are a lot more out there. If they don't have pro bono resources to help you they'll most likely be able to point you towards lawyers or legal services that would be able to help you most likely free of charge. I hope this helps.
The sworn statement is actually the mortgage re-financing where he notarized that he is the same person at my physical address listed and notarized with notary present.
Because the US is fucked up like that. It's literally called the American Rule where by default attorney fees can't be recovered, only in specific circumstances.
Thanks! My original closing lawyer was flabbergasted by the incompetency and gave me road map out as she explained the same thing having a wild deed and she spoke with the title company and they resolved the deed issue, but I am not sure how many records are crossed and it's stressing me out.
Nobody stole your house. Any deed issued for property that someone does not own is invalid. Some random title company cannot just give away your property and, assuming your deed when you bought the house was recorded, you won't lose it.
