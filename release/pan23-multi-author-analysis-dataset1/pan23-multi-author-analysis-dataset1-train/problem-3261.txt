I picked up that example of 300 partes because I happened to have this text from a funerary stone in mind. The imperial era owner of a slave interestingly brags more about his young slave Atticus than himself - probably because owning such an educated (and therefore, expensive) slave was a big status symbol. He has added that Atticus knew, so probably had memorised by heart, multiplication tables of 1/300, i.e. he could recite on the spot the interest rates of the most common monetary sums.
It's always interesting to me how a system can be developed very specifically to meet some required need, say binary in computing, or SI units, and be adopted generally, but an older system in a similar field may just be grandfathered in because it's traditional, instead of developing something that is more tailored to general needs.
Sure, my pleasure . Could you clarify what you mean by "numerology"? Romans, or at least some Romans, definitely had some mystical/esoteric associations with both numbers 10 and 12, the Pythagorean circles and their ideas of 12 as the "perfect number" etc. springing to mind as an example. I also tried to give some examples how this is reflected in Roman culture and tradition. For example, rather suspiciously, in Roman historical tradition the accounts of how their calendar and their first law code were created share the same theme of perfecting 10 to 12. King Numa first instituted a calendar with 10 months, realised this wasn't the ideal calendar, and then added two more months to make a perfect calendar of 12 months; and, when the first Roman law code was being created in the dawn of the Republic, it first included only 10 tables - but after some drama the code was perfected by the addition of two more, to make it the fabulous 12, and thus we know the text as the "Twelve Tables.".
