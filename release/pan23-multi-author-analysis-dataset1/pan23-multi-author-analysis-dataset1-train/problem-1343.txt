Without any knowledge of the specific HOA bylaws, it's basically impossible to know "what's best" in this situation other than a general knowledge that everyone is likely better off if the ex is convinced - regardless of how or by whom - to stop hanging around OP's house in an annoying or harassing way. For all we know, the HOA has insane bylaws about taking care of possible public nuisances and is full of [expletives] who would actually fine her if she didn't take reasonable steps to alleviate the nuisance/disturbance that is [apparently] taking place on her property...such as by filing a restraining order or calling the cops. At the end of the day, there are several steps several entities can take to address the problem. But OP can only control OP's actions and has no control over what her neighbors do/don't do to deal with the ex. I genuinely can't think of a scenario where it's in her best interest to just hope someone else makes him go away when she has some pretty easy-to-execute and reasonable options, and when in a worst case scenario her HOA bylaws might [reasonably or not] hold her responsible for problems stemming from her property.
1 Get cameras. \- You want to have proof of when, where, and how long he is just sitting around. It's important to get these up and running before there is any escalation and before he can do something more than sitting on your curb. You need proof of his behavior. From what you have described, it sounds like his behavior meets the definition of stalking.
