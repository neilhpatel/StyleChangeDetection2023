At this rate one of them will legitimately have an accident and fall out a window, and when that happens absolute chaos will erupt while they try to figure out who the hell sanctioned it, who they’re going to kill off next, and how they can keep themselves safe. It’ll be like The Big Lebowski. Wild.
What, you mean the best plan a national intelligence agency could come up with is to dress one of your guys up in the dead man’s clothes, wander aimlessly around Istanbul to be photographed by security cameras, then dispose of the clothes and pretend the man they belonged to fell off the face of the earth while his fiance forever waits for him in their parked car in front of the consulate like the guy in the taxi in “Airplane!”?
Why? I get why they kill dissidents, journalists, ect. Sends a "strong" message of "Don't you dare question the Government." But I can't understand killing people who seem to be loyal unless I'm just missing something. Sure, the war is going terribly and Putin is likely angry and wants to lash out, but what advantage is there to killing the person?
