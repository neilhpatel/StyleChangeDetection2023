I don’t watch any sports myself so maybe it’s harder than it seems but why is anyone even going to this if it’s so terrible? Just like literally don’t watch or support it and when it hits their wallets they’ll think three times before pulling this crap again. All these articles like “Qatar is terrible is because they made X do Y” well you’re the one who decided to go even though you knew it was a shitshow, women getting forced vaginal exams and people looked at that and thought “Man that’s terrible! Better confirm and make sure I got my ticket now that I’m thinking about it”. Makes no sense.
So we willingly participate in an event that got more than 6000 killed and countless more into forced labor and subhuman conditions, in a country we know doesn't value all people equally and actively discriminate, kill and enslave others.
Lol we wish. FIFA is getting away with it all things considered, and KSA will 100% bid to host. And they have plenty of bribing money too. FIFA be like: who else has deep pockets? China, do you wanna bid?
