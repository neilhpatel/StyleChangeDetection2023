Having said all this, the Aztecs kind of did have a navy, but it was a green water navy, rather than a blue water navy. It mainly consisted of canoes, which were used to ferry troops for co-ordinated amphibious attacks around the lakes in the Valley of Mexico. Now, a canoe may not seem like the most impressive of ships, but they were well suited to the conditions. The water was too shallow for larger ships, and canoes were extremely easy to handle while also carrying heavy loads of both supplies and men. The Aztecs went a step further, even armouring their canoes so they could act as a defensive platform for archers. They used this to great effect during the Siege of Tenochtitlan, as Diaz reports, 'Our crossbowmen and musketeers fired continuously at them and their canoes, but hardly did them any damage, for they were well protected by wooden bulwarks.'.
As far as I understand from the development of navies elsewhere in the world, they begin when nations have significant trading fleets that then encounter enemies that they need to fight on the water (usually over ocean resources and right of way to navigate one's ships through contested waters), whether those enemies are pirates or foreign nations. If all of your trade is over land, and all of your enemies are over land, the risk and the daunting level of material and engineering resources needed to develop a navy make it a pursuit not worth taking.
