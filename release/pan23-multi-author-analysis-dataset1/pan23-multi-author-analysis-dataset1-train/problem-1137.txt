They were kept alive by forcing payment in rubles. The sanctions were for IMPORTS but Russia could still export. They only sold on the condition they were paid in rubles. Their recession was inevitable but they bought themselves a few extra months.
Culture/History is treated/felt differently over there. Many Russians were born (generations) in Ukraine when it was the USSR and would never consider themselves Ukrainian. Why does Putin keep mentioning “nazis” - because there are neo-nazis in many parts of Ukraine (not saying the whole country, but some - same can be said about the many countries). But during WWII many Ukrainians “helped” the nazis (not always at gun point). So if you’re over the age of 60 in Russia, chances are you had a dad/uncle/grandpa that was killed fighting nazis - so you would want neo-nazis growing anywhere.
"Finally"? A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters in which the GDP shrinks. When you consider that wars don't start exactly at the start of a new quarter, this is basically the fastest possible speedrun to recession.
