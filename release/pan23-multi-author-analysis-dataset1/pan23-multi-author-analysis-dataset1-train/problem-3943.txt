I’m not sure if it counts as short or simple, but I recently noticed how much we mechanize our bodies in metaphors / instructions for healthy living etc. Food is fuel, the body is a machine, the heart is an engine and the brain is a supercomputer. What I’m interested in, were there widespread body metaphors before the invention of combustion engine and most mechanisms? What would an Ancient Greek or a medieval European learned man compare the body to? A fire, a house? A society made up of different elements working toward a common goal? An animal? Something spiritual? I’m not sure what else they could think of.
It began with an appeal by Lincoln for 75,000 militiamen to serve three months of service - this number and lenh of service was the maximum allowed to the federal government at the time according to a 1795 law, and this was something similar to federalizing the National Guard today (although the National Guard system as we know it didn't take shape until 1903).
Thank you! This is a great answer. I was surprised to find that George VI had so many siblings, basically, and that one of them who might plausibly have taken the throne under the circumstances was still alive. I hope he ended up not having too onerous a time of it all.
