That’s the thing, Ukraine needs to join NATO but not everyone will agree, they’ll be one of the most powerful with all the weapons and their fighting experience, we will just need a marshal plan for them after we spend what had once been ruzzian money but now will hopefully be used for reconstruction, it’ll probably cost a trillion dollars.
One day I went into Taco Bell. When I got into the line, the man in front of me was trying to convince the cashier to put the burrito on the counter before he paid. They kept going back and forth, not violently mind you, but definitely moronically. Of course the man never paid and eventually walked out... This exchange between the man and the taco bell employee made more sense than this. And Russia is just a homeless man begging for the burrito to be put on the counter.
Hmmmmm. See there's something MUUUCH easier ruZZia.... if you REALLY want this war to end, pull ALL your troops out of Ukraine, including Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, as well as all sham referendum annexed lands, and of course Crimea. Just go home, that's ALL you need to do.
