Could one part that led to the “discovery” of shellshock/battle fatigue/PTSD/etc be the modernization of warfare? The advent of 24/7 shelling, flares and illumination rounds, and the machinations of war that led to nonstop (or near nonstop) and more impersonal fighting?
Come 1914, the ability to shoot hundreds of meters away, lob massive artillery shells in indirect fire attacks from beyond line of sight, and machine guns that would mow down indiscriminate numbers of people arose. All this, plus chemical warfare, led to soldiers never knowing “when their time” would come, from gas, a shell the size of a small car, or a desperate run across a destroyed landscape. Even after all that, it was brutal hand to hand combat, only for the “lucky” to survive to deal with all of the above the next day. And the next. Even with the rotations to and from the front, it still was something largely unseen before. And even though chemical weapons would mostly disappear in large scale conflict, the reality that war forever changed was upon the world. Warfare was now a 24/7 operation.
Modern diagnosis have the benefit of a much better understanding of the human brain, modern medical imaging, and an overall higher level of scientific knowledge. Diagnostic criteria for conditions (such as shellshock) that are not well understood, tend to be more or less a vague specification of a group of symptoms that seem to be related.
