What might be the first African-American science-fiction story was Martin R. Delany's Blake; or, The Huts of America which was serialized in the Anglo-African Magazine (Jan-July 1859), although this was before science fiction was quite recognized as such, the eponymous Blake as an intelligent free black man who uses his technical knowledge and inventions to free himself and his family from slavery is a precursor to many similar figures. Lisa Yaszek in Black and Brown Planets compares this to Sutton E. Griggs' Imperium in Imperio (1899), Pauline Hopkins's Of One Blood; or, The Hidden Self (1903), Edward A. Johnson's Light ahead for the Negro (1904), Roger Sheman Tracy's The White Man's Burden: A Satirical Forecast (1915), and Geoge S. Schuyler's Black No More (1931) and Black Empire (1936-38).
Excellent discussion. But one quibble: didn't Bradbury have a story in The Illustrated Man (1951) about black people leaving Earth and colonizing Mars themselves?
“protagonist. The same would be largely true for comic books, which were descendants of the Pulps...with one notable exception: the infamous comic book story "Judgment Day" (Weird Fantasy 18, April 1953) where the astronaut removes his helmet at the end to reveal himself as black was subject to censorship - which the publisher famously denied, printing the story as-is.”.
Things would change. Racial politics became more prominent in the 1960s and 70s in the United States, and this would see some reflection in science fiction. More importantly, you had more young African-Americans reading science fiction and fantasy that would grow up to add their own voices: folks like Samuel R. Delaney, Octavia Butler, and Charles Saunders. Outside of science fiction and fantasy, black writers like Chester Himes were heavily influenced by Black Mask and other crime pulps.
