It did matter... We needed Congress to pass the Authorization to use Military Force in Iraq to go after Saddam and Iraq. The US military intervention in Libya was authorized by a UN Security Council resolution and a Senate ratification of the intervention, and compliance with the War Powers Act.
Well stated. I wonder if they were just the contractor though? FBI knew from at least one flight school that something was up and they ... chose? to ignore it?
Because if MBS is denied immunity, the family of Khashoggi will get a money judgment against him and then be able to use the US Marshals or local law enforcement to seize assets owned by MBS, force him to attend depositions, and subject him to contempt and jail if he refuses to participate in the US Courts. If this is allowed to happen, this single private US citizen/resident US is restricting the US Government to engage in diplomacy with Saudi Arabia.
Okay, got it. The President, and any other head of government, is immune from prosecution of any crime.
