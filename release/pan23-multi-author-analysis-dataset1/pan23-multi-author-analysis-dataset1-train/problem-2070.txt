Literary sources like Ã†lfric's Colloquy also make reference to specific individuals within a community taking responsibility for the entire community's livestock, e.g. an oxherd and ploughman who between them rear the entire village's oxen and plough everybody's fields. In these contexts, it's likely that there is unlikely to have been that much disparity between the quality of different individuals' flour. Where complications may have arisen is in communities where multiple grass crops - wheat, barley, rye etc. - were also grown. However, from sites like Stafford, we know that there were separate sites and ovens for baking wheat flour bread and barley flour bannocks (essentially a kind of porridge loaf; heavy, dense and less refined, but very calorific).
Typically, villagers would pay a miller to grind their flour, which they would either then use to make a dough at home and take to the communal oven, or pay a baker to make into dough and then cook for them. The baker, if there was one, was the individual responsible primarily for the operation of the oven itself, rather than necessarily how we might understand a modern baker, who sources flour, prepares bread and then hopes to sell it all. Bakers would have mass-baked bread and then distributed it, but this would have been to pre-existing customers who had previously supplied the flour.
