1/2 It is not easy to find a career in history, but neither is it impossible. It depends on what you want to do. For reference, I have a BA in Canadian history and make a living adapting scholarship (usually historical, though not always) into graphic novels. I don't know anyone else who makes a living this way.
No actually. There are two factors that go into that. I am a teacher in Texas. My certification is Composite Social Studies which means I am qualified to teach all the histories, govt and Econ, geography, psych, sociology, and anthropology. If you go the HS teacher route and your state has a composite cert I highly recommend it. So the first factor is that I am considered “highly qualified” because of my certification even though it is NOT something I took significant course work in during college. The second factor is that as a HS teacher there is not as much specialization. Some teachers teach the same thing FOREVER but a lot of the time faculty get reassigned to a new subject based on an opening that needs filling. If you teach US History, the Govt. teacher just left, and the person the principal is interviewing is terrible/uncomfortable about teaching govt you might get moved. This only really happens over the summer but anything is possible depending on where you are.
