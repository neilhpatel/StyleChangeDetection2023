A great deal of pre 20th century warfare was organized around maintaining group order. Battles are noisy, chaotic, dangerous, and frightening. Keeping formations intact, and keeping men close enough together - sometimes even close enough to touch the man beside him - was important in giving the appearance of order. A volley, fired all together, or an advance that doesn't stop because men are advancing at the same pace in the same direction, has far more chance of shifting the enemy away than a bunch of men acting individually.
Yep. Especially the various forms of flags/standards/colours. More can be said on the matter if anyone would like to contribute their knowledge; for the meantime, with contributions from u/nilhaus and u/MandoMonroe cover exactly the same territory you've just asked about, OP. While nilhaus covers the American Civil War, I can say that their post is also applicable to the earlier conflicts, including sending the bandsmen to the rear and having them recover casualties.
Discipline. I'll break it down further below, but the individual ability of a single drummer boy or ensign with the standard to fight was unimportant. Their role was to allow the rest of the unit to stay organized and fight as a cohesive whole.
