Or to give perhaps a more broad example, I have personally found the English Civil War fascinating in part because it was a conflict that was on the one hand about fundamental questions of social organization and the structure of politics, and at the same time it was about worship and the structure of the Church (one might say it is both fully political and fully religious). At times there is a stereotype that it was between the dour, religiously fanatical Puritans and the more freewheeling, decadent royalists, but this of course misses the entirety of it. Charles I was devoutly Christian, everything he believed about the monarchy tied back to his fundamental beliefs in God's will. But, of course, John Pym was also devoutly Christian, and believed in a very profound way that the path he took was the one marked by God. Every single person who killed and died at Nasby did so under the banner of God's will.
I don't want to suggest that this would be a good, let alone uncontroversial, argument – I'm not really in a position to adequately consider how this may have diverged from pagan theology, nor does it seem to straightforwardly avoid the issue of not reflecting the realities of Christian practice both historically and in the present day – but it doesn't strike me at face as a straightforwardly laughable argument.
Just jaw dropping. "Offensive" is a word that perhaps has lost some power, but I do not know another word for the conscriptions of the victims of the Holocaust into a paean for the necessity of the New Testament.
