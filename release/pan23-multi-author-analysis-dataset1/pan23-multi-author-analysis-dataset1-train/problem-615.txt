The 1970's seems a little bit early for the last person to have died, but that's often the period where it was clear in Western Europe that the old culture was gone, a process which arguably started with the end of the Second World War, or the that of the First World War, or the introduction of railroads and mass schooling and mass conscription in the 19th century, or even the agricultural revolution of the 18th century.
Thank you for the recommendation! I think you are completely right; more schools may for instance teach Breton like they currently do Latin, but it is hard to imagine the Republic letting schools chose their language of instruction. We are a bit prickly when it comes to those things, certainly by American standards.
But this relatively plentiful, relatively cheap food, plus advances in hygiene and medicine, mean that even as agricultural labor as a percentage of total labor is declining in the 19th century (in much of Western Europe I imagine it's very roughly 50% in the 1880-1900 period), higher as you go further away from the heartlands of the Industrial Revolution, the rural population in numerical terms doesn't decline until laterâ€”one source I found says late 19th century for Western Europe, the 1920's for Central Europe and Scandinavia, 1930's for Eastern Europe. And this decline doesn't actually hurt agricultural output from these regions because of all the continuing productivity gains we see, such as tractorization.
