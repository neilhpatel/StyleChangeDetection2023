Can you explain? By headers I assume they mean the smtp headers. These contain the hash values, time stamps, sending, receiving and intermediary server domains (if any) through which the email was routed. Basically they contain all the forensic information necessary to establish the veracity of the email.
Forensics would never establish authenticity without examination of an external entity and both the printed and electronic versions do that equally.
I work in HR. Unfortunately yes companies can take away bonus plans. Is it written in your contract/offer letter that your bonus is guaranteed? You mentioned that they already stated bonuses are not guaranteed. So from what Iâ€™m seeing, yes they can decide to not pay your bonus. Does your employer have a policy regarding their bonus plan?
Several things can contribute to not paying bonuses, and company performance is one of them. Did your employer recently do budget cuts? Unfortunately many companies have had to do this during the pandemic, which often involves cutting (or temporarily halting) bonus plans.
