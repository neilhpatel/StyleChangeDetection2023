Washinon has a pretty high sales tax, around 10% in the Seattle Metro area, mostly because income tax is disallowed by our state constitution, and any attempts at anything that looks like an income tax gets killed in our courts. We all know here our tax structure is the most regressive (tax burden split: lowest 20%: 17.8%, middle 60%: 10.4%, top 1%: 3%), but there's little we can do to change it here. Compare to nearby Oregon which has 0% sales tax and an income tax rate of between 4.75% and 9.9% and is in the top 10 for least regressive (lowest 20%: 10.1%, middle 60%: 8.8%, top 1%: 8.1%).
Waitaminnit. I thought I remember 20-30 years ago when people loved the idea of doing away with income tax and switching to a flat sales tax. I'm not denying that it looks really bad today, but what changed?

Exactly! If I travel to the states, my Australian dollars are still getting taxed at my marginal rates, and add that to a suboptimal exchange rates there is absolutely fucking no good reason to go.
