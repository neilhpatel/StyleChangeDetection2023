That's not to say that appealing probation is never successful, but it is _extremely_ nitty and fact-specific. It's going to require a solid understanding of relevant case law, including understanding how and when it applies or does not apply, as well as a thorough review of the facts of your son's case.

If he absolutely insists on this stupidity, well, it's his appeal to waste. He'll have to do his research without access to the internet, because he isn't going to get that term suspended pending appeal. That means going to physical law libraries (and sometimes paying user fees, if he's not a member of the associated law school) and university libraries to read physical documents and prepare his arguments.
In principle, he can research past cases via law libraries or by going to the courthouse and pulling the files, and read legal scholarship by going to a university's library and reading relevant scholarly journals for free there, but it won't help him much. The kind of work needed to assemble an effective appeal is as much understanding as it is knowing.
