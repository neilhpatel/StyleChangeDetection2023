>"Save the children from the Russians’ villainy; if you are able to, leave the region. Let’s home after the liberation!" the National Resistance Center highlighted.
Yes. Do you understand that Russia never hand any animosity towards Ukraine? At least the years I am alive. You can bring up shit from 80 years ago, but I would argue that Russians and Ukrainians living in USSR lives in same cities, listened to the same music, read the same books, went to vacations in the same cities, watched the same movies, laughed at the same political jokes, had children that went to same school. Never in my life I heard anything derogatory or hateful towards Ukraine or Ukrainians. I’ve been to Ukraine many times. And never felt unwelcome. I was young, but nonetheless.
The obliteration of entire cities, rape as a war weapon, tacit threats of beginning world war three and extortion of entire continents through energy policy all taken together as a combined machinery as open war that risks global starvation and calamity are significant factors in recognizing this as a planetary moment of disaster. This is on a completely different scale of hideous.
