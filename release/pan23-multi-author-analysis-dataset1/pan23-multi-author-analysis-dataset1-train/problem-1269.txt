The offside calls were made using VAR and each one of them was actually offside as displayed during the game. Anyone telling you otherwise doesn’t know the game or hasn’t watched it. Regarding the second point, this is the only post in which I’ve seen people saying Saudi players had a questionable amount of energy and suggesting that they were on illegal substance but I’m not surprised because this is Reddit and this sub is skewed towards Americans who are generally not very familiar with this sport. However, the stats show that Argentina collectively ran a greater distance than Saudi did throughout the game. The 2 Saudi goals were the only good chances they had in the game and they took it. They parked the bus after just like any underdog team would do. It was a well deserved victory.
In case you don't know what off-side means in soccer: it's when a player makes a forward pass while there are less than 2 players (including keeper) of the opposing team between their goal time and the player being passed to or another player that influences the game through positioning.
2. Argentina's defense wasn't awful, but it looked sloppy compared to what I was hoping for. That first goal from the Saudis shouldn't have happened. The 2nd one was pretty brilliant though.
