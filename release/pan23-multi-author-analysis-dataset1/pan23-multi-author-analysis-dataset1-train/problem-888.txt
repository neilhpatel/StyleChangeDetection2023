Cats hate the water because their fur does not insulate well when it’s wet. The Turkish Van, however, is one cat that likes swimming. Bred in central Asia, its coat has a unique texture that makes it water resistant.
You might have a case that there is a legal divorce decree that states each parent is responsible for 50% of your college debt, but the retainer for a lawyer in some areas can be 7-10k, I don’t know if a lawyer would touch this case on contingency, and then actually enforcing the order for the parents to pay the debt could all be problematic. Maybe start with a family law attorney, not your parent’s former attorney. They can normally look up the case and the judgment. The fact that you are an adult, that you signed paperwork for the loans might put you in a tough spot. I am so sorry about your situation. Good luck.
I know the chances are slim because I did sign the loan, but she’s destroying my ability to be financially independent with this and I need some sort of legal threat to get her to actually take this seriously.
How? Are you talking about the divorce decree? What is the exact statement? Is the specific loan and amounts mentioned?
If the loan is only in your name, you are solely responsible for it. Divorce decree will only hold them accountable for loans they are responsible for.
