It could potentially be a different sort of mess even if forgiveness does happen. There are a lot of people who will still have a balance even after $10k or $20k gets forgiven and itâ€™s gonna be difficult for some of those people to shift money back to payments when it has been extremely helpful in paying for increasingly expensive living expenses like groceries, gas, rent or mortgages, etc.
This is a win-win for him. If the courts allow the forgiveness, younger voters are happy and they are a fast growing and more politically involved group than they've ever been. If the courts block it, Biden can freeze the payments until the election and hold it over the GOP candidate to drive dem turn out. Brilliant.
Now we get to watch as Republicans slowly finger their buttholes and then lose even worse in the election because they continue to alienate the educated members of society and the moderates who aren't psychopath religious nuts.
True. They also need to do something about the crazy interest rates and the tax bomb waiting for borrowers enrolled in the income-based repayment plans.
