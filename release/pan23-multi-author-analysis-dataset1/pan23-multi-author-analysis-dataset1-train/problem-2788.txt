No, what happens with term limits is the pols spend all their time finding their next gig and voting strictly for personal gain. They no longer have any need to cater to the voters. Term limits neatly bankrupted CA.
I think there is a good argument to be made for an age limit (maybe federal retirement age + 10 or something) but I think term limits is using a machete instead if a scalpel; for every jackass you get rid of, theres's also at least one great legislator (if not more) who are also forced out.
This is not true. Voters could have chosen Kevin de Le√≥n, the other Democrat who made it to the general election. He was endorsed by the California Democratic Party and still lost.

No insitutional knowledge retained by senior legislators. If congress members only get two terms, eg, they don't have the time to truly learn how to legislate. The lobbyists who have been around for decades will be the support they will have to lean on to get things done.
