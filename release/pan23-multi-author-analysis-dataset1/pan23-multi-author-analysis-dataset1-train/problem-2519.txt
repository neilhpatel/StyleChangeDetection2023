This is a great resource. I think the thing to point out is that it is on the employer to exhaust all efforts the find a replacement.
The facility is already chronically understaffed. One person on staff is grossly unsafe. What if he has to go to the hospital with a client. They can't go alone. And they can't be left alone. There has to be at least 2 people.
My Adult Family Home did a "sleep shift" where I worked 7am - 11pm Saturday, slept in an employee room for 8 hours (paid minimum wage as opposed to regular rate), woke up and did another full 16 hours Sunday.
Ok. I work in healthcare in NJ. The state has mandated that Nursing staff is not to work more than 18 hrs straight because after that time they are considered unsafe to practice. Your judgement and reaction rime is altered from sleep deprivation. It is state law. Was enacted years ago to protect nurses from these practices. You are considered nursing, it is slightly different in the group home setting, but you still need to be relieved.
