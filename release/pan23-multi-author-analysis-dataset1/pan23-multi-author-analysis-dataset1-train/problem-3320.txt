No, they're not. Just because Boebert is a moron doesn't have anything to do with her education level. Ben Carson is a world class surgeon but he's also kind of a dullard, for example. Sure, wanting someone educated is a good thing, but I'll take someone of strong integrity and poor education over someone with a doctorate and a desire to see fascism rise in this country. There's a balance to be struck to be able to govern this country, which is why the standards are so low now. It's to let the people who voted decide if the candidate meets their standards.

While she was letting her speak, it was hilarious to watch Stephanie's body language, holding her breath, arms crossed, raised eyebrows, squinting her eyes, basically making all the facial expressions of someone using all her strenh to suffer through the torrent of inanity that was coming from Boebert's mouth .
That's just it, though. What's the metric for education or integrity in the first place? Is Boebert disqualified for her GED or her nuttier than a candy bar mindset? How do you measure it? Should a highly intelligent person that dropped out of high school but is a natural leader or a self educated intelligent able enough?
