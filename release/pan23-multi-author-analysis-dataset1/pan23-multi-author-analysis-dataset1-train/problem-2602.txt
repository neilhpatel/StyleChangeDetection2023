We haven’t had a new massive missile strike in quite some time, our forces were predicting that the next one could happen at the end of this week, and it still might, but usually they don’t fire missiles during the weekends. The last big missile strike did happen on weekend, but it was a special occasion, because they would never miss an opportunity to bomb us on New Year’s. So I’m not sure if there will be a missile strike today or tomorrow, though there’s a good chance it will happen at the start of the next week.
