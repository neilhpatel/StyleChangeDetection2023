This! I'm probably more progressive than Biden; but I'm extremely happy with his term so far. That said, I would greatly prefer someone with similar politics to him but younger. Unfortunately I don't know that Harris is a good enough politician for the campaign. I really liked her early in the primaries but she wasn't good enough on the stump. She would probably be a great POTUS; but might not be able to win unless Trump runs as a 3rd party and splits the Republicans.

Absolutely agreed. But Boomers have been dominating elections since Reagan, which gives them a lot of responsibility for where things stand. You're right that the choices about how we're governed are made by people who bother to show up and vote. The other side of that coin is old people accepting responsibility for the fucked up situations created by voting for shitty people for decades. Let's hear it, old folks, step up and take the blame you deserve.
