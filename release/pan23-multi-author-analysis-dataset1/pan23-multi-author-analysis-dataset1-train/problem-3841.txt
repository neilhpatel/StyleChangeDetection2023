Its easy to believe because its easier to think you are doing your bit by giving up meat. But your not. Only thing that will save us is giving up fossil fuels. Anything that distracts from that central truth is destructive. Thats why big Carbon promote the whole meat misinformation line. It works in their favour.
People don't realize how impactful the animal agriculture industry is because ads tell us all about "happy cows" and "incredible, edible eggs," but if you read up on it, you'll see factory farming is detrimental to the planet.
No they do not. I think they mostly maintain the roads and elect delegates to the national senate. Perhaps they make some rules but these aren't laws.
If its targetting meat and fish that's counterproductive since it supports a diversonary narrative promoted by fossil fuel company PR agencies to divert attention from their culpability.
Still just as many.. They just replace it with a different ugly shitty consumable add, for which we actually need to get pay for, to have it in your face all the fucking time.
