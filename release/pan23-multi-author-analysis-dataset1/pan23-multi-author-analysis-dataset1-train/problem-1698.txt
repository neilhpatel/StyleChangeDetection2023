The Cherokee nation sits within the state of Oklahoma and, while sovereign in certain affairs, is covered by Oklahoma's house districts. Cherokee citizens are also US citizens with all the rights of US citizenship. This means that Cherokee citizens living in the Cherokee nation have the right to vote for both their congressional house representative and to vote in Oklahoma senate elections. They also may vote for Oklahoma's governor, an Oklahoma state house representative, and an Oklahoma state senator. There are no , outside of a state. This means all American Indians are citizens of US, whichever state they reside in, and their respective tribes. So they do have representation within state and federal government at present. Though there is an argument to be made that the tribal governments themselves need representation.
Absolutely! I’m a history teacher, so I definitely have an appreciation for it. My Mom has done some of her history. Very little is truly known about my Dad’s side because his father was adopted. Record keeping in the early 1900s was naught.
While seating the delegate selected by the Cherokee Nation would grant increased representation, it would not give American Indians representation as a whole because the US government recognizes 574 tribes. The State of Alaska has the most recognized tribes with 231.
