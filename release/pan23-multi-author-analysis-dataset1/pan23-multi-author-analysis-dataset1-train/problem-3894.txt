The client knows just as well as you do that an LLC protects you from personal liability. If you were to sign only in your LLC capacity, and then you were to break the agreement and cause damages (for example, by failing to do work for which you were pre-paid, by disclosing confidential information, by delivering work that steals another party's intellectual property, etc.), they would only be able to sue the LLC. But the LLC is not going to have any money of its own. So they'd be SOL. That's why they'll want you to "co-sign" on whatever promises your LLC makes, so that they would be able to go after your personal assets.
If your client is smart, they're going to require that you sign the consulting agreement in both of your capacities, as an LLC manager and as an individual. Otherwise, they would have virtually no recourse against you if you breach the contract.
Marketing! So itâ€™s completely remote but I would be managing a large budget and authorized to make purchases on behalf of the company.
