So what was the Mongol's secrete? Firstly Tem√ºjin instilled into his warriors a greater degree of military structure and discipline into Mongols under his command. He separated his troops into distinct units with levels of command, units split into smaller units each with a dedicated commander who would be either voted on by their subordinates or at the top levels appointed by Chinggis himself. This made it much easier to both be able to coordinate a plan prior to an engagement then during the fight send orders down the chain of command as the situation unfolded as well as for smaller unit commanders to react to changes in the battlefield at their own level. This made it much easier to reliably carry out those kinds of feigned withdraw tactics that you describe which without these kinds of tools of command and control are pretty difficult to coordinate on the scale of a major battles.
