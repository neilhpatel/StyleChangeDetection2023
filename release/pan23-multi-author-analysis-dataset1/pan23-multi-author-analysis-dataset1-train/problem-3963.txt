Some quick geneaology. The first independent ruler of Tenochtitlan, and thus the first "Aztec Emperor" was Itzcoatl, who led a successful revolution against the Tepanecs. It was his nephew, Motecuhzoma Ilhuicamina, who really established the Aztecs as a burgeoning superpower in Mesoamerica. Motecuhzoma ended up with no son of his own to succeed him, but his daughter had married a son of Itzcoatl, and they had three sons: Axayacatl, Tizoc, and Ahuitzotl.
The eldest brother, Axayacatl, succeeded to the throne after the death of his grandfather, Motecuhzoma Ilhuicama. He was a perfectly serviceable ruler who basically shored up and modestly expanded the conquests of his predecessor. He stabilized the Aztec state following an explosion in growth. His successor, Tizoc, was a fucking disaster. He led an initial pyrrhic campaign, put down a couple rebellions, and then was either assassinated 5 years into his reign or "died under suspicious circumstances.".
Diego Dur√°n The History of the Indies of New Spain(1581) says only the nobility engaged in cannibalism of a ritualistic nature, he also gives the improbably high figure of 80,400 sacrifices that the main poster mentions.
