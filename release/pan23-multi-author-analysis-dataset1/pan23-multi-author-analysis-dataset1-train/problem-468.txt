I mean, anything's possible, especially with this Supreme Court, but unlike Trump, Hunter Biden isn't supposed to have his taxes audited every year, because Hunter isn't even in office.
I agree with all of this, and what will probably happen is Hunter Biden will challenge turning over his tax returns to Congress for lack of legislative purpose, he'll win, Republicans won't get his returns, and so they won't be able to actually release his returns.
Also, what's someone (Trump, DeSantis, some other future GOP President) going to do, release Biden's tax returns that he already voluntarily released? Or Obama's, that he already voluntarily released? Or Clinton's, that he already voluntarily released? Fucking lol.
There is zero interest, legislative or voter, in knowing the financials of someone who is not a government employee, whom has zero influence upon Congress, and is only mentioned by right-wing media because they want to talk about anything except trump, the extended trump family, or 1/6/21.
