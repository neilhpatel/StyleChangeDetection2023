Yes because gangsters are the kind of people who are allways willing to die for the sake of ideals. By global that is Russia against how many nuclear countries? I am not so sure they have friends willing to join in. I thought supplying Ukraine was the trigger. Or any attack on their territory. ?
Also note: the huge Ukrainian orgy organized to happen in case Russia started using tactical battlefield nukes - that attitude saying "we're obviously not going to give up and if you choose to escalate, we might as well go down fskng" is one of the coolest vibes I've seen in a minute.
Yawn. No one cares Russia. You threaten nuclear war on a daily basis when any country in the West sends military aid to Ukraine or when Ukraine refuses to surrender to your insane demands.
Good. Just drop them already so we can glass you. I’m not even fighting and I’m getting absolutely exhausted hearing about every Russian threat. They’re going to lose but refuse to accept it. I’d almost rather they drop a nuke so we can end the war instead of waiting for years of them throwing bodies at the Ukrainians to lose.
