Most likely you'd have bipartisan committee co-chairs and bipartisan staff. The legislative calendar would also likely be some bipartisan formulation. The speakership would just be a figurehead except on rules issues, where I'm not really worried about Cheney's ideology.
If you're concerned about Cheney's ideology, you don't understand what the speaker does generally or what she'd need to do in this coalition situation. The only thing she'd be needed for is settling rules disputes, which I'm not worried about and you shouldn't be either.
Neo-liberal-- a political approach that favors free-market capitalism, deregulation, and reduction in government spending.
Yeah. Basically democratic bills wouldn't go forward, but neither would there be endless investigations into Hunter Biden and playing chicken with the debt ceiling. Seems reasonable to me.
Neo- conservative-- relating to or denoting a return to a modified form of a traditional viewpoint, in particular a political ideology characterized by an emphasis on free-market capitalism and an interventionist foreign policy.
