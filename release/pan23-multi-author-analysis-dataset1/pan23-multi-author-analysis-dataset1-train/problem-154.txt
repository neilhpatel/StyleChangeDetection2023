Apparently from what the article says. I know they have been using this technique where they would put the fuel used in nuclear missiles or smth like that, which does not cause nuclear explosion but replicates the sound and the look kind of. Russians are very low on missiles allegedly so yeah, them using nuclear missiles without the actual nuclear component seems plausible.
1. Murdering civilians because your civilians got murdered isn't at all morally justifiable (should Ukraine target Russian hospitals?).
No it's not like they would have invited directors of the CIA or other defense branches but they would have invited wealthy American defense contractors and other individual rich Americans that are "interested" in nuclear weapons but unbeknownst to the Russians or even if they would care, those rich individuals and defense contractors would not be using their own money to bid on the weapons and would be using our tax dollars. Which is one of the things I actually would not mind my tax dollars being used for if it denuclears Russia.
Debatable. Just because missiles are more widely manufactured than nuclear warheads is as much a matter of global politics as anything else. The Iran nuclear deal limited their capacity for nuclear warheads, not missile development. And both missiles and nuclear weapons are the result of WW2 development.
