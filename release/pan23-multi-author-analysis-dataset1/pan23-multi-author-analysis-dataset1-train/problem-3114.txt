I have never run across any evidence whatsoever to suggest that the English Civil War was a factor leading to the American Civil War. Disagreement between North and South revolved around plenty of issues, but they were all related in one way or another to slavery. Cromwell was never mentioned in any ordnance of secession, but slavery was. And I think it's awfully odd that some grudge from the 17th century was big enough to lead to a civil war in 1861, but not bad enough to keep northern and southern colonies from uniting against the British in 1775. It just doesn't make sense to me.
These early works were followed/accompanied by straight up historical fiction reinforcing the same myths, that the South--and Virginia in particular--was populated by "country gentlemen" devoted to honor and chivalry. At the same time, the Yankee myth emerged, too -- the self-made man, often an immigrant, who strove for an egalitarian society absent a class system. But these Yankees also happened to be greedy, unscrupulous, and not devoted to chivalry or honor like their Southern counterparts. It should be pointed out, too, that during this stage, the myths were being promoted both North and South.
