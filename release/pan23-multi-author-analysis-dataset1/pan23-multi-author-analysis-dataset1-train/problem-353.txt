When you use an ATM, there are : the first is the retail fees, which have limits at both the state and federal level, and the second is the wholesale fees that are a negotiation between the ATM servicing company (the people that put your ATM into the various ATM networks) and the ATM networks and the banks.
Honestly no. I just tried to find information and actually it seems very possible and legal. Nba player deshawn Stevenson has one on his kitchen apparently. So yeah good luck man! ðŸ™Œ.
Forth, when you get into the ATM business, you rapidly learn about all the challenges of cash control, cash accounting (not cash basis accounting, but literally keeping up with the cash), AML laws, and regulatory paperwork. This is not something for an unsophisticated person to do. There's a reason that the companies that do this for a living are companies. New laws and regulations happen all the time, and then you find yourself needing to retrofit your ATM with $1,500 worth of new parts to bring it into compliance with the latest ADA guidelines, for example. Or you need to replace your mainboard and reprogram the machine with new keys because there was a flaw in the keystore that has to be fixed before you can bring your machine back online.
Is this against the law? I don't see why it would be. But on a practical basis? Unless you have a lot of accounts from a lot of different banks, the bank(s) are likely to notice that you are costing them a lot of money for essentially no return, and drop you.
(And yes, many banks keep track of how often you call customer service (or even visit a teller in-person), though that doesn't usually lead to accounts getting dropped... just if they were your actual everyday bank, you would not be getting any breaks on interest rates, penalty fee waivers, etc.).
