There are a great many things that when looked at through the lens of common sense don't seem as if they should be legal. The reality is often very different. Like you, I don't have first hand knowledge of what occured, but for conversation sake, let's imagine that a third party was contracted to obtain business for the end provider. That third party might get paid for each sign up and might do or say whatever is necessary to meet that goal. That third party once paid wouldn't give a wet slap about the consequences to either the vendor or customer. It is entirely possible that just such an occurrence took place. This makes it more understandable that hoodwinking could have taken place and relieves both the vendor and customer of any misrepresentation. It's unfortunate that such shenanigans take place but it's also quite obvious that they do and innocent parties are left to pick up the pieces. I understand your frustration in this matter, but in all likelihood there is simply nothing to be done except learn from the experience. I truly wish it were not so but it's the only conclusion I can arrive at.
"Understandable"? I don't see how outsourcing liars makes the problem any more "understandable". Their business model very clearly relies on lying to people to trick them into signing up for, and staying signed up for, as many services as possible. This is a known issue with television providers, and the providers know it themselves. I don't see how outsourcing liars changes anything.
