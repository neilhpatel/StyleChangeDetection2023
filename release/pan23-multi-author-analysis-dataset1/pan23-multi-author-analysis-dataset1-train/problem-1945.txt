Everyone thinks they're "young and in good shape" so they don't need to worry. I've had two friends who thought they were "young and in good shape" die of COVID so far. One was only in his mid-40s, the owner of a successful business that employed dozens of people, and had no cormorbidities. I guess he was just too old to continue living. And the number of friends whose lives and emotional health have been severely impacted due to caring for and protecting elderly relatives is boggling. COVID is still a thing.

I wish. It's truly crazy that there's no permanent law requiring sick time. As an optician, my PTO and sick time are the same thing so if I get sick once I don't get vacation time pretty much. It's insulting and I know I don't even have it as bad as other people.
