Its not a drug test, its my private medical history. I'm being shit on for having my mental health shed all over the company. It's all my private medical information. It's my medications. It's what I was hospitalized for. And I work there. I would like someone to speak to in private.
If the results were downloaded and stored on a company drive (for some totally legit record keeping reasons) and an employee accessed them through the company hard drive, that would not be a HIPAA violation because the violation didn't occur under a covered entity under HIPAA (the lab that did the screening).
Lets say my friends name is Brianne, and I am Brittany. I typed in B-R-I and came across is on public domain. Checked 4 other employees computers, checked mine. Its all there.
HIPAA doesn't just apply to illegally gotten data--but it does appear that HIPAA would not regulate the use of this information by an employer; only a medical provider.
Thank you. They are aware I know, and saw as IT was able to tell them where the file was originally deleted, lol. They were scrounging to cover their asses on Friday, but again, panic attacks which are now made public to the whole company has me shaking to go in to the place I've worked the last two years.
