Italy joined the war in 1940 soon after the German invasion of France. Soon after this there was fighting primarily between commonwealth and Italian forces along the borders of their territories, fighting along the border of British controlled Egypt and the Italian colony of Libya as well as fighting along the borders of Sudan and the Italian colonies of Eritrea, and Ethiopia while the Italians managed to invade the under garrisoned British colony of British Somaliland.
Thanks for the answer. But it still sounds to me like a hard fought war. Why is there so litle information about this compared to the rest of the war? No series, few books and no movies as far as I could find.
Back in North Africa the two sides were caught up in a lenhy siege at Tobruk, with it being successfully evacuated the garrison in November, elsewhere the Axis forces, increasingly lead by the Germans, put the Commonwealth back on the retreat over the course of 1941 continuing into 42 when Americans began to reinforce Commonwealth and Free French forces in British controlled Egypt with a major defeat occurring over the course of May and June thanks to the Germans breaking the American's code and partly thanks to a poorly lead counter attack.
With an Italian defeat in North Africa becoming increasingly probably as its 10th army surrendered in February the Germans began to reinforce them with the famous Rommel commanding the Afrika Korps with the ultimate objective of taking the Suez Canal.
