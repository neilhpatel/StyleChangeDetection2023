I try to inform these rural Texas who spout about “their tax money” that they’re not even coming close to paying their own way, and wouldn’t have electricity, phones, internet, paved roads, etc. if it weren’t for the blue cities in Texas and blue states in the US subsidizing the hell out of them. They either don’t believe indisputable reality even with sources proving I’m right, or they come back with “what would the cities do without food, huh?” Well, we have money and hence can buy food from elsewhere if we had to. And we’d have a lot more money if our taxes weren’t paying their bills plus our own.
Literally! Nothing else comes close. And yet we’re the “hellhole”. I’d like to know what hellhole Bailey was talking about because this place is pretty awesome and has been for the 30 years I’ve been on this earth.

Fascist fucks, so hypocritical and undeserving of any label related to traditional conservative ideology. No wonder true conservative intellectuals like George Will have abandoned the GOP.
