Absolutely not. Ukraine has never held irredentist ideals and never will. An invasion will destroy all western goodwill forever. Transnistria borders both Moldova and Ukraine equally and also roughly holds an equal amount of Moldovans, Russians and Ukrainians. Moldova has always unquestionably held rightful claim, even in Soviet times. The area really is just another remnant of very poor and spiteful Soviet policy making. It’s a very fascinating read on Wikipedia if you want a rabbit hole.
