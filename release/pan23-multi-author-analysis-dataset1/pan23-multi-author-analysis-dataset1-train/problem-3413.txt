Right. It’s still beyond me that you have to go to college for hotel management but not police work. 4 year degrees at least before they are given a gun.
Sounds like common sense doesn’t it, taxpayers shouldn’t have to fund classes on how not to kill taxpayers because we can’t trust them to begin with; new standards of training are desperately needed… but that’s where lawmakers have taken it by giving police immunity for so many years and allowing “self-policing” of internal affairs… we investigated ourselves and we found we’ve done nothing wrong.

I agree that they worked then. I agree in the power of it. But now due to the hyper militarization of the police and the conservative 2A movement in general, I think that that kind of effort would be effectively crushed. I mean Trump activated all kinds of psychos from the feds to go beat people in Portland -- most of those guys did crimes and the government still won't/can't reveal who they are.
