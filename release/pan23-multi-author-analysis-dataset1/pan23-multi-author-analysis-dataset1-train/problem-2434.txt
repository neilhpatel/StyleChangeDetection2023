In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly! It's much easier for our brains to accept early nighttime than late morning. All these people in northern states insisting that they want a half hour of light after they come home from work are underestimating how oppressive the dark mornings will be for them (I've seen people in the thread saying 9 am sunrise would be okay). People in northern states experiencing severe depression in the 70s when they tried permanent DST is WHY they repealed it so quickly. Every expert on sleep says the same thing: permanent standard time is much much better for our natural sleep patterns.

Exactly. People also think "more daylight = good" without stopping to consider where that more daylight is coming from. Sure, you might get sunset after you get home from work, but your commute and the first two hours of your work/school day will be in the dark.
