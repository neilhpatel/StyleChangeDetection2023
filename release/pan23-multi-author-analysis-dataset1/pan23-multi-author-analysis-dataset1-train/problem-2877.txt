Gonna throw my uneducated guess into the mix on this. It seems likely that NORAD has started to track objects they otherwise wouldn’t based on what happened last week. While it probably showed up on radar before, they obviously didn’t track the incursions during Trump’s presidency, as they just found out about those after the latest incident. So it seems reasonable that these are just actual weather balloons that are now being flagged as threats, and we’re shooting them down in an abundance of caution. Again, I don’t know shit about this so don’t take my word for it.
>	Since NORAD detected the object over Alaska on Friday evening, North American officials had closely monitored it as it crossed into Canadian airspace on Saturday, Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement. Following the call between President Biden and Trudeau, Biden authorized the F-22 to shoot down the object with a missile in Canadian territory, Ryder said.
Probably. It would just be nice to have seen Canada take it out, so it doesn't appear that's it's just the US going all out on the balloon popping game.
