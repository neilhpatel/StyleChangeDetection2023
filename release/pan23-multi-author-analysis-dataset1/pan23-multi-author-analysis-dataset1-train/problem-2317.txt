If you want unbiased, incontestable history, I'm afraid you won't like what you get. Imagine, for example, asking your father what his grandmother was like, since she died before you were born. You would be disappointed if your father said, "She was born in 1889 in a suburb of Boston where she went to school. In her twenties she took a vacation to California where she met her future husband. They were married in 1920, and she gave birth to three children. Her husband died in 1929, and she raised her children by herself during the Great Depression. She died in 1969." That "history" of this person is objective, unbiased history. And it gives you nothing of what you really want. I suspect when you asked your father about your great-grandmother, you wanted to know what she was "like" - not the biographical details, but rather you wanted an assessment about what it was like to know her and what affect she had on her family.
Beautiful answer - simple, comprehensible, and illuminating. I wish I had this talent. I am a scientist, and I often struggle with explaining why I am an opponent of STEM focused K-12 education in a society that increasingly relies on scientists and science literacy.
Well that's better, right? Except that you ask that to be confirmed by your great aunt, the daughter of your great-grandmother. You tell her what your father said, and she says, "Your father doesn't know what he's talking about. My mother was an alcoholic, and she was a mean drunk. She beat all of us when she drank, and she drank all the time. We were often left alone and we were forced to fend for ourselves. She was a horrible woman, and I was glad when she died.".
