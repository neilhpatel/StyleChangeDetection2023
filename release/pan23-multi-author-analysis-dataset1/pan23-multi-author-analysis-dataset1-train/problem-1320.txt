However, it sounds like you'd be willing to consider them paying you the backpay rent that they double-dipped on. Not only should you get back the monthly rent that you paid, but you should also get back an extra month or two for the trespassing while showing the unit. It's likely that they won't add that to their initial consideration, hoping that you won't think of that. Take pictures, or have your friend take pictures, and see about talking to neighbors. Explain that your just trying to see if the company trespassed for multiple months, and that your trying to gather information against the landlord. Some people will jump at the chance, I'm sure, to help you out. No landlord is universally liked, I think. This may help you quite a bit.
Technically correct but I do not know how NY would handle the landlord's behavior (my state the cause of action would be fraud or conversion) so I just stuck with the normal case and assumed OP is smart enough to invert the positions when speaking to NY counsel.
