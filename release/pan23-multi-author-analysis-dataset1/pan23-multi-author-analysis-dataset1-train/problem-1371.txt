- There is a realistic possibility that the Russian authorities are promoting defensive preparations within internationally recognised Russian territory to burnish patriotic feeling. However, it probably illustrates some Russia decision-makers' genuine (but false) belief that there is a credible threat of invasion by Ukrainian forces.
- Paucity in strategic assessment is one of the critical weaknesses in the central Russian government architecture: as highlighted by Russia's original decision to invade Ukraine. Impartial official analysis is almost certainly frequently undermined by a tendency toward group-think and politically expedient conclusions.
Ah, yes. Can’t ask any questions about human rights, then? Of course, the Russians would have to believe in human rights in the first place for the “council” to mean anything.
Optimistic. I suspect they won't do anything so sensible and will instead go looking for a much smaller, less well-defended nation to invade in order to 'restore Russian pride'.
