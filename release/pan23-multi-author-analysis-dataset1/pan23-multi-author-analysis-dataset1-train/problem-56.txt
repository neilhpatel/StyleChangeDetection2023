In financial services industry, we couldn’t accept anything. Worth over $100 also that meant flying on someone’s jet. If you did you’re out of the industry and unemployable. It would be great if we had ethical standards for elected officials that actually were enforced and by that I mean they should be terminated immediately, you are in the corporate sector why so elected officials get such a pass? Our elected officials appear more like a corruption-raddled third world kleptocracy more than honest persons representing the best interests of the citizens. If you look at their fiscal record, approaching $33 trillion in debt, seems like they should be in prison for fiscal fraud, like Enron and Worlcom CEO’s. The big difference is that they are protected by their parties and political donations.
