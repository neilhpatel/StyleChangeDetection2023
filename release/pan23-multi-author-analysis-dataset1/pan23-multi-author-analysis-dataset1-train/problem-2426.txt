I don't know about that. While Warnock is leading in polls, some of the polls show Walker voters are slightly more enthusiastic about voting. See the last page of crosstabs here:
Exactly! I sometimes wonder if voters actually pay zero attention to who and what is on the ballot, but just go, "Eenie, meenie, miny-mo," and vote for the name they like the sound of the best. Maybe they remember the name Herschel Walker from his football days and just vote for him because of that, having no clue what he represents or stands for. I can't think of any other reason that any sane person of average intelligence would vote for that knucklehead.

GOP had multi-decades coordinated effort on defunding education. The result is people increasingly rely on propaganda, whether through government, religious leaders, or conspiracy sites to get their "information" instead of applying critical thinking.
Youth turnout is also down a bit in the early vote. There are other potential warning signs. I think it's going to end up scary close. I'm praying that Warnock pulls off a win.
