This question is so broad, the answer will depend pretty much entirely on what you want it to be. It would be easy to name many cases in which war produced technological innovations, but just as easy to cite many cases in which it didn't. Whichever point you want to prove, you can pick your examples to match. Someone who reads the question and thinks immediately of the World Wars will say "competitive arms development, and the wartime challenges of logistics and medical care, contribute to technological invention and improvement in ways that might otherwise have taken longer, if they would have happened at all." But someone who thinks of, say, the Peloponnesian War might answer "war is only a destructive force; the priorities and costs of war actually inhibit any technological development that might otherwise have received the necessary funding, manpower and thought." Whole swathes of human history attest to the fact that endemic warfare often produces anarchy and poverty, not innovation and technological change.
But there are several we don't know about. E.g. the transition from "outswinging" to "inswinging" palintone and euthytone ballistae/catapultae that occurred probably in the late 2nd Century AD. The Romans figured out inswingers shoot further (a lot further, up to a kilometer+). How or why? We don't know. It was probably ad hoc, but certainly enabled by the development of metal-framed engines.
