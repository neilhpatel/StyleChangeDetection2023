I’m sorry that this has been your experience. I was not suggesting that you call the cops. I was suggesting that you seek out medical attention for your injury…generally antibiotics and maybe a tetanus shot (if not up to date). You are likely covered by workman’s compensation through the contractor whereby you were employed.
Much appreciated. And I know nobody said, which is why I said “to those that may say”. And yeah I know it’s federally illegal which is why I can’t claim workmans comp really. I mean I could but it’s so risky doing the fake pee thing. It’s fucking criminal that people have to deal with this bullshit, being between a rock and a hard place. I could be a complete fucking drunk and not worry about my employment, but because I smoke something that lasts 2 hours, is literally one of the safest drugs to consume, it’s held against me. And not just for the active amount in my blood but fucking remnants from months or even a year ago… I fucking hate this country and all it’s hypocritical, backwards Puritan ideology and horseshit laws.
