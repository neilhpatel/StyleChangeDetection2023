I’m really sorry for this situation. The powers that be are so focused on aiding tenants, that they fail to see the impact on the landlord. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the assistance they’re giving, but it can be a little short sighted. I had to evict someone on a lease violation. They hadn’t paid rent since day one of the pandemic (was not impacted in any way). They owe us $25k, and we’ll never see a penny.
To my understanding you still have to make an effort to pay rent unless the tenant is going to move prior to the eviction court date or is waiting to see if the landlord will provide information for the relief fund or something else but to my understanding most landlords that don’t want to move forward with the eviction relief fund and want to evict have a understanding that the tenant isn’t going to pay. Idk about CA but in KY if the landlord accepts any funds from the tenant after the landlord has issued the intent to evict then the landlord cannot file a eviction at the courts bc said landlord accepted funds. Of course this is only for non-payment of rent. Also, if said tenant does provide money after landlords intent to file eviction and the landlord still filed through the court then the tenant needs to make sure to document the date and amount given to the landlord so that the tenant can show the judge that the landlord is still accepting payments whether they are full amount or not.
