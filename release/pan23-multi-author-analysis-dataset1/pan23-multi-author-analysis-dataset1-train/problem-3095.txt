Even if your employer doesn't meet the $500k threshold, it's very likely that either you (as an employee) or they (as an employer) are and would therefore be covered under the FLSA regardless. The definition of "interstate commerce" is extremely broad, and basically covers engaging in any way with any person or entity outside of the state in which the business operates. Even things as simple as regularly communicating with people outside the state via telephone or email is generally enough. Even if your employer somehow never does any of those activities, the fact that you are organizing a conference alone is likely more than sufficient to place you under the FLSA for the duration of your work involving that conference at least (unless the conference only involves attendees, vendors, and businesses from within Ohio exclusively).
No, it's not legal. They don't have to pay you, for example, to watch TV, sniff coke off a hooker's ass, or sleep in your hotel room, but if you're on the job, you're on the clock. That's standard labor law anywhere in the United States. All time must be paid, and hours over 40 must be paid time-and-a-half.
