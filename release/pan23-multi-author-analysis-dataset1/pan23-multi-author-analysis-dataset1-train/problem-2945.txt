If your father died as an Illinois resident, regardless of whether or not there is a Will, a probate estate must be opened to appoint or approve a Representative; either an Executor (Will) or Administrator (No-Will). If you were a minor, likely a Guardian of your Estate was appointed. It may be the Estate Rep or another person, such as your mother or legal guardian. The easiest way to find out if a probate estate was properly opened is to search your county circuit clerk's website. If the county does not have their own search function, dockets are likely available at (they manage most smaller county's dockets in IL). As an heir, you have a right to request an accounting from the Estate Rep, and that person has to provide written documentation, with evidence such as receipts, of all income and debts paid by the estate, as well as indicate the current balance. You can do some background research; however, I would suggest you obtain an experienced probate attorney, preferably one who has experience with probate litigation and disputed estates, not simply filing the paperwork.
Stop speaking to the POA. Call your state bar and get attorney contact information to speak to an attorney. It is very likely the POA has spent all the money and now your only recourse will be to sue the POA to find out what happened to the money.
