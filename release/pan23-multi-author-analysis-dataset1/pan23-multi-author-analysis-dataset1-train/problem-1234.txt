Everything that came out of her mouth was from another reality. She talks about Republicans being the party of freedom? They want to tell you who you can love, who you can marry, they will force you to have a baby whether you want to or not even if it kills you, they don't even want you to have access to birth control. They want your children to be put in a menstrual registry! You can't make this shit up, I know I couldn't. She waxxed poetic about the president's secret scary mission to Iraq. I looked it up, it was a cluster fuck . He made a 3 hour stop on his way to Germany and managed to enraged the Iraqis and revealed the faces of a covert seal team so good fucking job dear leader. I realized that bullshit is their stock and trade a long time ago but I think they lie to themselves the hardest.

No actual policy proposals. No true ideas to help struggling Americans. Just baseless culture war antics and BS. WHY THE HELL DO PEOPLE STILL VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS.
