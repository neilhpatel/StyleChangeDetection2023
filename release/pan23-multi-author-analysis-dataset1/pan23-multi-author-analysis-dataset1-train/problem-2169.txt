There is _absolutely_ nothing you, as a tenant, can do to force the landlord's hand. In fact, you can't even force them to evict. Your landlord is responsible to you for repairing the damage to your unit, but not for enforcing an eviction against your neighbours. _The police_ are responsible for public order, including prosecuting people for negligent discharge, and jail time would remove them from the unit. You've already started the ball rolling on that.
There are rules about evictions, and depending on where in WA you are, they get even more difficult (for example, Seattle is still under an eviction moratorium for at least another few days, winter eviction moratorium continues until March 1st, there are laws about when households with students can be evicted, also if this involves domestic violence it gets trickier too).
Everything about your post is wrong. This case has nothing to do with quiet enjoyment, nor is the landlord breaking it. OP is not owed compensation by his landlord, and withholding rent on his part would be a ridiculous and illegal move.
