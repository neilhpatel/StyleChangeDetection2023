My big issue was the implication that it was only Born On The Fourth Of July and working on the 1981 concert that influenced the song, when Vietnam had been a major aspect of his life long before (and re-reading my comment it definitely feels to me more combative than intended). Carlin's biography is a pretty decent read and does feature a lot of great information, but there's more than a few sections where he kind of gets lazy and fudges some details for the sake of brevity. Bruce does mention original E Street Band drummer Vinny "Mad Dog" Lopez constantly being in trouble with the law and being given the choice between military service and prison (seems he took prison every time). The others I mentioned above, especially Cichon, were mentioned by Bruce as direct inspirations for "Born In The USA.".
The Hendrix example I really chose mainly because it was a fairly prominent one in pop culture by that point, and one that I'd expect Springsteen to be aware of; as a pop songwriter, Springsteen was always profoundly interested in his connection with the audience, and my thinking was that stuff like the Hendrix example floating around in pop culture would have helped that line connect. Similarly, the Born On The Fourth Of July book and the fundraising concert were simply proximal to the writing of the song, and so relevant to discuss - but I completely agree that good songwriters like Springsteen don't just write about what is right in front of them, and that the narrator in Born In The USA is an amalgam both of what he experienced around the time of writing, but is also influenced by the Vietnam myths and tropes in pop culture, and as you say, his friends like Haynes and Cichon.
How true would be the opposite? Arlo Guthrie's Alice's Restaurant tells that Arlo was not allowed into the army due to his garbage dumping shenanigans.
