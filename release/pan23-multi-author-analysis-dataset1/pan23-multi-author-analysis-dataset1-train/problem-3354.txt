Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we're letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as 'Why didn't X do Y' relatively often don't get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, 'why didn't X do Y' questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It's worth remembering that people in the past couldn't see into the future, and they generally didn't have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn't necessarily look that way at the time.
Thanks for the reply! While I knew about the paratrooper helmet, mainly from the uniform of the 6th Airbourne, I never really knew about the turtle helmet's use the in the war. I also knew that the civilians would sometimes use helmets, but didn't realise the differences between domestic and frontline helmets. All of that's really interesting information. It's also interesting to see that most of the implemented changes in British helmet design came quite close to the end of the war, which is why I suppose I only really associated the Brodie helmet with British infantry in World War 2.
