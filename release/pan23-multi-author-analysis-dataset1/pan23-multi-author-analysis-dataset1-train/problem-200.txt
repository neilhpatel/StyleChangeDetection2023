Im considered a Democrat and would believe myself to be heavily armed. You are heavily misinformed by the faux news propaganda machine. Yet to meet a Republican at the range that can outshoot me with a handgun. I love to see their faces once I make it known I am a "lib".
>I, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.
Right-wing conspiracy theories always lack an actor capable of carrying out the theory. Did Trump eliminate the Deep State? Did He put Hillary in jail? Who exactly terminates the Constitution?
Edit: I see this was a tweet he published then deleted. Tired of bullshit artists getting to hide behind one-way social media like that.
