There is an unwarranted cynicism in this post. Constantine’s mother Helena was a Christian and so he was exposed to the religion from an early age and was probably more sympathetic to Christians than his predecessors on that account, though he was publicly an adherent of Roman paganism in his early years. Eusebius of Caesarea is the primary source for the famous story of his vision at the battle of Milvian Bridge in which he saw a cross in the sun and heard the words “in this sign you will conquer” and although we will never know whether he truly had a religious experience we do know from independent sources that on his return from the battle he ignored the altar to the Roman gods at Capitoline and did not participate in the traditional celebratory sacrifices that were performed after a victorious return from battle, suggesting some change in how he regarded the Roman religion that happened some time between going into battle and returning, and the next year he decreed the Edict of Milan which made the empire religiously neutral and gave official toleration to Christians. At this point Christians were a growing minority, especially in the Eastern and Greek speaking parts of the empire but the Roman elite was almost entirely pagan and imperial power was not seriously threatened by Christians.
To be honest, I don't think he's a Marxist. Usually he was (from what I remember anyway) more even handed about religion and historical figures, but he basically seems to have come to the conclusion that Constantine was pretty much being political about it.
