It is all fun and games until one of these events does destroy a historic piece. These people aren't the most intelligent so it only takes one time for it to end up doing something that can't be undone. Other activists have previously damaged art, there's literally a rich history of people attacking art as a form of protest, it starts with the glass and wall next to it then ends up with paintings slashed when people sigh in relief.
Oh yea! This is awesome, they use oil to….protest oil? Or something like that. I guess it’s like wearing a dead animal to show you’re against killing animals. Pretty smart.
Why, when we literally face extinction at least people will die do we(our collective internet conciousness) still care more about some aesthetically pleasing paint more than people, dying, starving and so on(because of climate change)?
