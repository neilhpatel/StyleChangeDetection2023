Now an archer can only aim at one target at a time, so there's no helping that (hitori ate no shōbu literally means "victory or defeat aimed at one person"), but here's a scene in . You can see the samurai had their bows drawn at the same time and were close to each other. You can't fight a duel like that. The words say Shiroishi Rokurō Michiyasu, his force of over a hundred knights, charges forth from the rear rank. A force of 100 samurai charging at once is no way to duel. Since Suenaga personally fought in the battle, while he probably exaggerated his own deeds he must have asked the artist to depict the combat at least somewhat accurately. If his scroll does not include one single instance of dueling, not even himself (he does depict himself charging ahead and putting some foes to flight in 1274) we have no reason to think there was dueling, or any attempt at dueling.
That's interesting. So, were samurai essentially not compensated for their service in a given battle unless they had witnesses to corroborate their deeds to the bakufu? Or were the rewards essentially a "bonus" for showing valor?
