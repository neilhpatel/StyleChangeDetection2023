This Democratic affiliation meant urban politicians and the urban elites had, for decades, been in an alliance with slaveholders. For some it was an alliance of convenience and an increasingly uncomfortable one. A few broke broke ranks in 1856 and 1860 and voted Republican over the issue of slavery, most notably Boston. But most Democrats, and by extension most cities' politicians, were at least moderately pro-slavery. The difference between the Northern Democrats and Southern Democrats were how pro-slavery they were and their acceptance of radical action to preserve slavery. But neither was Abolitionist. New York was particularly noted to be a hotbed of pro-Southern sentiment. And, then as now, was noted for its arts scene. (Remember, John Wilkes Booth was an actor.).
Just a clarifying question, I remember reading a famous biography about Lincoln that came out in the early 20th century so it might be dated, but I recall it was pretty clear that at least Lincoln's early childhood was utterly destitute. His father was an impulsive spender, an alcoholic, and a drifter. I think he bought some rough-to-farm territory and built a 3-sided (open) shack where they spent some of the coldest winters. Did their situation improve later?
