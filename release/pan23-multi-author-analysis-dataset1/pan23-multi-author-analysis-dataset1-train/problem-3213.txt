Also Im shocked no one has pointed out the Illegal detainment, harassment, retaliation. I was awoken and immediatley deemed detained as the police were already searching my stuff. u/Azpathfinder.
Whether it’s a bogus charge or not, the only way to fight it is with an attorney. Filing a complaint with the department won’t get you out of the charge(s), and being convicted even for a small charge could have life long impacts. You should be contacting an attorney today. Indiana might have procedures around assigning a public defender if you can’t afford an attorney so that might be an option depending on income.
Okay makes sense. Im still going to file a complaint as I feel the officers need to hopefully be addressed in some type of way. If i do file a complaint, Do you know if the complaint could make its way to the courts hands? I'm hoping the judge is given a copy or something but Im afraid it will be pushed under the rug or something. I plan on just making copies and handing them to my lawyer when I find one. Most likely a public defender if i dont decide to go pro se.
