Patton (a) distrusted Soviet aims, and (b) felt that the US had an advantage if it came to war with the Soviet Union, and (c) that advantage would decrease with time. However, he did not advocate such a war, and did not want to fight the Soviets. He felt that the US should negotiate from a position of strenh, if necessary supported by the threat of force. He believed that this would result in Soviet compliance without war.
The Soviets prepared plans for war with the West. Again, this doesn't mean that there was any intent for war against the West. However, at least some of their plans may have gone beyond the hypothetical level of Operation Unthinkable, possibly in response to intelligence reports about Operation Unthinkable. When Operation Unthinkable became public knowledge in 1998, historian John Erickson (author of The Road to Stalingrad and The Road to Berlin), commented.
Btw. it is true, that Operation Unthinkable included to arm some German POWs and let them fight? Would that be Wehrmacht and or SS troops? Would be allies really arm SS troops?
Also, the Soviet Union paid suitable attention to the Yalta agreements, setting up acceptable governments, and using Soviet-supported revolutions and rigged elections to get pro-Soviet communist governments into power in the longer term (a few years - the Polish "free" elections were held in 1947, and Poland became a communist state in 1949). Essentially, the Soviet Union followed the letter of the Yalta agreements well enough, while violating their spirit.
