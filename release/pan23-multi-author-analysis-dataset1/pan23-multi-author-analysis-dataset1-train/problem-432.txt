Remember when Kevin McCarthy, in his previous attempt to get the gavel, went on television and straight-up said that the Benghazi "investigations" were intended to hurt Hillary Clinton's poll numbers? Yeah. Kevin's not the brightest bulb in the box.
Eh, if the goal is to not accomplish anything so that the extremely enormous chunk of the electorate that doesn't remember or pay attention to anything that isn't happening actively in front of their face can get disgruntled at the fact that "the government isn't doing anything to solve our problems" and then, like an earthworm wriggling its way through the dirt, mindlessly vote for the other side (Republicans) this time around because maybe that will change things....then maybe this is going exactly as planned?
McCarthy is MTG's sock puppet. He sold the tiny scrap of soul he still possessed to get the gavel, and he does not care about anything beyond that. Everyone in the House knows he is nothing but a placeholder, and all of the Republicans are fine with it.
