Really? It’s going to be 2 straight years of him being kicked in the nuts. I would have preferred democrats holding the house, I’m actually somewhat excited about getting to watch it. Imagine trying to coral moderate republicans in endangered seats while also having to appease MTG and if 4 congressmen back out of any deal, you get personally blamed for shutting down the country. He has to get a very fractured party to corral around any legislation and he has almost literally no room for error.
Seriously. I was watching the news yesterday and they were having a panel discussion about Warnock and the midterms. Someone made a comment about how well the GOP did in comparison to Trump endorsed candidates. One of the comments was something like, "Republicans won in all their elections in GA except the Senate.".

Thankfully. Had the projected red wave came I would have lost my bank account and my rights to work, drive etc. Still though I am worried that the next time Rs get power, then that will be the end of the road for me getting by without having to reliant on someone else, I am just expecting the next time Republicans take control, then I WILL lose my rights to drive, work, own/rent my own property, and have my own bank account and credit cards.
