Your doctor can only give you advice. They can't force you to follow it1. It's up to you whether you trust your doctor's advice or not, it's up to you whether to follow it, and it's up to you whether to try to work with your doctor to adjust treatments that aren't working or whether to withdraw from their care.
The only thing your doctor can do if you won't follow their advice is fire you as a patient, and if you're at the point where you don't feel they are able to help you, ending the relationship may be the best outcome.
Thank you! And also, thank you for being respectful. I’ve had to delete posts on places like this because I don’t know much about the law (hence me coming here for help) and was treated so harshly for wanting some info. You’ve been awesome, and I appreciate you, internet stranger. I hope you have a great weekend .
Patients have a responsibility to advocate for themselves, as much as doctors have a responsibility to treat competently. I understand the difficulties of that - doctors not trusting patients, particularly women, around mental health is unfortunately very widespread - but I don't see any legal recourse here.
Thank you! I needed to know if it was a situation that was ready or not. I have a big letter written for my next appointment where I am asking for the logic behind prescribing me a med I was suicidal on, if he actually knows how to treat mental health, etc. So he’s going to get the most assertive, pissed off girl he’s ever seen. I truly want to live, and doctors like him are the reason it’s been so hard. He needs to know that, and he needs to do his damn job and treat my illness, not exasperate it lol.
