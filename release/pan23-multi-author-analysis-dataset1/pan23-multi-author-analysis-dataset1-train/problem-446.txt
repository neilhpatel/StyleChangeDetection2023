The Sub is the Belgorod. Which was basically designed by committee and is supposed to do a wide variety of different tasks. It was initially laid down in 1992 but funding was cut soon afterwards. And it was left half built for several years. Then it was dramatically reworked to become a cruise missile carrier, to carry out sabotage e.g. against internet cables and Nord Stream (it seems to have been in the area shortly after it entered state trials, having been launched from St. Petersburg). As well as carrying 6-8 long range nuclear powered, nuclear torpedos. The Russians have claimed thst it carries a 100MT warhead "salted" with Cobalt. Claiming that detonating a torpedo off the coast of the US would cause a Mega Tsunami thst would drive water several hundred miles inland with the cobalt making the land uninhabitable for about 200 years. Or would make the UK and Ireland completely uninhabitable. Which seems to be a major exageration. Most likely it only has a 1-2 Megaton warhead and no cobalt. Which would cause problems for a port or coastal city. Even a 100 MegaTon explosion wouldn't cause the damage that the Russians claim.
From the article: "The Poseidon torpedo is a nuclear-powered unmanned underwater vehicle" capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear munitions. Its nuclear propulsion system gives the Poseidon virtually limitless range.".
The torpedo isn't nuclear-powered, the submarine is. The torpedo can be armed with a nuclear warhead, but there's a zero percent chance Russia would be doing live tests.
