In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Last year a Democrat in my district, with virtually no support from the Democratic party, lost a house seat to a Republican by 2.3%. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez also received little to no support from the Democratic party and ended up winning a heavily Republican leaning district.
