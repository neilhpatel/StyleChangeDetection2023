Pundits keep framing our 'political situation' as the predictable struggles that come within a functioning two party government. That framing supports the observable war treasonous Republicans are waging on the democracy, the Constitution and the people of the United States. We need to frame the Republican war on the United States, the same way we reported on the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. Republicans are not a rudderless political party - they are the aggressor in a war they started against the United States. Unite, organize and mobilize in defense of democracy and the people of the United States.
Rudderless? The house GOP is clueless. 18 GOP free agents are now setting agenda. Squander resource and squander political opportunities, that will be McCarthy’s legacy.
Right? This is literally his creation from the “terrible politics lab” that he brought to life. This monster is grown now and just wandering through villages destroying everything it comes into contact with.
