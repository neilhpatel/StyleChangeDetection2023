Mountain living makes you tough, literally walking anywhere is a battle. Most mountains are still wild so gotta contend with nature quite a bit. Few people move to the mountains, most are from them and from people that had a harder time living than modern technology has allowed today. Also, mountains don't really allow weak, stupid people to live on them, natural selection takes care of them. And to begin with, if your ancestors moved to and settled in the mountains it was so they couldn't be told what to do by governments and cities. Most civilizations over time have had rebel "mountain people" be a thorn in their side their entire existence lol.
Exactly. They Russian leaders won't see it as a mistake in assignment but a mistake in that they never should have had training wasted on them. Infantry keep getting shredded so they need more. So that's where they'll go.
Absolutely pathetic. Can't believe this sack of shit has brought so much pain and suffering over the past year. And he has the nerve to stand in a church as if he gives a single fuck about anything remotely christ-like.
