Muhammad, on the other hand, and depending on your perspective of early Islam, had a more social role. Hence, it was political as well religious leadership. On Muhammad and the early spread of Islam, I can think of no one better than Patricia Crone (Princeton, Cambridge, Oxford, Warburg). She was a respected scholar in early Islam, passed away in 2015. Here's a good summary of why she is "". Her books are brilliant.
Now, it's useless to become fatalist and portray this as the inherent destiny of all empires - it might be kind of technically true in an entropy-like sense, but it tells us nothing of why and how these empires fell. And I think the problem with the comparison between Alexander and Muhammad (whether we take Muhammad to have been a conquest-hungry expansionist or not, a question that remains controversial) is that it falls apart beyond a kind of general sense of their peoples serving peripheral auxilliary functions to empires.
In any event, I would say that the sooner you step away from the specific example of comparing Muhammad to Alexander, the better, not least because of the occasionally troubling historiography of Alexander's campaigns and the preconceived notions we tend to carry into any study of his conquests.
