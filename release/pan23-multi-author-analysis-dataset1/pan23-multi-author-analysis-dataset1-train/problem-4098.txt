For starters, The Four of Breda only acquired their moniker about a decade after the war. During late April and early May of 1945 all of them had been arrested or captured on Dutch soil, and between 1945 and 1952 they had been incarcerated in the Norgerhaven Prision in the town of Veenhuizen. At first they awaited their trial there, thereafter their sentence, and finally the execution of their sentence. Each individually they had been proven war criminals, accountable for the deaths of Dutch citizens of all kinds; resistance fighters, Dutch Jews, bystanders, collateral damage etc.. They were each individually notorious for decisions they made or actions they undertook. In finality, even after trial by an independent judge in the overall shaky court of law immediately after the war, they were all unanimously sentenced to death for their crimes. As early as December 1949 these sentences were passed, but not executed.
Interesting. Did Kotalla, or anyone else, try to claim that he was legally insane, or was the brain damage the psychiatrist found not significant enough?
