It's a moot point right now, as the board of directors has the size specified for it in the articles (as amended, as far as you can tell). If they were in violation of the articles, they seem to have fixed that, even if the current board are not willing to clearly commit to keeping it that way or to repealing the ambiguous bylaw or amending the articles to support it.
If the only language in the articles is this clause regarding amendment and a clear statement that the number of seats is three, then there are three seats until the articles are amended. There is no fourth or fifth board member. Someone acting as a board member anyways is acting outside the scope of the corporate documents; allowing the board to operate this way puts the board at some risk of litigation to figure out whether, for example, they have allowed some random person to spend the company's money.
2. Understand how it works in general, so I can be a responsible member. There's a lot of misinformation and confusion, mostly due to this current board and them not telling the members details of their activity.
