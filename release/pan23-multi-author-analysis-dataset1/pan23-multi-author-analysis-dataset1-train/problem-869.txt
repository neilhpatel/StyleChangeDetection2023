Israel is no friend of the US. Theyve murdered US citizens before. They hack and steal from the US and its allies. They are an apartheid terrorist state and theyre one of the most dangerous countries on earth. Violent right wing nationalists are a danger to every single one of us.

No, actually. As recently as 2008 under then PM Olmert the Palestinians were offered a state of their own in 97% of the West Bank, with the other 3% covered under land swaps with Israel, full control of the Jordan Valley after 10 years and a capitol in East Jerusalem...virtually everything they say they want. It was still rejected.
