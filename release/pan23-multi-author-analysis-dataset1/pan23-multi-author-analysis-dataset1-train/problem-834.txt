The Democratic Party in general has seen a massive morale boost under him, and we're seeing more falling in line behind Biden's agenda, which is progressive as possible under current conditions. Especially after the State of the Union, we are seeing Dems following in his footsteps and using the talking points he outlines to attack Republicans.
Seriously. All I ever hear from progressives is how much they hate moderates. Party unity is supposed to be a two way street, but progressives seem to think that it's merely that they can unilaterally impose while consistently showing hostility to the people they want to "unify" with.
Did we learn nothing from RBG? Democrats bring disappointing nominees and then act surprised when they lose. I have nothing against Biden. I think he’s doing a great job… but I also think we are a country full of many smart people and I can’t believe we as a party believe he is the best we have for the next election… really?? There’s not one other democrat who is even slightly younger and could do a better job??
