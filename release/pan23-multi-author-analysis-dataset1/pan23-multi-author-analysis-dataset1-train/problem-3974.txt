This would seem to suggest there is some uneasiness among Russian citizens about the war in Ukraine. We have been hearing that the war against Ukraine enjoys much support by Russians but there seems to be a segment of Russians who at least understand that their armies are committing atrocities. Am I correct or have I missed something?
Any opposition who are truly independent. End up chased out of politics. Jailed like navalny. Or shot dead in the street like boris nemtsov.
An extremely small minority mostly consisting of young, educated, liberal, urban individuals.... and even then, it's questionable.
"Test"? Test of what? Everybody knows the elections in Russia are some of the biggest jokes on the planet. (Unmonitored) Russian citizens would be the first to tell you that much. It's not like they've been somehow fooled into thinking Putin legitimately won all elections, and legitimately changed the law to give himself unlimited mandates.
The only thing this would be useful for would be convincing Russians who, by some miracle, have not noticed that Putin's "elections" are criminal and laughable - but at this point, I can't say I believe that any Russian who acts like this is any more than just a Putin supporter that acts apathetic.
