I presume OP meant simply "airplanes" and not specifically "jets". Based on a rash assumption slight understanding of the ranges and uses of the few WW2 jet aircraft, I suspect that none of them flew over, and none were shot down over, enemy territory. Would this be correct?
Likewise Allied aircrew over Germany faced a hostile populace, particularly later in the war as the combined bombing offensive dramatically increased in scale, up to 1,500 being killed by lynching or mob violence. Few evaded capture, and though there were escapes from prison camps (as popularised by e.g. The Great Escape) less than 30 RAF personnel reached Britain or neutral territory after being captured.
The best chance for Allied aircrew was if they landed in occupied territory (e.g. France, Belgium, The Netherlands), where a number of operated, assisting escapers and evaders (often aircrew), at enormous personal risk. RAF aircrew were given instruction on escape and evasion, and issued with an "Aids Box" containing "compressed food, Chewing Gum, Halazone, Benzadrine, Matches, Safety Razor and Soap, Needle and Thread, Surgical Tape, Fishing Line and Hook, Water Bottle and small compass". The kits were issued by MI9 along with silk maps, purses containing foreign currency, and more than two million compasses of various designs including ones designed to be hidden . The aim was "to give the evader sufficient nourishment for 48 hours and so enable him to lie up or move from his original location without the necessity of obtaining food", with the maps then offering the chance to find a town where help could be sought. MI9 reported that 4,657 British Commonwealth personnel evaded capture over the war.
