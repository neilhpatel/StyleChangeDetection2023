How the fuck could they let this happen? Would they have ignored even 2 or 3 deaths in America or Canada? Forget 6,500.
He took so much responsibility of course that he even refused to co-operate with FIFA's white washed enquiry, declining to answer questions, which eventually led FIFA to shrug their shoulders and say what can we do? Beckenbauer refuses to answer questions, so we can't conclude anything. Everything must OK then?
This is such a patently absurd argument to justify the fact that one of the most corrupt organizations in the world, FIFA, awarded the World Cup to Qatar back in 2010 because the vote was completely rigged as a result of bribery. That's pretty obvious at this point. Now other World Cup votes have probably had some measure of shenanigans as well. But what made that vote particularly egregious was the whole weather situation when the World Cup is traditionally held. And then the organizing committee tried to convince us all the stadiums would have this space-age air conditioning technology. How did that promise work out? In the end, you can't hide behind so-and-so country's history to give Qatar a pass over the fact that thousands of workers died constructing these stadiums. Anybody with half a brain and a full conscience can see right through you. And it's actually kind of funny that a country swimming in Monopoly money via the oil and gas industry is trying to play the colonialism victim card to deflect criticism of the atrocities that took place on their watch. Gimme a break, man.
explaining later: "In order to get a subsidy from FIFA [for the organisation of the 2006 World Cup] those involved went ahead with a proposal from the FIFA finance commission that in today's eyes should have been rejected. I, as president of the then-organising committee, bear the responsibility of this mistake.".
