We can look at Gibbons, The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776) as both a history (a secondary source) about ancient Roman, and as a primary source that can be used to consider eighteenth-century culture and point of view. In the same way, we can look at the Vedas at an attempt to document and understand an ancient past - as a first attempt at the historical process - and as a primary source that describes religion, faith, and the society during the time when the Vedas took shape.
Umm... So the conclusion that I am deriving from this is that mythology is exaggerated stories of real life events and people and that they become history when sufficient proof is available to corroborate the evidence? Is that right?
The point that I'm trying to make with these examples is that ancient human societies didn't have the fundamental scientific knowledge to explain their experiences such we can understand directly, so they often codify information into stories, or as we call them today, myths, which get incrementally changed over the centuries. A man becomes a king. A king becomes a god, etc.. We can see this clearly in the ancient Greek myth of a sea monster named Charybdis who would drink the ocean and suck ships down to the bottom of the sea. It is now known that.
