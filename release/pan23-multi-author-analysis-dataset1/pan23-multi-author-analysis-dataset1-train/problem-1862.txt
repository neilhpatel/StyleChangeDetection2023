Columns were not simple crowds; they consisted of distinct companies formed up in line behind each other. Within the company, men in 18th-19th century armies were assigned their place in the line generally based on their height; Brunswick armies put the tallest men with the best mustaches in the first rank, while in America, the company lined up from tallest to shortest, with every three men making a file.
The Whites of their Eyes by Paul Lockhart. A very readable breakdown of the Battle of Bunker Hill, its tactical and strategic decisions, and the state of both the American and British forces. An excellent book.
Engineers/saboteurs/sappers-- the French called these "pioneers" and like skirmishers they weren't typically in formation, rather they accomplished special functions. On defense they constructed trenches, on the attack they broke open fortified positions; they'd have been in column for movement, but not when actually fighting . . .
In the early phase of the Napoleonic Wars, each battalion had six fusilier companies and two 'flanker' companies of grenadiers and light infantry; these would often be detached from the main body of the battalion, leaving the battalion with three divisions of two companies. As such, the typical column formation was two companies abreast and three deep. Later, the army was reorganized into battalions of six companies, four being fusiliers. When the flanker companies were detached, they formed up one company across and four deep. The Austrian 'battalion mass' was a similar formation, but with six companies. They were often deployed with significant intervals between divisions, to facilitate deployment into line.
