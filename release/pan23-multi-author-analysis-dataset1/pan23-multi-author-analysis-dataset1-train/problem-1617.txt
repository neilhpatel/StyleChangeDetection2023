There were also vigilante groups formed by Jews who had survived the Holocaust - while most able bodied Jewish men and women put their energy into rebuilding or going to assist the war effort in Israel, some Jews instead opted to focus on enacting revenge upon their former oppressors. There was a feeling that the Nuremberg trials (and the smaller associated ones) did not even come close to achieving justice for the victims. A few Jewish volunteers decided therefore to take matters into their own hands. The most notable of these groups are are Nakam and Tilhas Tizig Gesheften. Nakam is mainly known for its attempts at mass poisoning; as sympathetic as their background might be, it was by all reasonable definitions a terrorist group. Initially there was a plan to poison the water supply of the entire city of Nuremberg, as the Nakam leaders believed every man woman and child in Germany should pay in blood for the Shoah. But this was discovered and collapsed due to logistical issues. The plan was then refined to poisoning bread being shipped to a prison that was holding SS personnel prior to their trials. The goal was to poison the entire camp, and the tainted bread indeed make its way into the prisoners' rations - however, despite 2,283 thousand prisoners becoming acutely sick in that time period and 207 being hospitalized in critical condition, there are not very good records kept on how many died from this specifically.

This is definitely interesting- but getting a bit closer to the OP's question, is there any known material on post-WWII assassinations carried out specifically by the Special Air Service, or other agents of the British government?
