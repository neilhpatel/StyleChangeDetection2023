That's totally fine just don't be surprised when the rest of the world hates you for it. We don't hate it because your doing with an anti US agenda we hate you for it because your supporting a terrorist state that's intentionally massacring civilians.
Ikr? These takes on reddit are so weird. I mean its US dominated and there is also tons of propaganda in the US and Americans also love accusing other countries of how bad their morals are while being one of the worst countries in this regard.
Yeah. The point kind of was that whilst US isn't a direct threat in terms of military, there are other means in which it can harm or threaten us with due to its where size, capital, power, military ext. It just simply has a very large sphere of influence within many different areas. All of which depends on the internal stability of US... Which has been increasingly polarised (not a secret).
Interesting! I must have mixed up with rape victims or some other sordid stat. I checked in Canada out of curiousity, we're doing a bit "better" with up to 30% murders being done by family members, must be because other types of murders are lower.
