They paid lip service to the notion that these were company cars in firm policy. If an associate had to drive to a deposition or to court somewhere, you were supposed to ask around to see if a partner had a car available before you drove your own car and submitted for mileage reimbursement. They did track mileage to some degree because clients were billed for mileage. At the same time, you were basically asking to borrow a partner's car and it was awkward, so it didn't happen. They were functionally the partners personal vehicles. But the Partners spent lots of time driving to depositions and court, so they were pretty justifiable and the issue was at the margins, were the cars 45% for work use or 65% for personal use?
Wonderful explanations. Iâ€™m a younger dentist. Just got a new job. Went through all these funny discussions with people trying to commit tax crimes to lower what they were paying me.
Realistically, that never happens. The business owner has a "company car" paid for by the business, but only a small fraction of the use is actual business use and there's no documentation. But the business pays for 100% of it.
