He has bragged of doing business with Russia's FSB (US FBI equivalent). He was caught at Moscow airport with $80,000 in cash, obviously for bribes. Money was at first confiscated and then returned to him so police could track who he was going to pay off with $80k. He was arrested by an FSB officer who Whelan iisted as is friend and contact.
