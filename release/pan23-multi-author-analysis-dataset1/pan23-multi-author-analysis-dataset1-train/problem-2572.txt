The problem is they are demonstrating that they can pull an unlimited amount of free money from the air to save lives in Ukraine, and that's well and good, but you know what else would save a bunch of lives, increase productivity, save money, and it generally make America better place all around, universal healthcare somehow though we never seem to have money for that.
What's the total at now? What's the maximum we should give to Ukraine? I think around $2.5 trillion, we should at least reassess if it's the best use of money. But up until that point, I think Ukraine's war effort is the best use of US money.
