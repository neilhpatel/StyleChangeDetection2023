On the other side there are some situations you could be out of pocket more than 1/3rd. If there is shared fault, like you were both negligent that will reduce what you are awarded. In some states like NC if you contributed even 1% you are barred from recovery. There are certain costs like court filing fees you may have to pay upfront even with a contingency fee. Some of these would not be recoverable, like for expert testimony that was gathered but not presented at trial before reaching a settlement(but most of them are, like the filing fee usually is). You may need further physical therapy or have medical bills that are not adequately calculated. If the at fault party is broke and has insurance with low limits or no insurance(and you don't have uninsured motorist bodily injury insurance) you may not recover what is owed.
Thank you for the reply! I'm not quite seeing how this works. If the lawyer is paid as a percent of the total settlement, what is their incentive to spend time negotiating with the doctors and hospitals to reduce the amount owed?
If, based on his insurance policy, they are only obliged to pay for his $10k medical expenses, how would the lawyer get them to pay $15k?
"then 80% of that $7k would go to the health insurance co" ... why is it only 80%, they don't get to recover the entire $8000 they paid out for medical expenses, from the vehicle insurance settlement? Where does 80% come from?
