The shortest answer is: the Pilgrims landed in Massachusetts, and eventually they and their people (Puritans/Congregationalists) created Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth. The Episcopalians had Columbia. The Presbyterians founded Princeton. The Baptists had Brown. The boys who went to these schools . . . were originally all trained as preachers. That would be a boring story if it ended there.
are Anglicans (not necessarily English) who regard Anglicanism as one branch of "Catholicism" as opposed to "Protestantism", (albeit a separate branch from "Roman Catholicism", with only the latter recognising Papal supremacy).
I grew up with a lot of FFV kids, and always thought of them as peak WASP. The (mostly Episcopal) prep school culture and fashion is still very strong. The families send a lot of kids to Ivies, although some certainly stay in the south.
There are entire books about what happened to the Puritans and the theological internal revolution in the 1700s, there is an American Revolutionary War centered in Boston, a religious schism between the Church of England/Anglican Church, the Puritans become the Congregationalists (Congos, as my very WASPy great-grandmother called them), the Church of England adherents became Episcopalians, etc. etc. New Bedford became a major whaling port, where great risk was undertaken in the "Moby Dick" era and great wealth was generated. Boston was one of the largest American cities.
