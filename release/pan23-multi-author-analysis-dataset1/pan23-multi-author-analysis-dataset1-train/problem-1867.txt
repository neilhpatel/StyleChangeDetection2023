It shouldn't matter whether there is medicinal value. I can understand the argument, to some extent, that drugs which are extremely addictive receive different treatment. But, what one wants to do with their body is up to the individual or their master.
Marijuana legalization is on the ballot in Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota next week, a reflection of the growing momentum nationwide to lift penalties once associated with the drug.
That language has a broken foundational premise. Why are we viewing drugs through that lens? Nowhere in the Constitution does it talk about drugs. It talks about rights being protected if not specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights. If I do a drug and have not infringed on anyone else's rights, what have I done wrong? I own my body and mind. It matters nothing at all whether what I put in my body has medicinal value. Double cheeseburgers are going to do more damage to me than many "drugs" ever could.
