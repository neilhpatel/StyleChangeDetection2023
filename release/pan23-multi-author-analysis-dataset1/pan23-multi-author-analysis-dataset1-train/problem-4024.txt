Once developing countries catch up with the west, we are all fucked. I went to Iraq last year and the consumerism is off the charts. So much China plastic junk all around.
Converting refrigeration systems to non-CFCs is relatively simple and inexpensive, and doesn't require reworking a business model.
Ya. That’s why people got forced into buying farm fresh eggs and organic pasture raised chicken meat… oh wait… no, that’s not true. Consumers literally asked for it and the marketplace adjusted its products to cater to them. Who would have thought! /s.
Converting single-use plastics to any other material is incredibly expensive, requires a reconstructed supply chain, new branding, new packaging, new sales methods, new storage systems, etc. Any replacement to single-use plastics will be less appealing to the majority of consumers. Not to mention plastic is sterile, non-biodegradable, has excellent strenh and ductility for it's weight. It's kind of a miraculous material. It's also cheap as hell.
Let's fund research into reducing single-use plastic by taxing private jets, private yachts, corporate-owned single-family homes, industrial use of water in the west, and churches.
You’re right. It’s the only example of consumers taking charge… there are literally no other examples, like Burger King expanding it’s Impossible Meat offerings due to consumer demand… oh, wait.
