This is a bad idea on multiple fronts, including the legal one. Waving a gun around while you're under a firearms prohibition is almost certain to land you back in jail one way or another. Separately, using _any_ gun the way you're describing is really hard to fit into the framework of self-defence exceptions: it's usually only effective _before_ you're in deadly danger, and if you use deadly force when you're not in imminent deadly danger, that's usually not self-defence.
No. A BB gun shouldn’t be kept in the car. Your car has door locks and a gas pedal. Maybe get yourself a can of mace to carry. Showing someone a BB gun is brandishing, and you can be sent to jail for this offense. I have conceal-carried for a decade and only once was afraid I might possible have to defend myself. And I never had to even look at the gun. I certainly wouldn’t have felt better had it been a BB gun. And a BB gun is of no use during a home invasion. Anyone wearing clothes that just kicked in a door won’t be intimidated with a BB gun. Get a large dog instead.
Arguing self-defence in response to a brandishing charge is usually quite challenging, because the number of situations where you're in such immediate danger that you can defend using deadly force, but simultaneously not in so much danger that you have to pull the trigger, is very small.
Brandishing a firearm - including an imitation firearm - in self-defence is generally construed as deadly force, on the premise that you are making a deadly threat whether you honestly intend to follow through or not. Is there a situation where deadly force would be justified, where a BB gun would also be adequate?
