Most suppliers want to be paid ASAP and you should discuss with your management if that is the way that they prefer for your company to do business--if they have the funds on hand to pay the bill, do they want to pay it immediately or not? The supplier's terms for payment are listed on the invoice: for example, the net amount due within 30 days or 60 days or 90 days.
