I didn’t reference anything regarding abandonment and divorce, because the sale of the property is the issue I’m speaking on - which took place before death of the conveyor. I only mentioned that her abandonment of the property, which took place before any divorce contemplations, could potentially impact the whether she still retained homestead rights in the property. However, the link I posted cited case law that said her leaving the property did not destroy those rights ( This was the central issue before the Florida Supreme Court in Estate of Scholtz, 543 So.2d 219 (Fla. 1989). In Scholtz, the Florida Supreme Court determined that even though a spouse had effectively abandoned her husband prior to death, left the marital home without the intention to return, that because the language in the constitution makes no reference to abandonment that it is not a relevant basis to overturn the constitutional protection. Id. That means for all practical purposes that if you are separated from your spouse (but not divorced) you cannot convey away your homestead residence even if your spouse no longer lives there and you hold title alone.).
When you’re talking about abandonment not counting during a divorce, that has to do with distribution of property between the parties during the divorce proceedings. If he was still alive, she would have a claim, because that wouldn’t be considered abandonment for the purposes of the divorce proceedings.
