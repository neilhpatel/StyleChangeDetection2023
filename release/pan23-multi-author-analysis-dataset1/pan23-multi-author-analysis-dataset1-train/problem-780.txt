which is funny because i think most people making those comments have just become too cynical themselves - "it's always been that way, it'll never change. in other news, water is wet" etc.
Everyone and anyone who works for a private company who is sent on a business trip would be sent in business class on a flight; to have benefits like a nice hotel, dinners (food) often entertainment paid etc as part of the 'schmoozing' required - typical company expenses that are subtracted from company profits and tax exempt etc.
It will be. The US sets security standards for housing for itâ€™s employees traveling abroad, and only 4 and 5 star hotels can meet these standards. In some places of Africa and the Middle East only the most expensive hotels can meet these standards.
I'm just stating the truth its right wing attempt at trying to manipulate "wokeism", with saying now, oh it's the LEFT to blame for not being more acceptingof right wing polotics, corruption, manipulation and abuse of the working class, agressive deportation of asylum seekers, tearing up human rights laws, making old people freeze to death beacuse they support the profits of big companies and the wealthy few over the suffering of the many, Tories taking food out of children's mouths so they can dodge paying tax.. DAMN right I'll bring polotics into it. Enough is enough. You don't have the right to profit off of spreading hatred and ignorance and exploration for your own interests. No! I don't respect that point of view and no genuine human being should.
