As solider-politician Cromwell played an outsized role throughout the history of the Civil War in a way that Fairfax didn't, and if history has to be reduced to a single personification he is probably the best candidate to represent the Roundheads/Parliament. Fairfax was Commander-in-Chief from 1645 until 1649, and Cromwell was his second-in -command; a Lieutenant General, and in charge of the New Model Army's cavalry and scouts. Cromwell's charge and tactical decision at Naseby secured a battlefied victory over Charles' Royal Army, and in 1649 he took over from Fairfax as Commander-in-Chief for the Scottish expedition.
Sorry, I am very ignorant. I was watching Schindler's List where jews were being forced out of poland and someone was shouting "goodbye jews" so I didn't know if that suggested many people in poland viewed them similarly. I know now I am wrong on that.
If you don't mind me asking, can you elaborate on the things you discussed in the first paragraph ("military administration", "strategist", "logistician", etc.)?
Oliver Cromwell is usually remembered as the great general of the English Civil War(s), yet during the first war it was Sir Thomas Fairfax who actually led the New Model Army to victory in its closing months, while Cromwell only commanded its cavalry. Why, then, is Fairfax generally forgotten as a commander compared to Cromwell? Is it just that Cromwell had such a prominent political role later?
