Its not really survival of the fittest anyway but the survival of the most adapt to a certain or multitude of situations. But survival of the fittest rolls nicely from the tounge.
Because russians are now living each in their own little imaginary world, even those who understand this absurd distopian nature of a country, constantly saying "i'm a small man, nothing depends on me, i can't do anything" (I'm like that myself, i hate it but do nothing to fix it) and everyone who could possibly organise them to do something, are either dead, in prison or abroad.
Lol no. It'll take at least 18 years for the 'cannon fodder' to become ripe to be shoved into a cannon. This is for attempting to prevent the catastrophic collapse of the Russian demographics. It's not the economic devastation caused by the sanctions that's fucking Russians for years to come. It's the fact that scarce few youth will be saddled with holding all of the old and infirm on their shoulders. And they're not gonna do that. They're just going to leave, and might return after several decades when the huge swathes of old people have died off so they can actually live in their ancestral homeland without being suffocated and broken by the weight of the numerous old (and the dysfunction of the government and economy and so on).
