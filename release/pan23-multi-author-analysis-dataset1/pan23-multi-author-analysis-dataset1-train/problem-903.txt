If you have a little patience, /u/commiespaceinvader and I did an episode of the AskHistorians Podcast which will be coming out in... late June I think? I forget the schedule, and dives into more of the nitty-gritty of this all.
To your other question, while I'm older and my education was far different than yours in the 1990s - I can't ever remember running into a single non-conspiracy-level theory that 'nobody knew', nor do I remember contemporary general opinion being anything except suicide - one general comment I'd make is that in all sorts of ways the fall of the Soviet Union presented a (sadly) brief stretch in which historians finally had the access to archives to fully verify many of their theories about what had happened behind the Iron Curtain on this and many other subjects. If somehow there were remnants left over from the Stalin campaign still floating around in badly outdated textbooks, whatever justification they had for existing disappeared with that additional resource.
