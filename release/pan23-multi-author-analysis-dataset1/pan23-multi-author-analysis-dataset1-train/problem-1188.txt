1. Has your property tax been paid completely and in full in the appropriate jurisdictions, and in the amount reflected on the numbers provided by the mortgage company?
Given that the property tax rate in any given jurisdiction is pretty easy to look up, this suggests that the error was on the assessed value of your home. If we were to assume that your tax rate is 1% of assessed value (granted this varies by county), this would suggest the miscalculated the value of your home by $400,000.
Thank you! Only real visible "enhancement" has been the removal of a tree and playset the prior owners left, to be replaced with a garden... Though, those are personal preference "enhancements.".
Title: Mortgage conpany "under estimated" property tax by $4,000 last year and monthly payment jumped by $500 starting tomorrow.
3. Were there some sort of shenanigans, up to and including fraud, at closing in which they presented you with a closing package that included intentionally altered numbers for tax in an attempt to sell your the mortgage easier.
I will have to check with the city. I do not believe that my taxes have gone up drastically in the past year.
