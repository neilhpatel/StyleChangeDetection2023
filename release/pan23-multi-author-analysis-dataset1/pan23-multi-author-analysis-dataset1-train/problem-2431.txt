In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yep. I hate everything here. I don’t like fascist Martha Stewart, I don’t like her glorification of the ability to squeeze a trigger or that making an ethical shot is somehow tied to being manly. I also don’t like the articles’ belittlement of people who do like to hunt their food. All parties involved suck.
Hi theindependentonline. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
Discrimination or meritocracy? Was never interested in sports. In employment, I’ve never been at the bottom of any list. Maybe it’s just been her boyfriends that aren’t muscular or gainfully employed?
