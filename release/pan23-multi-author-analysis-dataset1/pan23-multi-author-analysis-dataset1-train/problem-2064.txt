The medieval laws refer to the legal classification of "hermaphroditus", which specifically meant intersex people, but it was sometimes used as an umbrella term for anyone whose sex or gender was ambiguous. The laws on the books at the time were vague, and stated that people should be categorised according to what "is most prominent" in that individual. But does that mean their body and genitalia, the social performance of gender, or their identity, or some combination? No idea. It probably meant their body/genitalia, and we know from one case in Germany that it could work that way, but there's a lot of room for interpretation. We know that the idea of personality and identity mattering more than physical attributes was around, and the idea of gender as a socially constructed performance had been around since the 12th century, but as far as we know there are no records of this issue ever coming up in a medieval English court.
But! We do know that Ida was traveling with her mother and three siblings- NOT her father, who was already in the US awaiting their arrival. We could guess that Mrs. LaRoche may have used the word "mother", but she instead says that she saw "a family"- which insinuates (at least to my eyes and ears) that she's seeing two parents and four children.
