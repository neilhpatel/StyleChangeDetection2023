Not going to lie when I read the title I was so confused since I thought it meant Germany restricted "exporting brazilian tanks to Ukraine" because Brazil didn't allow it and I thought "so? Why is this news?" But after reading now I get it.
Brazil relies on agriculture for 1/3 of it's gdp and has far less buying power in international trade, has much less fertile land due to its soil composition, and we are in the middle of an international fertilizer shortage with potentially devastating shortfalls in food production looming if fertilizer supply is interrupted.
Sure they did. God knows many uninvolved countries still haven't shut up about it. The difference is power. Any country can bitch and threaten, only some countries are able to back it up. Like it or not, that's the way the world works....
Exactly. This neutrality and hesitance to cut ties with Russia is not even Lula's policy, this is Brazil's policy. Any other Brazilian president, be they Left Wing or Right Wing or whatever, would follow a similar line to Lula's on this issue.
