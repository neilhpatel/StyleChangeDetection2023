You are not entirely bound on secondary sources, but they can help you find what you need. Because figures given there are (properly) based on a (or multiple) primary sources. The thing is most of them are in archives (or in museums), and not always digitally accessible. It also depends on what kind of primary source you are looking for. In the case of VOC you could use this .
A professional historian, at least in his/her field of study, should have a more or less good idea about which sources exist, which are available in print editions, which only as original documents in archives all over the place, which of these are recorded in full-text searchable databases, which of these databases are open-access, which of these actually provide the source scanned in digitally (and, if closed access, for how much) and so on...
How did I found this? Well the Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie is Dutch. I found a website that tells a lot about the company, but also indicates website you could visit for further research or books to read on the topic.
