What kind of "fallout" could there possibly be? See my updated EDIT, the law clearly states that a person cannot be held liable or be held to have perjured themselves when denying a sealed or expunged charge in this situation.
(c) Subject to the exceptions in paragraph (b), a person who has been granted an expunction under this section, former s. , former s. , or former s.  may not be held under any provision of law of this state to commit perjury or to be otherwise liable for giving a false statement by reason of such person’s failure to recite or acknowledge an expunged criminal history record.
(b) The person who is the subject of a criminal history record that is expunged under this section or under other provisions of law, including former ss. 893.14, 901.33, and 943.058, may lawfully deny or fail to acknowledge the arrests covered by the expunged record, except when the subject of the record: [FOLLOWED BY LIST OF EXCEPTIONS INCLUDING "DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL" BUT NOT INCLUDING "DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL TRIAL"].
I don't know. but are you willing to risk it when you have a free resource available that you had already paid for?
