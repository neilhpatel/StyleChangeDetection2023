Carlin isnt trying to avoid anything he is being upfront about his knowledge. He usually makes the comment that he isnt a historian when discussing motives for something that are his opinion because he isnt looking at source material, he is relying on the work of academic historians whom he does cite, and often. Carlin isnt trying to create new knowledge, he is giving a history lesson on what is already out there in a narrative format. Its what historians condescendingly call "accessible".
3. Lastly, and to my mind the best option: are you creating historical knowledge? That is, are you producing history (written or otherwise) than adds to our collective understanding of the past? Most typically, this would involve ferreting around in archives and making new discoveries, but might just as well involve reassessing or applying new methods to existing narratives. This to my mind excludes someone like Carlin or the numerous history 'buffs' who read and learn a lot about particular subjects, and often know a great deal about them, but aren't creating new knowledge in doing so. While they may communicate knowledge effectively, they are reliant on others - historians - for that knowledge in the first place. We're hardly talking about a fixed state of being though - the advantage of this kind of categorisation is that it is entirely flexible, offering just about anyone with the knowledge and desire to contribute to our understanding of history to be a 'historian'.
