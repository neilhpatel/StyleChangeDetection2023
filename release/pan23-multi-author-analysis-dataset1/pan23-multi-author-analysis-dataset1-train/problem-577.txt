I think at this point, he's a liability even by GOP standards, and I think even he's beginning to realize that sticking around is probably going to do him more harm than good. This is probably his way of "compromising"; he's hoping that by stepping down from committees, there will be less of a spotlight on him and therefore less scrutiny, which he hoped would allow the whole thing to blow over. Once he fully accepts that this is not going to go away, I think he'll step down and focus on how the fuck to get back to Brazil where being found guilty of a 10 year old case of check fraud is probably going to be easier for him to deal with than the laundry list of crimes he committed in the US.
Nothing has happened YET. Being defeatist won't put Trump behind bars - nor will it rid the other cockroach from office.
Probably. Recent reporting has shown that he hasn't even been in contact with his own district and people there are reaching out to other nearby Congressmen to get things done. Dude's just collecting a paycheck as long as he can before he gets booted the fuck out.
