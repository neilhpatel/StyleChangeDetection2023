Now, the idea that the Khazars - or Khazar elite - converted to Judaism comes from coins minted in rhe 830s and a handful of ontemporaneous accounts that state the conversion happened aroun the 860s. And...that's pretty much it. it. There is no other compelling archeological evidence of which I am aware, and as previously stated, there is no genetic or linguistic evidence to support the idea. But lets look at what we do have.
What also needs to be emphasised is that attempts to downplay the comparatively irrefutable evidence of Judaism amongst the Khazars has partly been a reaction to the reaction to the antisemitic Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry. It must also be pointed out that the prominent historians who have outright rejected the evidence of Khazar Judaism have been heavily influenced by ethno-nationalist ideology.
"Difficull. Problematic lack of evidence is consesus in Russia and Ukraine but 75% say probably, 25% say no. 100% I think conversion happene, but no mass adoption. In addition, look to Khazaria mission of St. Cyrul.
The heart of Khazaria was the Pontic steppe. It was, essentially, a place most travellers and traders passed through, on the way to somewhere else. It was betwixt and between. There are so many different peoples coming and going, telative to the size of the settled population, that the tools we use in Afrrica to examine genetic and linguostic patterns is not very helpful.
