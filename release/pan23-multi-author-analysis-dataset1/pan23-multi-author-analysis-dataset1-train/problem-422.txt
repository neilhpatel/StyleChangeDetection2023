don't forget the GOP leaders in Ohio also ignored multiple orders to fix the gerrymandered maps all last summer (what this article is about). they just thumbed their noses at the court, and finally after no contempt proceedings a friendly judge told them that if they couldn't fix the map by a certain date, they can just go with the one they drew. so "oh well it's too late, better go with the illegal maps!" has lead to a literal invalid stolen election in Ohio. I'm not being dramatic here, the maps are against the Ohio constitution but they had a mid term anyway. Nobody is in jail for this.
I am imagining that any Republican who thought the Jan 6 commissions subpoenas should be resisted will suddenly believe that a subpoena from a Republican-led House commission is like a commandment from God and ignoring one deserves prison time.
Ps. we're also supposed to believe only a few people knew about the nuclear plant bribery scandal in Ohio too.
