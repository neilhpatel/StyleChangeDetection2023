So roughly 95 percent of what I know about Egyptology comes from the Amelia Peabody books (the other five percent probably from what you have written on AH)... Was Maspero really the incompetent cad that he is made out to be in the books? Petrie seems to be just about the only real name in there who gets any unadulterated praise within the context of the time - my impression is that Emerson is basically modeled to be super-Petrie, and a lot of folks in there get just crucified for shoddy methodology and stodgy academic conservatism, but Maspero definitely seems to stand out in my mind.
There are a couple of different reasons for this. For one, it's not unusual for scholars from one or more countries to have dominated the study of a particular ancient state. Most of the key publications on ancient Syria are in French, for example, since many of the major sites (e.g. Ugarit, Qatna, and Mari) were excavated by French teams. The same holds true for Iran, where French teams have long excavated important ancient sites like Susa. In Turkey, German teams have been digging at key sites like Ḫattuša/Boğazköy for over 100 years, and it is impossible to write on the Hittites without delving into German publications.
