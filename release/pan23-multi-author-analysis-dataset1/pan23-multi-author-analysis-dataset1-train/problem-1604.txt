Hi OP. I'm not your attorney and your best course of action is always to seek legal advice from an attorney licensed in your state. That said, here are some Michigan-specific resources you might not otherwise be aware of:
(1) This is a summary of important aspects of Michigan's contract law. Especially relevant to your case is the section on the state's statute of frauds, which explains the general rule that the terms of a written contract will govern, and that oral evidence is generally not admissible to change/add to the unambiguous terms of a written contract. It also cites to, among other things, case law about the conditions under which oral modifications can be made to written agreements.
Understandable. However, I guess the appropriate position to take would be that we are disputing that these wheels were his with his purchase. We were willing to part with them freely when the car was taken, but since this did not occur, our position is that the wheels remained as our property. As is, they are not included on the bill of sales, no extra money was given for them specifically, and aside from a conversation or two that he was interested before a month of radio silence, no effort was made to acquire them after the fact. What legal ground would he have to win this in a small claims court?
