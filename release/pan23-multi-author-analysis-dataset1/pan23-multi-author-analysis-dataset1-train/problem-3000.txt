So if you are interested in looking for buried artifacts or participating in excavations, that would be something to ask archeologists. If you want to know what historians do “9 to 5” so to speak. That really depends on what kind of historian.
Archaeologist here. In Europe, archaeology is considered a subdiscipline of history, but in the US it's considered a subdiscipline of anthropology. It doesn't make a lot of difference.
The second option is to obtain funding from an organization, of which there are a couple at International, European, national, or private levels, which all provide funding for fixed-lenh research projects (usually three or four years). This means that part of the job of being a professional historian who wants to do research is to write up research proposals to obtain this kind of funding in the hopes of being more convincing that what you want to do is more "important" than most others - because way more people want money than there is available for spending. This is especially true for historians and other "philosophical" disciplines, because the natural sciences get...yeah, a bigger piece of the cake.
