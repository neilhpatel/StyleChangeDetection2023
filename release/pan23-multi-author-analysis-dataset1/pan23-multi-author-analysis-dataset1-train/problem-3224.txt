This, and the fact he views all the old Soviet/Tzarist territories as “rightfully” Russia’s. The West stopping him from grabbing Ukraine is seen as a direct attack on Russia because, according to him, Ukraine has no independent culture or history worth respecting. It’s similar to how China views Taiwan. Dude wants to be a new Peter the Great and is mortified at the possibility of failure. His legacy, worldview, AND life are all on the line. I don’t have an ounce sympathy for the bastard.
I mean, if California succeeded from the US in an economic collapse, it’s pretty plausible to believe that Americans would still consider it to be an “American” territory, vassal, or rebellious state. If several states broke apart from the US, there would be a strong following of people who believe the US deserves to reclaim and reunite and that should be a political goal. Now imagine if Russia started arming these breakaway states.
Exactly. It's why they are forming their own army's. They are prepping a force to take over. Russia is going to be an uuuuugly place to be by the end of the year.
