If you talk to a “police officer” ask for their name, badge number, phone number, and police department they work for. Then call the police department during business hours and explain you are returning a call from Officer Smith, badge number xyz. Either they will say “who?” Or they will say okay and take your number, and you will later get a phone call from an Officer Smith who is clearly not the person you talked to earlier (depending on the amount of time and effort the scammers put into the illusion.) Anytime anyone from an “agency” or official business calls you, you should immediately get their name and contact info and call them back utilizing a known, trusted contact for that business before you give them any information.
Don't worry, it's not. If it was, they could contact PayPal and have the transaction reversed. If PayPal didn't cooperate, they could call their bank and have the bank draft / credit card charge voided.
If the transaction was a mistake (it wasn't, it's a scam), PayPal will reverse / void any transactions as needed.
If the transaction is part of a scam / fraud (it is), PayPal will reverse / void any transactions as needed, and flag / lock any accounts as appropriate.
