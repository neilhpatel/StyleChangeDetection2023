So I'm gonna give you a reading list. But before I do, I must say: we do not enjoy any "special treatment" under American law. The rights we exercise are a result of hundreds of years of bloodshed and oppression. American Indians have secured our rights through treaties with the United States, treaties that have preserved our inherent sovereignty as nations. The United States has an obligation to us because they entered into a legally binding contract that constitutes the supreme law of the land and this case in Oklahoma is a result of the United States being held accountable for treaties they violated time and time again. We fought for these rights--it isn't "special treatment.".
So far there is no special treatment, and the Meriam Report 1928 showcases this further, it painted a bleak picture of the impact of assimilation, condemned the Dawes Act and described the terrible conditions many lived in and stating they were the most impoverished people in the USA.
Read through your other posts here! Really interesting stuff, I as a European, feel even honoured to have learnt all this. Do you have a reading list or something you can recommend on the subject? It's all so very much fascinating. They, (we as a swede), had s big recent case about raindear hearing etc that the "villages" (direct translation) won in the highest court here in Sweden so they could keep the pasture. So it's a thing in norden Europe too so to speak. The Sami people in Sweden have their own parliament and stuff. This post was mainly s way for me to draw parallels. I'm not sure there are any. But it is interesting.
Indian Claims Commission 1946 attempted to undo some of the damage that had been done, But, it was slow and disregarded much evidence and only used financial compensation, not the returning of any land. It was planned for 5 years but lasted till 1978 due to the overwhelmning amount of cases filed.
