We first start seeing the makings of political parties immediately after the convention ends. By the end of 1788, staunch supporters of the US Constitution were known as Federalists and those who opposed it were anti-Federalists. Again, these weren’t official parties, at least not yet. It won’t be until into Washinon’s administration that we see our first two formal political parties, including the now evolved form of Federalists and the newly established Democratic Republicans who tended to be made up of pro slavery states and prioritized “states rights” over a stronger national government. The first national election where political parties became the focal point was the election of 1796, which saw John Adams (Federalist) prevail over Jefferson by an electoral college vote of 71 to 68. This was extremely different than George Washinon’s previous two victories where he ran without a political party affiliation and had both Federalists and Democratic Republicans in his cabinet.
I just want to add a couple things. There was no federal justice system at the time. All law was done in the states and people didn't think there would be a big federal justice system. The Constitution created the federal system and no laws had been passed aside from the Constitution. So, other than some areas laid out in Art I, there was just the barest of an inkling of what a federal justice system would entail. Most of what we think of as the federal justice system now is developed through commerce clause powers after the 1937 and the "switch in time that saved nine.".
