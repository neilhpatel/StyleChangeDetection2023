In the case of getting your car impounded I guess you can consider that paying for the cost of making sure your car isn't stolen along with the wheels and engine and stuff like that but in a school setting it's different as at least in my school that is you can have your phone taken to the office for as little as checking the time because your teacher didn't have a clock in the classroom or refused to tell the student the time And in the way that impounding can technically be charging for the care of the car taking a student's phone enforcing them to pay the fine is different as they're not finding you for the care of your phone they're finding you just to get the phone back in general and in some cases they might even go through the phone depending on where you are at least from what I've heard same goes for other electronics And even if there isn't supposed to be a clock watching in schools students still do it because there's not a lot of things that you can do when school after your work is done at least the most classes from what I've heard and this makes it hard to do anything to keep your mind off of stuff And at least where I live your phone can be taken up for as little checking the time or even The ringer going off during class can get it taken up (My school has not seen not heard not taking policy).
