For example, a part of a research paper I wrote involved the biography of a Southern Cotton Mill owner in the late 1890s, written by his children in the early 1900s. A huge portion of that biography dealt with that guy's lineage, who his grandparents were, they used terms like "of the finest Anglo-Saxon stock" to describe his ancestors who were on the Mayflower. If my interest was purely in learning about this guy's life, I may just take away that he was born in New England and migrated to the South at one point or another, and I might care that his Great-Grandfather was a Puritan, but that's not necessarily super relevant to my purposes. If I were a social or cultural historian, I'd have more interest in that terminology. Did he feel the need to justify his ancestry to the Southern elite because they cared about that type of thing? How similar is this obsession with "lineage" to the way that the European aristocracy viewed themselves and their claims to power? That type of thing. In the case of the aforementioned General's memoirs, if he was wrong in his recollections, that could still be a relevant primary source to talk about the fact that that general was wrong, or maybe he said something about the way his unit was made up, and thus those memoirs could be relevant for analyzing the unit's order of battle.
One last thing. The importance of some types of historical records depends on the period studied. For example, coins are pretty important for older periods, but are not really important for the XX century for example. This is the same for religious texts or legends. They are not used by those who study contemporary or late modern periods. The same for human remains, which are seldom used for XIX-XX century.
