The podcast [hashtag]sistersinlaw just talked about the change in rhetoric from targeting providers to targeting pregnant people. They point out that abortion pills can be provided through mail, and the vast amount of abortions these days are conducted via medication. They plan(ed?) to use a law about exposing children to harmful chemicals that was created to punish people creating meth labs to arrest people having an abortion using pills. That law has a 99 year max sentence.

Don't be rude. We all know what they meant. Grammatical errors only count in language classes and on publications you sell to others. This is Reddit.
