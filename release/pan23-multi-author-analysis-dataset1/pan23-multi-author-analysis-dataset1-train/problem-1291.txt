This is completely legal. If they didn't want to spend the money to make the repairs, they are not obligated to, regardless of whether or not you've already paid. They (and you) have two options: they can either void the sale and refund your money (which it appears is what they are going with), or you accept the car with all of it's potential problems, understanding that they have disclosed everything and are obligated to pay for none. They are most likely choosing the first option because if they were to sell you a crappy car, then it would look bad on them as well.
The only thing I have questions about is, this car supposedly has all of these issues that they're not willing to fix, but they're already trying to sell it again? sketchy.
Otherwise the dealership has usually up to 30 days to refund your down payment, but I would reach out and ask about the timeframe as well as discuss the potential to continue with the purchase under new terms.
1. "Car needed to go through their safety inspection prior to me getting the keys. During the inspection, they found repairs that need to be made. Received a call on 11/29/21 that they weren’t going to pay for the repairs as it’s too expensive and they are voiding the contract. ".
My guess is that they offer "safety inspected" vehicles and "[no representations about inspection]" vehicles, and that they've returned the vehicle to the lot with a lesser advertisement or sales agreement ready. Think of it as a low-end version of "Certified Pre-Owned" ads, with their long list of things they promise to give a cursory look.
