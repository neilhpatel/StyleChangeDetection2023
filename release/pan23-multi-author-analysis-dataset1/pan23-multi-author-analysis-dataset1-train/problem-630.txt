In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. It's obvious and incontrovertible. I still say it's a mistake to strictly let Republicans off the hook though, as they're in virtual lockstep against everything good and decent in the world, but it must be acknowledged that Democrats as a party were 100% on the side of corporations in this fight.
How do we know that? Biden didn't include the 7 day sick leave provision in his initial deal, nor did he support the amendment. What makes you think otherwise?
That’s leverage in negotiations. Democrats took it upon themselves to screw the Unions and remove that leverage. They could’ve just let the process play out like it’s supposed to, but they chose to put their thumb on the scale for their big campaign contributors railroad industry.
