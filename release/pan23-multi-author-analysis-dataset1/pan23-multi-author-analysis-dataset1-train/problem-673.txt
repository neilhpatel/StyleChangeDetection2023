Oh ffs. You can support Ukraine and still question the wisdom of taking a trip into a war zone that our military isn't directly involved in. I'm all for supporting Ukraine but I have a few problems, such as what does the ending of this whole thing look like? We're dumping billions into this conflict but the end criteria is apparently "well Zelenskyy will net us know when it's over". Russia doesn't want to talk because they got their offensive kicking off and want to see how things look after that is finished. Then right behind it you got an offensive that Ukraine's planning late spring so they don't want to talk either. And my money's on that when we get to fall they're going to be in basically the exact same place they are now minus a couple of hundred thousand+ dead on each side.
Insurrections. "National Divorces". Many calls for secession. Lionizing fascism and autocracy. Openly supporting Russia and North Korea. The GOP have made it crystal clear that they are enemies of the United States.

Yeah, Tucker Carlson is a rootin' tootin' shootin'-off-his-mouth-for-Putin, dog-scootin'-its-butt-on-the-carpet ain't-no-Einstein-or-Isaac-Newton hoot of a guy.
That's the far right. Towards the center there's concern about what the end goal is supposed to look like. You got the west saying "we're not at war with Russia" but at the same time you have Zelenskyy saying "victory or death" We're getting close to 100 billion in aid for Ukraine and nobody has an answer as to what's an acceptable ending to these hostilities.
