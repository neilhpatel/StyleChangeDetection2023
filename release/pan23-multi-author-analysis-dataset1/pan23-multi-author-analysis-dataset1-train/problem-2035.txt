Wow what a revelation! Trumpy got impeached over holding funds to Ukraine for a political favour that Zelensky didn’t fall for. He made the situation worse for Ukraine by weakening it and made Putin stronger. Where has Trump being the last year, this observation is hardly new or perceptive, Biden and the EU are trying not to start WWIII. His famous words are that Putin is his friend and will trust him, he knows how Putin thinks and he will end this war, when we know Trump will give away Ukraine to Putin for free because he thinks Putin is a genius. Remember how stupidly Trump wanted the US to be pulled out of NATO because it saves money for the US, so he can take that money and steal it from the US and put it in his pockets. Trump can’t be trusted with anything, he spread the BIG LIE because he wanted to win at all cost, he wanted Mike Pence killed if he would not over turn the electoral college results, a despicable human being. How many crimes has Trumpy committed on 1/6 insurrection and the DOJ hasn’t laid a finger on him yet. How about the intentional stealing of classified and top secret documents from the government. How come he boxed all those documents and dropped them at his Florida home, were they up for sale, how much of those documents did Trumpy sell to governments. It never ends well with Trumpy, because with Trumpy it’s me, myself and I regardless of country.
