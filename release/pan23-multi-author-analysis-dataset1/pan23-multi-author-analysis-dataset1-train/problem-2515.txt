Facts. A guy fucking immolated himself on the steps of the capital in protest to this shit, and no one heard a single word about it. But some teens throw soup at a painting? You best bet that’s got people talking.
Evidence for lowered fertility rates points directly to pollution, especially from plastics which are all are derived from petroleum hydrocarbons.
What the hell are you talking about? Unless you’re talking about a different guy who immolated himself on the steps of the Supreme Court, the guy I’m talking about (Wynn Bruce) was an avid climate activist and was described by most who knew him as incredibly invested in climate issues. It is stupid to think that someone who immolated himself, on Earth day, who was known to be an extreme climate activist, in a time where the Supreme Court was making incredibly impactful climate decisions, and who was also Buddhist and previously posted pictures of Buddhist monks that immolated themselves in protest, just decided to light himself on fire just because. Just felt like burning that day I suppose.
