As a Slovene, I can say the same. Our dumb prime minister said a while ago that the Western Balkans are on Russia's side. Our dumb foreign minister said there can be no peace or stability in Europe without Russia. We're still waiting for comments from our dumb Karen of a president. It's a shitshow, led by sympathizers of the old communist regime.
Its interesting that you reference annexations in the balkans - he specifically referenced the international annexation of serbian territory to create kosovo as a comparison to the situation in ukraine.
No. I dont think his former party supports him anymore. He did quite a turn to the rifght in last years. His function is mostly ceremonial so he uses it to just say anything and be "the guy who says it how it is". Anytime he has a speech or talks with the press, people are cringing in advance.
Interesting. I am rather surprised that’s the case. I’m in a discord with a bunch of Slovenes, they never talk about domestic politics. American politics though… Like they post stories from L.A. It’s weird. I am thinking about trying to learn some basic Slovenian actually.
