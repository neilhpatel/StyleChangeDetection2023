Johnson's support of the Civil Rights movement and his war on poverty had really harmed his constituency in the South, which had been known as the "Solid South" for generations due to its tendency to vote Democrat almost every presidential election. In the 1964 election, for the first time in generation, the Democrats won without the support of the South, which had gone to Republican Barry Goldwater. Previously a party that more or less ignored civil rights, the Republican Party instead used Johnson's support of civil rights against him in order to grab the support of these Southerners. This is called the "Southern Strategy" as embracing pro-segregation policy was seen as a ploy to win Southern votes for a party that had more or less never done well in the region.
No offense meant! I generally agree with everything you've said about Nixon's legacy. I was just trying to tongue-in-cheek point out the issue I saw here - in a comment chain nominally about Erlichman's motivations, your perspective is presented yet Erlichman's name doesn't even appear.
