The PPP loans were poorly managed, not very well thought out, and hurried. They helped, but it was easy for business owners to use the proceeds to cushion balance sheets. We received one and kept everyone onboard. That said, it was fairly easy to do something that was not "in the spirit" of the program. They could have easily not paid you for 2 weeks or a month and then paid you after lockdown and claimed that the money paid at any point thereafter came from the loan. As long as they paid out payroll expenses that met or exceeded 100% in that calendar year and kept everyone on that wanted to, then it probably is legal and no fraud was committed. If you think they committed fraud then I'm sure you could report them somewhere easily enough.
Am important consideration. PPP loans equalled two months payroll cost and had to be used 60% or 75% to cover payroll expense over 24 weeks. it was very easy to use the ppp loan in 24 weeks and still not be able to have all employees on payroll. I'm wondering how employer managed to prevent them from getting unemployment. Even people who quit their jobs were getting it with no hurdles.
