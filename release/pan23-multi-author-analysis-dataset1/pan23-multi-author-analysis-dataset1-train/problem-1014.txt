As you note, Herodotos is reasonably even-handed, but some of his accounts are clearly biased - the one that occurs to me is the assertion that the aged Spartiates at Thermopylai were supposedly running circles around the royal guard of the Persians in terms of skilfulness. In.
I suppose I should have been clearer that the sympathetic element is there only insofar as one is supposed to recognise the individuals as humans with human flaws, and that in a sense a living foreign king could be as useful as a mythic Greek, both of whom would in one way or another be far removed from a contemporary audience.
Thanks! I do think modern readings of Greek authors on Persia tend to read them as more unsympathetic than was probably intended. It has occurred to me that a lot of these Greek authors, including Xenophon and Herodotos, were translated into Latin only in the mid-15th century, at the point were the Ottomans were ascendant, and it's hard to not think that confluence influenced readings of "the East" in ancient works.
