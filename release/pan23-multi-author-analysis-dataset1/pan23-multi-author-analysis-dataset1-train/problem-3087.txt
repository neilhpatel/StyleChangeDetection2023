So if I believe my landlord is violating my lease, my only recourse is to accept the fine from her and then sue her? There isn't even an agency I can contact that would inform her that what she is doing violates the lease?
But how can I go about making sure that the fines are not authorized by the lease? None of the residents are lawyers but by our reading of the lease, we haven't seen anything that gives her the power to add new fines. I don't want to get into a situation where we tell her we won't be paying the fines only to find out they were allowed by the lease.
All I'm saying is that fines are not in the lease and jumping straight to eviction as an alternative, since that is in the lease, if we fight the fine could constitute harassment.
The reason for this view would be that escalating a dirty dish to an eviction would be unreasonable and lead to loss in quality of life, tenant harassment, or whatever the legal term is. I want to show that the lease says nothing about additional fines, and if she were to threaten eviction over dirty dishes instead of fines, it could constitute harassment. That's the angle I'm using.
That's interesting. Multi-tenant, shared space, tenancy is also interesting. You'd have to check your lease carefully.
