It's not a perfect system. It's not even a good system. But it's the system we have and pouting about it isn't going to change that. You will never get election reform that allows for meaningful third parties, or protections for voting rights, or even assurances that your vote will actually count (following Moore v. Harper closely) by voting for republicans.
If you're a reasonable conservative you should vote for Democrats because republicans no longer represent you. If republicans lose enough, they'll eventually learn that to remain relevant they will have to start representing moderate conservatives and not just the lunatics who want a fascist christian theocracy. The alternative is they become less and less relevant over a few cycles (assuming that their election subversion attempts fail) to the point where the party fractures and maybe you get a reasonable conservative party again. Or you could pray that Trump destroys DeSantis then gets indicted and sent to jail shortly before the primary, opening the door for an actual reasonable choice. But that's a fairly long shot.
