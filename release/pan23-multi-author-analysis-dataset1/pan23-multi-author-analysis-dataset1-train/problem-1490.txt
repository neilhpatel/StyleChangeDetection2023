It seems to leave room for the employer to say, “having another full time job means you can’t dedicate yourself to this one In the capacity we need, therefore we are going to end the working relationship with you. “.
Current Contract says: "During the term of the employment, I will not engage in any other employment activity directly related to the business in which is the company is now involoved, nor I will engage in any other activities that conflict with my obligations to the company.".
Outside of some specific areas/states, "I'm firing you for merely having another job, even though it doesn't conflict with your job here at all," is a perfectly valid and legal reason to terminate an at-will employee's employment.
And even if he hasn't explicitly agreed to not do this, again, in most areas of the USA, one or both of his employers finding out could end in his termination from one or both of his jobs.
That agreement, in and of itself, doesn’t seem to explicitly bar him from other employment, but depending on what the other employment entails, might.
