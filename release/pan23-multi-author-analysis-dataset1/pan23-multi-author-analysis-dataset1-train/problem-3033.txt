>What came after World War II, for many reasons, including - and I talk about this in the book - that in 1942, partly in response to fears of Japanese propaganda, President Roosevelt ordered that the Department of Justice, for the first time, take seriously the reality that slaves were still being held in the South. And the Department of Justice mounted a serious criminal prosecution against a family in Texas for holding a man named Alfred Irving(ph) as a slave for many years, and that the father and the daughter and that family were convicted and sent into prison. That was the first serious effort, for 50 years really, to prosecute someone for holding slaves and that was the beginning of the end of this massive system but it certainly the case that there were incidents - terrible incidents like the one the caller describes, they continued for many decades after that.
Now do 'Nest Lay' or 'Mundus Delez'. Deplorable behavior by the convicted in this case for sure, but this is nano-scale potatoes compared to the real modern slavers.
