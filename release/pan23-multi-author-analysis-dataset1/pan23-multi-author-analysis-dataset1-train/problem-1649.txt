Regardless of any of the questionable points you raise, Russia is not going back to the status quo that was achieved post 1990. Trade, sanctions and dependence on russia's natural resources are not going to revert to pre war. The deep economic ties in Europe with Russia will not be restored. They are at an even harsher reality than where they were during the peak of cold war. Europe finally came to the realization that their security is affected by economic ties to a murderous clepto-authoritarian country.
Or what? Your military can't even handle the Ukraine, a country 1/16th the size of the U.S. (and 1/7th of its population) that you even share a border with. You're losing tactically, strategically and militarily.
I believe it too. The intelligence that we gave to Zelensky to stay alive? He would never have received it. The intelligence RU would have needed to kill or capture him? Probably in their hands.
Another warning? Oh no... anyway, I hope Ukraine enjoys using those PATRIOT missiles to keep their civilians safe from the literal terrorists and their civilian terror bombings.
