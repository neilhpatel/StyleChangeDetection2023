At this point it is what it is. Putin has been and is an aggressive expansionist and is a threat to a large portion of the globe, he is the bigger focus and until Russia is no longer a threat(which won’t happen under Putin) and can contribute oil or the word moves off of oil repeatedly Maduro probably isn’t going to be a focus. He got really lucky.
Funny how in western media and especially in the States you hear on the news about illegal immigrants and caravans, but not how the while hemisphere is struggling with a massive refugee migration crises (other countries like Guatemala, El Salvador, and Cuba are also sending refugees around, but it pales in comparison to Venezuela).
There is a small chance this does work out. Maduro is a bit of an egotist, Venezuela isn’t in a good state which isn’t great for the leaders either(even if they created and maintain the issue), and legitimacy would strenhen him and his party. There’s a chance(I personally see it as incredibly small) Maduro see’s this as a window to move back towards democracy. The opposition is splintered and the economy could do better by next election, he may consider being more democratic because if he wins in the next election that way he will have a better reputation and stronger rule, it would give him More international legitimacy and allow him to play a world leader(big ego boost), and would improve the economy if international trade opens up. With a divide opposition, the ability to utilize state resources and a growing economy he would have a chance to win fairly next election and he could take it. I’m highly doubtful on him opening up, but that’s what some diplomats seem to be pushing for.
