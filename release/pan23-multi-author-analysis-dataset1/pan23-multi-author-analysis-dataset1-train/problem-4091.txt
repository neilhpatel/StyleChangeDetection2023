I am an attorney based out of South Florida. I am not your attorney and this information is only to educate you on a very specific issue. I do not guarantee anything one way or another. You absolutely should obtain legal counsel to represent you, that would probably set you up for the best possible outcome in your very specific situation. Nothing that I say below is meant to establish an attorney client relationship with you and you should not think I am your attorney or that anything I say here should be repeated in court to a Judge/Prosecutor/Anyone.
Right. Thank you for clearing it up. How can he be charged with a dui? He may have said he was intoxicated and decided not to drive but remained in the driver seat with key in ignition. It doesn’t even need to be on where I’m at for it to constitute a dui.
Location matters. In many jurisdictions, the state doesn't have to prove actual driving, only that you were in 'actual physical control' of the vehicle. What that means can vary by state as well.
