same! i work in a high-hazard industry and we’ve had a handful of openings for over a year. no one can manage to not smoke long enough to pass a urine test, despite the good wages and job stability. i’m pro not taking drugs before being in a highly dangerous environment so response times are great, but i’m also pro not drinking before being in a highly dangerous environment for the same reason. and apparently that’s not as big of a deal to many employers. instead, we’ll just be short-staffed, which isn’t safe either.

Its a completely unnecessary invasion of privacy. The company you work for has literally no need or right to know, or control, what you do off the clock.
