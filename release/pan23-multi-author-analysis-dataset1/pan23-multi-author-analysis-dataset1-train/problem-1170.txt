This regime is so stupid: it’s like they are sitting in a room asking each other “ how can we make this worse & how can we drag this out as long as possible”. Get some proper advisers & stop believing that you are “supreme” over others. Pieces of shit.
If you wanted to know my opinion, I think that foreign countries should put economic and political pressure (not an armed intervention, god not again) on the Iranian government to stop them from massacring people in the street- because so far I, and many analysts, see only a few ways the protests might end:
Did you fill out an application to be born? I guess not. Did we just pop up out of nowhere from nothing, you came to that conclusion after realizing the complexity of the human body and its functions (some which we still don’t know of?).
Well the US propaganda machine is trying it's absolute hardest to do so and literally had to resort to exploiting Masha Amini's death as a "fk you" after the nuclear deal collapsed which by the way Iran was more than happy to resign with the same terms, but Congressional assholes "with their negotiating power didn't like the terms".
I don’t believe that any other gods ever existed or exist. I believe that there is only one god that has always existed and will always exist. One god that has no children, no partners and no comparisons. There is nothing that than can be compared to him and no one can picture him. That one god sent prophets from the first human on earth to the last prophet 1400 years ago. He sent over a 100,000 prophets around the world. Everything else people call god are fabrications and have zero effect on your life. Other religions (specifically majors ones) contain contradictions or fictions.
The situation in Iran is going to be a catastrophe no matter what. I just think that a civil war is not going to happen.
