I'm from northern Finland. I can count on two hands the amount of days when we had -25c or colder temperatures since the new year. Usually around this time of year the temperature is a comfortable -15c to -25c, but this year it has been between 0c and -15c. This winter has been unbearably hot compared to last winter. Recently the temperature has alternated almost daily between 0c and freezing, which means that the top layer of the snow/ice is melting and then freezing into a smooth ice surface. It's fine to drive on in a car, but if you're walking on foot it's really annoying because there's always this one bit of the sidewalk that isn't covered by gravel and that's the part you step on while walking and end up almost slipping on.
Yep. Everything is different now. Older people like myself, seem to notice more than anyone, but they won't accept it. I fucking weep for future generations. It's only going to get worse. No one wants to sacrifice their comfort. Myself included, in a lot of ways.
of the lower troposphere show that globally January temperatures were in fact a little lower than the 30 year running average, though they were definitely higher across much of Eastern Europe.
