If your faith is a faith of one, and the only recognizable tenet is "I don't want to get the vaccine," then a human rights complaint over this is a non-starter. Your options are as the school is presenting them: get vaccinated, or withdraw from class. Mandatory vaccination in educational contexts is long-standing and completely unremarkable legally - we've been doing this in Ontario since polio was a thing.
Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or youâ€™ve edited your post to comply with the rules, . Do not make a second post or comment.
None of the three major branches of Christianity generally referred to that way - Eastern Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, or Coptic Orthodox - have rejection of vaccines as part of their doctrine. Are you part of an unusual sect, or is this a personal interpretation of your church's doctrines?
If you aren't part of an organized religion but have a long-standing and sincerely held personal religious belief, then have a lawyer draft the letter. They'll know how best to frame that against the requirements of Ontario's human rights laws.
