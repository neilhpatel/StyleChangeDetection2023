I work for a Norwegian company that has maritime and military branches. Within the first month of the war, the stock price skyrocketed. Like from 120 NOK to 340 NOK. It was insane. Cruel, but it was really beneficial for those who were in employee stock program. My friend sold most of his stock and payed 3/4 of his mortgage.
Second, while I consider a mistake Germany closing its nuclear and not extending it's life for cheap, let's not forget that expanding nuclear building new plants has been more expensive than wind, solar PV, coal or natural gas for years already (again, France and Finland), so don't lump together costs of keeping nuclear and increasing nuclear shares on energy.
No. We have not used the fund to reduce taxes. That is what Thatcher did in the UK with their oil and gas revenue, to no permanent gain.
In international terms, Norwegian HÃ¸yre government is a leftist social democratic governmrnt. We can start talking about right-oriented government when we have a government coalition of FRP, Demokratene and Alliansen.
