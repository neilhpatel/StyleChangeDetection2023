Not really. You pay for unemployment by working and paying taxes. It's a state benefit given to you because you worked. I would be more worried about someone who didn't draw unemployment than someone who did. Because I would worry that 1) they either did something that disqualified them from unemployment or 2) they're lying about their work history and couldn't qualify for unemployment rather than thinking they just opted to burn through their savings until they got another job.
