How would a team like yours go about investigating the level of Murdoch-owned media outlet coordination happening in uK, Australia and America to push harmful political agendas through the use of disinformation (eg climate change denialism, Brexit disinformation, Jan 6 disinformation)?
Good question. At the moment, we’re working on a lot of Iran stories which are always pretty challenging from an “OSINT” perspective. Internet access over there is severely restricted, which means that the videos shared on social media are limited. There is also very little street-view imagery in Iran, which makes geolocating videos a lot more laborious than it is with other places. On top of that, there is no international media presence there. We often cross-reference our findings with reporting or footage captured by other journalists, so not having that can be tricky. It’s not impossible, but it sure can be difficult.
It’s impossible to know even a small percentage of the tools that are available. Having the right mindset is key – what am I trying to find out? Is it likely a tool exisits? If not, will it help if we use traditional journalism methods to help find the answer – Adam.
