How can inflation of 400-500% be driven by prices buoy up and down? Inflation is an average, and consumer consumption is a large share of the economy, even in Communist countries. Not all of the economy, but if the money supply is fixed in the short term, then to get CPI of 400-500%, the prices of business and capital goods would have to be plummeting, falling by about 400-500%. This seems implausible, a much more likely explanation is that the hyperinflation was caused by an increase in the money supply (or the money was already there and in the past the availability of goods was limited by non-money forms, e.g. rationing.).
When the newly created Russian Federation decided to remove the widespread price controls across literally all consumer goods (part of the Yegor Gaidar-led so-called 'Shock Therapy' reforms which sought to modernize the Russian economy overnight) there was huge pushback-- both from within Russia itself by the citizenry as well as from neighboring nations who largely relied on the Russian economy like Ukraine, Belarus, and others.
Thank you for taking the time to clarify. My comment was promoted by this passage from your first comment:
Definitely! Price controls were not the most serious flaw in the Russian/Soviet economic system-- especially by the nineties.
