I agree with this but we also have to factor in the facts that A. Their ire is directed at specific areas/groups, which is indicative of a larger social movement that is hijacking their lack of support and supplementing it with violence. We all know who and what is causing this on that level B. Society doesn’t offer ANY sufficient antidotes to the real suffering that people go through. This has always been the case but it used to be that there was some sense of solidarity inducing elitism around class, gender, and race - and in the dissolution of those lines, many men have been left feeling slighted by this lack of commonly shared supremacy. So whereas it was just always a reality for other groups, and thus they were taught by parents and peers how to cope, for young men in particular it wasn’t always a reality to them - they were told they could have it all - and this is all compounded by the fact that they also haven’t been given coping mechanisms to the harsh realities of the world due to this societal expectation of “your group experiences smooth sailing = we shouldn’t have to talk about any problems”.
Nailed it. It was really hard for for me to wrap my head around this phenomenon. It’s so bizarre if you’re not a part of it. But it’s real and we have to recognize it and deal with it. Stay safe, hbprof.

Absolutely. Of course starting with the biggest narcissist of them all, trump. But so many others in this cult, as well. Have you heard OathKeeper leader, Rhodes’ testimony at his trial? Unfuckingbelieveable, his narcissism is off the charts.
