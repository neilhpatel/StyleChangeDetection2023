Yes, but the point /u/supercyberlurker made is completely different from yours and yet you ignored it completely: the point is that, unfortunately as the world works, those who wield the greatest militaristic and technological strenh will always have a high probability of defeating the rest of the population – that means you and I and everyone else, no matter how many of us unite together – because, at the end of the day, if you have one massive army that is weak versus one that is extremely powerful, the weak will likely lose in almost all cases.
Government agents beat a woman to death for not wearing a hijab. Protests began. More beatings, more protests. Currently 15,000 Iranians are imprisoned for protesting and the Iranian parliament recently voiced support for executing them all.
The good guys do not win wars. The most powerful do, almost always. Yes, it is highly, highly likely that the Iranian people will lose and their government will win (which I wish were not the case, but this is reality we're talking about, so let's be realistic, not idealistic).
What is this? Article? We were just talking. What you mean ignoring? Are you sick or something? I just said something came to my mind, what is this lecture you giving here, my English is not good enough and I don't have the will to read this just gonna block you, coming out of nowhere attacking me just because i said something obvious to all of us.
