Your friend can complain to the officer’s agency and express his desire to see her prosecuted. He can’t make it happen.
Also, I understand your traffic laws analogy, but - unlike with domestic violence - many states have not enacted mandatory arrest/mandatory citation laws for traffic violations, right?
Right. They are not. Though obviously they wouldn’t use their discretion in that way. Or at least not for long.
I understand that’s unconstitutional, and that VAWA implemented an incentive structure for individual states to enact mandatory arrest laws.
Right, I understand that it would be unconstitutional to do so, but it incentivized states to enact mandatory arrest laws.
So, if the state has implemented such laws, then aren’t individual police departments required to comply with those laws?
If a state requires a DV mandatory arrest, then aren’t police departments required to arrest if there is evidence of DV?
But, on a lower level, haven’t many states enacted mandatory arrest laws? States have the constitutional power to mandate those things, right?
I understand that in a republic like ours, we elect politicians who we believe enact laws that we agree with. But aren’t there certain objective standards?
