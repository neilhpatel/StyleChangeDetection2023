When did it take hold in people's minds? Many authors state that one of the first postapocalyptic fiction pieces was The Last Man by Mary Shelley. If you read its synopsis (as I admit to doing; it's a long, sentimental melodrama as much as anything), it seems that Shelley basically wrote The Walking Dead, World War Z, or any other modern zombie apocalypse story â€” but in 1826. So, a plague sweeps through the world, and nations break down in lurid detail. An apocalyptic cult leader rules Paris from the catacombs; British Lord Protector dies lying on top of heaps of provisions; frenzied American refugees invade Scotland; survivors flee north, where the virus can't thrive; some spend their last months in the Swiss Alps; and the last four .
Thank you for this. Did you research European history only for this or did you go broader? I ask because your examples seem to be focused that way and I wonder if native americans, who seemed to have a massive decline due to disease europeans brought, might have had more 'end of the world' works.
