The licensing would be through the state Public Utilities Commission or similar agency which regulates certain private businesses in the public's best interests. That's how tow companies are allowed to move and impound vehicles without the owner's consent and it's not theft as long as they follow certain rules. Bonding is required by the terms of the license to guarantee recourse if the company violates the law or otherwise behaves in an unethical manner. A way to think about it is that a tow company's license allows them to legally operate a towing, recovery, and impound business, their insurance covers damage they cause in the course of doing business, and the bond covers malicious, illegal, or unethical actions they commit by abusing the privileges granted by the license.
Towing & impound is a business that requires licensing & bonding, there are rules which must be followed, especially when a vehicle is moved without the owner's consent. It's now a police & insurance company matter since that process was not followed and harm was done.
Interesting. My car is an automatic front wheel drive, would that change the damages done? I know for certain he didn't have the proper equipment (dollies) because of the skid marks so I'm wonder if my car would apply to potential transmission damage.
