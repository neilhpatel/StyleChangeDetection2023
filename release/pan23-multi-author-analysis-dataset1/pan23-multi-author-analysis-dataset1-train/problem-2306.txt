Republicans should have won WAY more of those races than they did. Historically the party that holds the White House during their first midterm gets trounced by the opposition party in those elections. There should have been a red wave, and it wasn't anything even approaching that. No offense but the only people who think that the midterms were awful for Democrats are people who don't really understand electoral politics. Political analysts were talking about how awful the midterms were for Republicans not Democrats. The only reason Republicans were able to take the house, barely, is because of gerrymandering. Democratic turnout will be high in a presidential election, especially when there is an incumbent in office, and a despised candidate like Trump on the other side.
That's fine. Why are you here commenting on politics at all then? If you don't care, aren't going to vote, don't want to have a substantive conversation about policy? It doesn't make much sense really.

What happened, "Senate Republicans"? Did your balls drop off? What would you need to step up and stop this guy... some sort of power and influence? Maybe a high national office of some sort? ðŸ™„.
