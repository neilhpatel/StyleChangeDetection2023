Ukraine can and will be rebuild. This speculation while have rational grain in it, will be as precise as "russians capture Kyiv in 3 days and we can't do anything about it" Human power is the key. Ukrianians will emerge united and stinger from this conflict. The west really need to speed up military support. It will save a lot of lifes and money.
The US financed the rebuilding of vastly more deteriorated economies of Japan & Europe at a loss to protect the integrity of democratic institutions against Communism and its totalitarian regimes.
These 8 million refugees will, most likely, not go back. And investments into rebuilding will be literal cabal contracts with draconian conditions (because the higher the risk, the more money will the investor demand back).
Nope. Hopefully, the rebuild will attract the very best. I'm sure funds will be available, as will be planners, architects and artists. There will be an opportunity to renew and redeem against the appalling loss of lives, and community. My heart goes out to all those who have lost so much in this unjustified war ðŸ˜¢.
Creative destruction is in full effect - physically and ideologically. Hope and trust over doom and gloom.
