Well. That’s all good, sometimes letters like that are boilerplates where it’s just automatically sent from that person. Hard to tell really. But I would still request to speak with that director to find out what happened and why your side of the story wasn’t taken seriously. And if the school is willing to risk litigation if that’s their prerogative. Ask them who was involved with the investigation that could have supported your side of the story. If you have claims about the girl lying, and proof that she does bring that up also. You have to stand up for yourself sometimes and it seems like you’re not willing to do that. No one else will do it for you.
Was kicked out of school because of my timelines not corresponding and have no way to track my movements throughout the night, I personally know what she claims happened I would never do but I have 0 proof otherwise and I’m just moving on from the whole situation. All things considered the way they let me go was super shady, was told no charges were being pressed and that there was nothing going on my transcript as to why I left.
