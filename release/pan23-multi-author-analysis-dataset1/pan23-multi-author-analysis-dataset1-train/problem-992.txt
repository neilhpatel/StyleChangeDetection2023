The roommates could sue you for what you would have needed to pay until July. That's how it basically always works.

“Right of replacement option and financial liability if one/any tenants is in breach or terminates lease early: If one of the 4 tenants that moved in as a group on 7/1/2021 has financial obligation that has not been cured, the remaining tenants have the right to 1. Identify a similar occupant to take place of the one who has/will move out thus insuring there is no loss of rents to owner. The occupant must be approve by owner and go through similar move in process. 2. If there is no replacement occupant identified and there is a financial loss to the owner, the remaining occupants do hereby agree to make up difference until another occupant has been identified and funs their lease”.
