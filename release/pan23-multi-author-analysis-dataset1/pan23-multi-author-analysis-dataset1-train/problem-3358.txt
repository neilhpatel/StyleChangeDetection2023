Republicans appeal to the ignorance of their voters, enabling their worst impulses, indulging their fears, phobias and paranoid delusions, their chauvinistic and entitled attitudes with alarmist rhetoric and propaganda that paints a picture of a country under attack, a country corrupted by a left wing monster whose talons tightly grip the deep flesh and sinews of our American government and institutions. This in turn grants Republicans all the justification they need to move forward with their suppressive, discriminatory, counter-revolutionary agenda. It's taken right from the fascist playbook.
I think the Republican party has kind of given up on having rational adult conversation about issues because many of their positions just can't be suggested as being good for their voters (like cutting access to public retirement funds that people have spent their entire working lives paying into). Because of this, they're now tied to trying to score votes with their base by flinging mud. This is the result. They act and sound like deranged, angry, crazy people.
