Could be an ideal time to invest the money made from profit to become less dependant on oil energetically. So when price rise up again, they wouldn't even see the difference.
Involved Economically and Via trade, not involved Militarily. Our military is to defend our own borders , well aware that no one else can help us in when the need arrives. Only Russia has helped India militarily In Past conflicts, US and EU mainly stood with Pakistan openly supplying them weapons and money and training.
Easy there. I'm not on a high horse. There's a huge difference. I want to know exactly what companies are doing it. Or if it's a city utility or public service that's doing it. Because that's the difference between private funds and state funds being spent. Which could completely change the optics. There's no info in the article.
Indians don't majoritarily agree with the invasion as we ourselves had experiences with territorial losses from invasions but we are more concerned about uplifting india to a more develoed nation rather than pander to west vs rus conflicts.
