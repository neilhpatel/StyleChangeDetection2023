I’m sure you know by now that even if you both are adults, and even if what he did wasn’t classified as sexual assault, it is a HUGE HR issue for a supervisor to make passes at an employee as it can be considered abuse of power. Even if you decided you wanted a relationship one or both of you could lose your job for that. But given how scared you are I wouldn’t even bother trying to keep this job, I’d no call no show. I get that finding work in a pandemic is hard, but you’re young, and also your safety comes before work 100% of the time. He was being creepy and dangerous, and the fact he made a pass at you as a supervisor is unprofessional. If there’s no HR or anyone above him you can file a case with, just quit.
It's unfortunate that awkward interactions happen. Legally and socially, most people are in agreement that the best thing to do is directly address the issue ASAP. Pretending that OP has already done (or that the OP definitely describes that) that is a disservice to OP. It's a legally incorrect analysis IMO.
