The child was 4 years old at the time. There is no GAL. This is a final order. I did not have some required paperwork ready at the first hearing because my lawyer did not tell me I needed to. The Judge was exceeding angry about this, apparently at me. Following that, she was hostile to anything and everything my attorney proposed and denied every motion he made. Other than that, I cannot think of any reason for her attitude toward me, although I have been told by other attorneys that she has a reputation for "picking a side very quickly" in most of the cases she hears, and treating the other side poorly. If this is true, I seem to be the side she didn't pick.
Interstate child custody/visitation is by default expensive. Many parents choose to combat this by moving closer to the child so that they can access the child without these additional costs. Practically, you may want to think of making this move in order to have your child in your life and more easily allow you to work up to shared custody.
