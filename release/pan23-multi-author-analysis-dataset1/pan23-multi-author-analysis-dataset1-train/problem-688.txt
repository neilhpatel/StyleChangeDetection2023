Sometimes a book gloriously whacks you on the head with a blind spot in your thinking. For me it was the impact of Eastern removal on the nations living in the Zone of Removal, including the Osage, Omahas, Pawnee, Witchitas, Caddos, and Quapaws. I knew tens of thousands of Native Americans were forced westward, but I guess my brain forgot they weren't moving into vacant land. The arrival of these refugees set off dominoes of population movement across the west, and set the stage for prolonged conflict in the West. One heart rending discussion involved the Kanzas. Scholars of the escalation leading to the Civil War know about Bleeding Kansas. An amazing deep dive by Ostler showed how, as pro or antislavery forces flooded into Kansas in an attempt to control the slavery debate, those settlers were stealing Kanzas land, with disastrous consequences. They were asked to vacate their reservation, begged surrounding nations to survive for two landless years, and were finally granted another reservation smack in the middle of the Santa Fe Trail. Disease and dispossession followed.
This book sounds great but I think I might wait for a year that's less of a dumpster fire to read it. I'm not sure my soul could take reading a book about genocide right now...
Understandable. The book does detail great stories of perseverance, resistance, and negotiation. Not all bad.
Primarily i am interested how the political system developed, how the interactions between civil and military institutions worked and the legal framework that was in place. But all general suggestions of books on politics, law, economics or culture in this timeframe are appreciated.
