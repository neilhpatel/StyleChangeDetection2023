The g√©nocidaires went ahead with their killings in several ways. One instance was the "killing in the neighbourhood", which was a "door-to-door campaign" and meant that the killers knew where Tutsi were living. This was based on IDs, wherever it was not your own neighbours participating in your death. In the early stages, Dallaire reported that there were instances of teachers filing lists of their classes, dividing the pupils into Tutsi and Hutu and forwarding those lists to sources close to or identical with the Interahamwe (Hutu extremists, mostly young people and even children, which acted as paramilitary arm of the Hutu extremist party MRND).
Yes, thanks for those additionnal facts that I didn't know about. Btw concerning the book I was talking about, it's in fact an article that i read a long time ago and actually didn't finish and thought it was an extract from a book but no it's just an article, I just read it entirely a few minutes ago and apparently it makes the physical appearance and especially the nose an important dimension of the genocide. Here is the link.
When the first reports about the planning of what became the genocide emerged, they were accompanied by details about groups forming, being equipped with weapons and down the road with the knowledge about where Tutsi and/or moderate Hutu lived in the close vicinity. This was build upon existing political movements, whose branches were already familiar with the surroundings they were operating in and the people living there. Major coordination came from the top but the actual work was mostly done locally.
