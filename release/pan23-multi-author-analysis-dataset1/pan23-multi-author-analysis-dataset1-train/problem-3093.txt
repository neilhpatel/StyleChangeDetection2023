There are towns like that all over the country, all of them stagnant and dying, all of them vote Republican en masse. Vidor, Texas, Harrison, Arkansas, Winnemucca, Nevada. There are probably a ton of towns like that within a day's drive of wherever you live. People need to see what rural Republican America is all about. There are a lot less farmers and a lot more meth addicts.
I’m actually acknowledging that the status quo is capitalism and this hypothetical transition you’re proposing would occur during the status quo. Because of the reality of capitalism, it’s more likely poor people get stuck in fascist former red states than neo-liberal blue states fund their travel.
By supporting a divorce of red and blue states, you’re supporting the consequences of such an act — which includes poor working class people getting stuck in red areas that will no longer support them. Abandonment of the working class is the opposite of collectivism.
