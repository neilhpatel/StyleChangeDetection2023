But the main thing about modern films is they give a very particular image of a Roman Legionary that isn't necessarily entirely wrong but kind of suggests a greater degree of uniformity between individual soldiers and across space and time that didn't exist so much.
No. I don't know. Armour is expensive before the industrial revolution and so making armour just for the sake of doing it is hard, as is replicating paintings. So I would put an early limit on this to be something like 1850 when photography and replicate art could become affordable to the masses.

We also might tend to overemphasize the city of Rome in our imagination during the late imperial age too, Ravenna and Mediolanum were both capitals and more populated, and there is of course Constantinople (called at the time Nova Roma). Some emperors barely knew Rome, many perhaps only going to the city to get confirmed by the senate as emperor and leaving on campaigns for years, often rising through the ranks from the provinces as commanders in armies who ultimately won out in a succession struggle which may or may not have been caused by them assassinating the old emperor.
