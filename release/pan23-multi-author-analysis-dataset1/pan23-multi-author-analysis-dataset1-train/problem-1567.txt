Generally speaking, victims have no additional rights to things like court transcripts as the general public has. That said, they are almost always public record, although identifying information about you/victims is likely obscured to "SC" (or your initials, rather.) There are some exceptions, but not an awful lot.
i did edit the post to clarify that i did not testify and i definitely agree about the person giving me information being unreliable haha - without giving too much personal info my younger sister found out about this before i did, confronted my parents, and they told her not to tell me so she got a second hand account and therefore doesnt know much more than i do. i wanted to see my options for getting more information for that reason specifically since my parents are not willing to talk about this and therefore i dont have a reliable account of what actually happened.
i am just going off of information from somebody else so i dont know much about it - i have tried asking my parents and they arent willing to talk about it.
