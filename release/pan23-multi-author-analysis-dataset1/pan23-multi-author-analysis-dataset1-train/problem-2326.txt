Depends on the perspective, but overall bad for the country as a whole. The economy and many other facets of a country are tied to population. To have a aging population of billions of people, no longer able to work and retiring, without a sufficient influx of new, younger and able bodied replacements to sustain the country’s production, cover the social safety net costs, etc. means that things can fall apart very fast.
One very interesting consequence of the one-child policy is that it promoted individualism and to some degree, gender equality.
The US lost over a million to COVID. China (no matter what the government says) has had to lose more based on population alone. Same with India. The poors don’t get counted or neglected to get counted.
There's possibly an alternative to this deterioration, and Japan might be the best place to find out (as their population peaked a bit over a decade ago), but it would need some careful management by various levels of government and some heavy duty social security structures. I'm not sure whether China scores highly on either of those measures, probably not. It could be a long period of internal instability ahead for China once the population decline really bites. Countries have been known to deal with internal difficulties by going to war with other countries.
