In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Unions as a whole are good. Unions individually are sometimes capable of being bad or doing certain bad things. Police unions are a great example of unions that are just flat out bad. Teachers unions are an example of good unions that do a bad thing (they make it impossible to fire teachers for anything short of literally beating a child). But that’s not the point. Police unions are fucking terrible and have way too much power.
