I voted for him. He's not fit for office at this point. He needs to step down and be replaced by another D.
Ramifications? Not much, for brief absence. With him in office, the Senate is 49-51; without him, 50-50 but Harris always breaks ties, so he’s not really needed to pass bills—assuming manchin & sinema vote D.

I pray that he really takes stock, puts his recovery first now, but he doesn’t have a good track record: ignored doctors advice, stopped taking meds after first diagnosed with HBP/heart failure in 2017; insisted on resuming grueling campaign for senate after near fatal, incapacitating heart attack/stroke in 2022; hospitalized twice in one month in 2023, then staff issues statement vowing his return to senate duties “ in a few weeks”. 🙄.
The expected lenh of Fetterman’s hospital stay was reported hours after his office revealed that the 53-year-old freshman lawmaker checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on Wednesday night.
BTW, where did you hear TWELVE WEEKS? The story headline says “a few weeks”. If he was going to be incapacitated for 3 months, even the dem party will start demanding he resign.
