Awhile back though, we added the 'Dark Horse' Award to our monthly (and Yearly) awards, which was specifically to ensure we were always recognizing a non-flaired user for their contributions since, for obvious reasons, Flairs win most of the awards. Figuring out some way to ensure we are similarly including recognition of the less-frequented topics is something definitely worth considering as well, so we'll definitely do some brainstorming on how something like this might work moving forward.
Sorry you feel that way. While I respect that there are alternative interpretations of historic events, I'm not sure this sub is about those disagreements. I look to this sub to get an idea of whatever the current consensus opinion is on one history question or another. As a history buff who's not a historian, I leave the arguing to you folks. The argument itself doesn't interest me. I just want the latest sausage, I don't want to watch the sausage being made.
I'm currently reading through your response for the first time and given the little if any coverage the Troubles get in American education it's been incredibly enlightening to say the least It's something i've always wondered about but like the OP was a little intimidated trying to learn about it but your answer has been very approachable. Thanks for the work you put into it.
