It’s not just you…companies withhold from all employees and then remit to the 401(k) provider in one chunk with instructions on how to allocate to participant accounts. You should not expect this to hit your account the next day, since companies may do their disbursement runs on set days of the week and that may be variable based on pay timing. You should, however, expect the funds within 7 days at the very latest, and you should see consistency in that timing. 401(k) sponsors are on the hook for potential lost participant earnings from late remittances (after all, you would be earning a return during that period where they’re holding onto your money instead of depositing it). 401k compliance can be messy and small (unsophisticated) companies often get it wrong…doesn’t mean there’s any ill intent. Just keep your eye on it but this to me is not cause for aggressive escalation based on the fact pattern you laid out.
Former pension/401k administrator here. The law generally requires that 401(k) deferrals are deposited to an account "as soon as administratively possible". That's the standard I recall.
