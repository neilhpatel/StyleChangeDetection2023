Truly strong leadership is born from constructive conflict, from the clash of ideas and from being able to jointly arrive at either the objective truth or an equitable compromise. It means being able to convince others - not through threats but through a change of heart. Silencing critics and censoring opposing opinions is nothing more than pathetic cowardice.
Yep! Just counting soldiers of both sides alone, we're nearing 200,000. And then there are all the civilians Russia massacred. We know for a fact they were particularly hateful of Mariupol.
Religion sets people up to not question authority (patriarchal punishment, threat of eternal Hell if not compliant to set law and order within theocratical parameters) and what they're told from early childhood (creating difficulty in determining fact from fiction and literally robs an individual of critical thinking skills before entering adulthood, which is the entire point) and corporate marketing toys with human psychology and neurologic chemistry sets (dopamine, serotonin level manipulation, chemical addiction, environmental, product and consumable stimulus and goal-to-reward schemes), especially with children, to set up life-long brand recognition and trust with that branding. Nestle for example, excels with creating the problem of choice (analysis paralysis) with innumerous companies producing multiple corporate product lines with all profit fed toward one major and global umbrella company. Samsung and Mitsubishi also come to mind.
