As said in answers about Valhalla, such as by /u/Steelcan909 : We don't know that Valhalla 'was a thing'. Certainly there was obviously a folk tale about it but that does not mean it was necessarily taken seriously as theology. (consider for instance stories about Santa Claus, are popular but not really an accurate reflection of sincerly held Christian beliefs or the veneration of Saint Nicholas).
How can this be you might ask? Norse mythology is almost as well known these days as Greek mythology, surely we have an extensive source basis to rely on such as the Sagas? Unfortunately however, we cannot treat the sources available to us like we would religious texts such as the Bible, Talmud, or Koran. The only literary sources on Norse religion come from outsiders, ie Adam of Bremen and Ibn Fadlan, or are centuries removed from the actual practice of Norse religion, ie the Sagas. The Sagas in particular come in for a hard time when it comes to their accuracy in regards to Norse religious practices. They were compiled in a specific cultural context (13th century Iceland) and for specific aims (to legitimize and glorify extant Icelandic families for the most part), and not to accurately retell the beliefs of the pre-Christian Norse. Indeed Iceland had become Christian some two centuries before the Sagas were written down. For reference, the United States has existed for about 250 years, and religious expression has changed dramatically in the intervening centuries. Imagine how religious practice might be different in the absence of what we take for granted in religion today such as professional clergy, written scriptures, dedicated houses of worship, and so on.
