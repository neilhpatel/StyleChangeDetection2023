But DeSantis has some other governing responsibilities, too. One of them is looking out for the health and economic well-being of Florida residents, including those who can’t pay for medical care on their own because they don’t have insurance.
Yup. I previously lived in Pennsylvania and had medicaid because of my income and medical conditions but when I moved to Florida their first question was "do you have children or are you pregnant?" I said no, and they said "well you do not qualify" and ended the conversation. Just like that.
Thanks, but we are a population of 22 Million people and the best candidate the Democrats could offer was a guy who use to be the Republican governor, flipped independent, the flipped Democrat and already lost the Senate race to Rubio in 2010 (like to thank the fucking moron Democrat Meek who refused to drop out of that race...).
It’s not culture wars. It is political games Anything to stay in the headlines for his run for president. He doesn’t care who he hurts or kills to get there.
