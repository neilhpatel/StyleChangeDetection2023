Maybe they are floating the possibility to make it sound plausible, so that if one of the guards becomes "hypnotized" and takes him out, they can claim it wasn't their fault?
"Oh, definitely! My dad had it last week. Took out a fascist dictator and woke up the next morning with a hangover. Can't fault him, of course, he was hypnotized, after all.".
It wasn't exactly Karpov doing the 'hypnotizing' he was just mad dogging Korchnoi; it was Vladimir Zukhar, a parapsychologist in Karpov's entourage, that Korchnoi suspected of hypnotizing him and interfering with his brainwaves.
Yes. His logistics thinking was awful. Plus he was far too involved in lower level decisions. Later in the war, he demanded that a main tank turret be placed on ball bearings rather than cheaper, easier-to-produce bushings. Bearings were certainly better, but caused production to be very slow. On top of that, ball bearings were produced in a single factory, which the allies bombed. There are many stories where he demanded that stuff was the biggest and best, and none of it was feasible or could be made quickly.
