I think we need some primary polling. DeSantis polls well against him amongst GOP voters, but are the people that want DeSantis people that will show up to primaries? IDK. I feel like the red in their bones Republicans still like Trump and they're the ones that vote in the primaries.

Let’s be real here; the DOJ is going to do a half-assed dog&pony show trial with Trump, the worst punishment he’ll get is fines & a ban from holding office again, the GOP & enough Americans will be satisfied enough with that punishment that Trump will stop being a major issue in politics, and meanwhile even more dangerous fascists like DeSantis will continue grabbing the power levers in this country while the Democrats stand by and rake in their cut from the donor class in exchange for not stopping it. And Kanye’s mental health spiral will help keep the rest of us distracted after that.
