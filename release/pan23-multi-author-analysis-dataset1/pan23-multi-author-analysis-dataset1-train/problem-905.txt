In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
That's true. However the law is cleverly written to include heterosexuality as well. The law bans any talk of sexuality (gay or straight) or gender identity in grades K-3.

As for the "Don't Say Gay bill." That's not changing. And Disney doesn't have the financial standing right now to continue fighting the state from an activist angle. Disney won't change their company culture of inclusion and tolerance as far as their company is concerned. But I don't think you will see Iger continue to fight a cultural war against a governor that just won re-election by 20 points. Disney needs Florida. They can't pick up and move the Magic Kingdom. Florida is not California, and looks like it never will be. So the company will need to find a happy balance to get along with Florida politicians and keep everyone happy. That's just the reality of the situation.
Let me give you a dose of reality. That bill will NEVER be repealed. You have a governor that just won re-election by 20 points. You have a legislature that a super-majority of Republicans. You have a voting electorate that just overthrew dozens of school boards so they can eliminate "woke" curriculums. Yet you seem to think Disney has the ability to force the state to repeal that law? What cards do you think Disney has?
