They will pay it either way this is just a pre election smokescreen,why,because he has the goods on them before he became president and collected more when he was,thats the lessons he’s learned from his mentor,Cohn, he has to run again he cannot possibly leave all that money on the table,running again gets him out of the jam,legally he’s in,plus with GOP taking over congress he will have NFL level defense with plenty of people willing to fall on the proverbial sword,top all this off with the republicans controlling congress there is a great chance he will win,a gerrymandering of the nation if not total is a lot easier with this Supreme Court then after elections will no longer on problem. It will be over,they got the money.
