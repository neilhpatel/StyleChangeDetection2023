What sort of topics did they use Latin for? Sexual crimes, specifically, or anything they considered especially distasteful? I ask because I recall a disturbing segment in Samuel Pepys's (is that the proper punctuation?) diaries where he quite jauntily describes raping a servant girl, and lapses into French when he gets to the actual deed. Same principle?
In this book, Latin is typically used for citations of texts written in that language and for some legal terms, but it's only in the chapter about the "Crimes against nature" that Latin is used to describe the three acts themselves: masturbation, homosexuality and bestiality. The latter two are punished by death at the stake while masturbation is punished by banishment when such a case is tried in court (Rousseaud notes wisely that "this can only happen rarely" and that God will be the one to exact punishment). Otherwise, all other "fornication" crimes - abortion, prostitution, incest, rape etc. - are described in French. There's a whole chapter dedicated to official torture methods, and it's also in French.
