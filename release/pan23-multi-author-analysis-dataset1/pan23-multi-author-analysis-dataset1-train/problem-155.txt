Old George is probably fairly well off and lives in a privileged bubble that isolates him from the fact that for millions of people both here in the US and around the world that this is hardly an 'age of plenty'. And there are many people here who would likely be considered as part of the 'middle' or even 'upper middle' class who are walking a razor's edge between one side where they (barely) manage to maintain their standard of living and another where a job loss or some other disaster could put them on the road to bankruptcy and/or homelessness.
Plenty of what? Cheap mass manufactured crap with no resale value? Plenty of opportunities to have people hate on you for existing? Plenty of opportunities to get shot in a public place? Plenty of evidence that your future vanishing and to discover you have no influence in the matter? Plenty of time to realize that dying from an entirely treatable medical condition is a reality you may very well face in the near future?
