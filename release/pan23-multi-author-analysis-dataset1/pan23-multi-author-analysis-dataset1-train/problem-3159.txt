A suit isn't too much. Don't wear a tux like you're going to a black tie party, but a nice professional-looking navy suit is a good choice. You don't need to break the bank; judges typically understand that a defendant might have financial limitations and can't dress the way they'd expect of, say, an attorney.
2. How to prevent this from happening in the future. Do you need to change your relationship with alcohol or other intoxicants? Do you need to rearrange who you spend time with or how you spend time with them? Has your family or other background left you with issues around managing emotions that need to be dealt with? If there are actions for you to take that might help, take these actions. Your financial and emotional and relationship health and wealth will be very very different in three, five, ten years if this does (or doesn't) become a pattern for you. (Or if it is already a pattern, if you stop the cycle.) You're smart enough to think ahead about the suit, so you're definitely smart enough to think this through too. (Being smart enough doesn't make these changes easy, but it helps.).
1. What you will say if asked to speak. Listen carefully to your lawyer on this. Be authentic. Feel how you could have avoided this, take responsibility, and show that. Think about how this could have gone worse, be grateful that it didn't, and show that. And also... see next point.
