Building new houses so that they can be bought up by real estate investment groups at inflated prices and rented out for massive profits will not solve the housing problem even for people with good jobs. The government needs to start prioritizing homes for families instead of for corporate profits.

Lower property taxes are part of the perverse incentives that keep local municipalities from approving higher density housing.
4. Subsidize home loans or provide low interest/no interest loans (this can only be done if the above 3 are being done, in order to prevent subsidized demand without a subsequent increase in supply).
They aren't. Feel free to look at the laws as they're written if you don't like the explanation from the DoJ in Canada.
