Teens are literally mentally handicapped. Growth hormones plus undeveloped brain equals really dumb decisions that a fully cognizant (i.e. adult) version of themselves wouldn't make.
Retribution. Which is a perfectly valid desire for a victim. You are espousing it as fact that criminal justice should only be about rehab. That is not true.
Focus on rehabilitation. Not to play the race card but the fact that there's mention of the girls' ethnicity makes me believe they're non-white as well, which will play a role since Trudeau wants to make the prison system more progressive by keeping minority incarcerations' stats low.
3. If it's impossible to rehabilitate them, I'd want them put to death. No one benefits from them languishing in prison.
Prison should never be a solution. If someone is impossible to rehabilitate, they should be put to death. If someone can be rehabilitated then they should be, so they can return to society to make reparations.
If they're rehabed, then they aren't destroying more lives, they're spending the rest of their life making reparations for a mistake they made that got someone killed.
Don't you think the victim's family would be better off getting a percentage of all money the murderer makes for the rest of their life? Isn't that better than the "satisfaction" of knowing the murderer is behind bars?
