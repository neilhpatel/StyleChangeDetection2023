When I first moved to Atlanta, I chose my apartment in part because it had frequent direct bus service to my job. It was great for a few months until MARTA re-did the buses and I had to walk a half a mile each way to get the stop for a route that came less often and only got to within a couple of blocks of my office.
Why? Because among affluent, young, (largely white) professionals (the main drivers of gentrification) there is a pervasive bias that buses are dangerous, confusing, and only for poor people but trains and streetcars are OK.
Yep. Instead of funding a big, inflexible fixed grid of streetcars and waiting for its eventual completion, they could start right now by buying one bus for less than 500,000 dollars, put it on the street tomorrow, and change the route the day after tomorrow if that turned out to make better sense. Then buy another bus. And another. Grow it and shift it as needed.
I read the article you’re talking about and it actually presents him as pretty altruistic, it specifically says he doesn’t usually have an ulterior motive.
Yep. It's easy to to end up with some short inflexible route that doesn't serve enough of the people who need transportation.
