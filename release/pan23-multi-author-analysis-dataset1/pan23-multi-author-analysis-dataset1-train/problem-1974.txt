The fact that some poor gullible folks were convinced to throw their few dollars into it is sad and I do feel bad for them. I just really think it's blown up as big when truly, that's a scant minority of who lost money, it's most entirely just people who threw cash at it when they had plenty left over. Boohoo to them, they're always the cause of big headlines though.
I'd have preferred legalizing drugs or decriminalizing them, getting in safe facilities to do the drugs which help people quit or at the least not fucking die (there's tons of info that proves these facilities help decrease deaths to actually 0 from OD-ing and increase drug seeker's addiction recovery), and tax and regulate them to make sure they don't get to kids and help our towns.
