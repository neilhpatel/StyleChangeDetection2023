I deeply appreciate the advice. If it wouldn’t trouble you, could you possibly provide the actual name of the site you would like to link me to? I don’t doubt your intentions of helping me, but I would feel safer to find it on my own instead of clicking links. Thank you.
Thank you for your reply. To answer your question, no. He was actually quite out of shape, but I didn’t have the bravery to force him off when it came to that. I would simply freeze in those moments. During that time, I believed because of our ages, I would be arrested for that factor, and I was asked by my school to inform my dad about my involvement. So if I immediately told him that it was SA after getting in the car, that would sound embarrassing. I also preferred to not have to go through more stress. So I decided it wasn’t worth it. Today I do have a support system of my mom and friends. It probably wouldn’t be fair of me to attempt to press charges today as my ex is currently homeless, addicted to drugs, and has a horrible life as is.
I completely understand. If it helps at all, Virginia has a 2 year SOL for title IX claims, and 5 years for breach of contract. You also don’t have to go after only one. I have many clients who have sought claims against both the individual and the school.
