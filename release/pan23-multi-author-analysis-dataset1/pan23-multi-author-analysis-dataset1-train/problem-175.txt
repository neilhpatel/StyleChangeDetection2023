This is just an aside, but in 1962 there was no way for the US President to directly call the head of the Soviet Union. All of the communication between the US and the USSR during the Cuban Missile Crisis was done via telegrams between the White House and the Soviet embassy, and the latter then using some form of telegraphy to communicate with Moscow. This caused considerable difficulties; the Soviets were famously worried that the Wester Union boy who communicated between the White House and the embassy might be delayed for one reason or another. The result of these difficulties led to the establishment of the "hot line" between the White House and the Kremlin, which was just a direct civilian phone connection (and not to my knowledge secured against interception or nuclear attack). But a lot better than nothing!
The operator (based on the caller’s request) would manually set up a call to a particular place, but it could take (depending on destination) anywhere from 20 minutes to a few days to make a connection. The problems were essentially technical; the number of trunk lines going from the US to the USSR was small (around 30) and the phone network on the USSR’s side was not advanced.
The phone network in the USSR was never given high priority, and a lot of the lines were for institutional purposes (in the 1960s, 90% of households in the US had telephones; I don’t have a 1960s comparison number for the USSR, but in 1980 only 23% of urban and 8% of rural households had a telephone line). This is why contact time took a while; sound quality was allegedly also rather bad.
