We have a lock in / lock out system for our equipment that is no longer functional, so as a result there isn't any reprimand for "losing" the equipment. This has driven the employees to a) leave the equipment in and around the workplace area instead of lock them back in, or b) hide the equipment out of fear that someone else manages to lose them.
This is repesentative of how co-workers at my workplace hide equipment because they think we're hiding them, and now both shifts have no equipment to use because it's all hidden everywhere. Being malicious does absolutely nothing for anybody.
I notice you didn't highlight the cost of the fencing devices. My suspicion is it's because those aren't cheap... because nobody has ever described Cisco as cheap.
REPUBLICAN poll worker. Very important to point that out in a time like this,before all the MAGA Facebook mom's start circulating this as proof of the big lie bullshit.
