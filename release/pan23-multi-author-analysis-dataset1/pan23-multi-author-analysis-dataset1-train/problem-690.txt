Russians' problem is that they hate themselves and everyone else. Even their own families. Any young Russian, I'd suggest to go and visit their grandparents. Or neighbors. Talk to them. Show them truth. Tell them that they don't want to die in a war with all the false reasons. Start giving a fuck so they'd start giving a fuck. Maybe buy them a smart TV for new year and teach them a bit, so they could watch youtube or different channels. Maybe those grandparents will wise up and won't throw their votes in the Putin's trashcan. And keep prepping up the government that kills their own children and grandchildren. As saying goes, even God doesn't help those who don't want to help themselves.
Western Intelligence disputes these numbers, specifically deaths. It tends to be exaggerated as it is part propaganda part fact. The source always matters and in this case you gotta take stats published by UA with a grain of salt. Most Western Intelligence agree that the 100k number is a mixture of KIA and WIA. In the case of UK Intel, they also included deserters as part of the 100k. Intel comes from multiple sources including boots on the ground, AID agencies, OSINT, etc. Russia, as an example claims more than 160k UA military KIA. But who knows if they are actually counting combatant AND civilian deaths.
