3D printing a handgun is currently a lot more involved than mail ordering a Polymer 80 kit and removing a few bits of plastic. Of course this ruling won’t completely prevent illegal possession of handguns, but it will reduce distribution to people who are prohibited from possessing firearms. If 3D printing becomes cheap and easy enough for anybody to do it, then that’s a different issue to address.
While 3D printing isn't terribly insurmountable, it is still a way, way higher bar than a hand drill and some files. In the case of a Glock, you still need to purchase or fabricate the metal rails and the rest of the parts, even on a 3D printed frame. After your stuff comes in, you can either 3D print and fuck around with getting the right 3D model, waiting many hours to fuck up the first print, repeating multiple times, and finally maybe getting something that will work, or you can buy the 80% lower and be committing your crime in a little less than an hour. I've done both (well, not the crime part. I legally register any guns I build like my state requires me to do) and to call the two paths equivalent is silly.
