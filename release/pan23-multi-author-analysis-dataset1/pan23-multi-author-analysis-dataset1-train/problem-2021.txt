I'm convinced that this is red states' strategy with abortion too. I would have been willing to move to a red or purple state prior to that, but now educated women largely won't want to go to these places, and so educated men who are want to find a partner/are in a relationship will have more reasons to avoid them as well.
Penalties will be levied. It even mentions not contributing to conservatives and conservative pacs. Google ALEC free speech.

Pretty much. "Patriotic Education" is just a code word for far-right indoctrination. You can already see this happening in red states. Books about LGBT issues are being pulled out of libraries, lessons about civil rights, diversity, and inclusion are being pulled from the curriculum, and school staff are being forced out so that their positions will be filled by far-right ideologues. They're trying to hold onto power forever by molding Generation Alpha into the most conservative, religious, and bigoted generation yet, and they are currently winning.
The Koch brothers back around 2014? Tried to take over the economics department at the university of Florida through donations, they only wanted ultra right wing economist teaching the economy classes. Moving ahead today Alec is pushing the woke agenda in the south. They are trying to get red states in the south to a sign on. Basically if your company subscribes to no guns allowed, not investing in gun companies and there are other industries.
