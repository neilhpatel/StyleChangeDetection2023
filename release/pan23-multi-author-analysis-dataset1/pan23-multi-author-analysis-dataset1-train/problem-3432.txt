If you have a mentor or trusted other teacher I might discuss with them whether the fight or objection, which by definition forces you to argue your own lack of understanding sort of basic testing procedures, makes you better or worse.
Nothing happened at all. I was simply talking with my co-workers and brought it up. We always talk about work, our methods, what we're doing. Thats how i got into this predicament. I wasn't panicking about anything because someone who actually has more experience (in education, teaching, and at the school), qualifications, and better results told me this was a method they used and that I should use.
You are right. My statement wasn't exact enough. I think OP should state that it was caused by a misunderstanding and that as soon as he understood his mistake he took measures to correct it. As a first year teacher, I think such an explanation could be accepted. In any case, it is better than signing a document saying that he intentionally cheated which according to OP is not even true.
