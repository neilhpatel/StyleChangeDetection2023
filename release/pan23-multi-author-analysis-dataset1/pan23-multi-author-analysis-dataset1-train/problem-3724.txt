But what I will say is that Democrats have been trying to convince swing voters for my entire lifetime and I haven't seen it work yet; passing legislation doesn't convince swing voters, signing laws doesn't convince swing voters, campaigning and messaging doesn't convince swing voters, track records don't convince swing voters, state governance doesn't convince swing voters, hell, an violent armed insurrection perpetrated exclusively by one party at their party leader's public behest didn't seem to convince swing voters.

No, I'm not telling you to stop, I'm telling you that I'm frustrated as fuck that because Democrats didn't put the fire out fast enough American voters are going to reelect the arsonists, I'm frustrated that it takes more than a single Congressional term to fix half a century of Republican forced negligence, I'm frustrated that it takes a decade to win back legislative control of the government and then the electorate gives it away two years later. You should keep doing what you're doing, because you're doing the right thing, you're doing the best thing anyone can - but you can only convince swing voters if they're willing to listen and it seems to me like they're not.
It might also just be time to realize that Democrats, liberals, and progressives are on our own, swing voters and non-voters don't have our back.
