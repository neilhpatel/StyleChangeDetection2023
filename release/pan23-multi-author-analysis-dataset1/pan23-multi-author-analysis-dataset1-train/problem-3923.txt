While conducting research in Ireland, 1981-1982, I spoke with a young woman from Kerry who said that she believed in the fairies when she was home, but that she found the belief fall away when attending university in Dublin - only to have the belief resurrect when returning home. That fluidity serves as a nice expression of how folk belief can come and go. The subjects of beliefs mutate and some may drop off, but because folklore is ubiquitous, belief persists. There is no set time when disbelief became prevalent although it has always been believed to be "the previous generation." One can argue that the time of disbelief has yet to be attained (and likely never will) since every generation attaches itself to some belief structure.
In fact, there has long been a perception that "our current time" (whenever that is) is less superstitious and gullible/believing than the previous generations. This perception is documented in Chaucer, for example. The following is an excerpt from my recent (2018):
That's fascinating. I originally thought that Irish pre Christianity beliefs have been eradicated during the spread of Christianity.
