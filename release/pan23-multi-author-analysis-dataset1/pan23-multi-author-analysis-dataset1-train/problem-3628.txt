They didn't stop the Quran burnings, it was requested once more after the initial burning and the police just said they wouldn't hold the perimeter. I can still go to sweden, grab a Quran and burn it.
Sweden was providing around 10 million euro a year to Turkey through Sida (the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) even before the earthquakes, with 94% of it going to reform work (including developing infrastructure, helping with climate work, improving education, strenhening equality and human rights, etc) and 6% going to humanitarian aid.
I wish. Hungary is too insignificant for that. At most, they'll find something to get Orb치n to capitulate quickly. Orb치n is hoping to hold the application process hostage in order to get some concessions from the EU.
This is likely going to happen because Orb치n has done this before within the EU, where he holds an important process hostage in order to gain concessions for his regime. We seen it happen under COVID and under sanctions. This is the only position Orb치n has left within the EU where he has any negotiating power because he has systematically destroyed almost all of Hungary's diplomatic relationships within the EU.
