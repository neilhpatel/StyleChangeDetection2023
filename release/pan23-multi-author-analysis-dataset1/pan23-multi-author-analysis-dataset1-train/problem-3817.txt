Vickie Paladino, the Republican City Council representative in Santos's district, is supposedly sweating over her reelection campaign. Santos is toxic and the win at any cost ideology drags everyone down long term. The voters in the area are largely conservative democrats who can just as quickly drop a Republican.
Really? So it's just the Republicans who can't be tasked with these "simple duties"? So what is the answer to you then, for the direction and future of our country? Vote Democrat no matter what, for the rest of our lives? Then that's voting in whoever has a "D" next to their name - in other words, walking the party line and doing nothing else. And that's exactly what you're accusing Republicans of doing (which IS true, however, voting Democrat is NOT the answer).
