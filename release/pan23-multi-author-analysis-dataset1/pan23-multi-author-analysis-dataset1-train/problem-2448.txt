There was only a short period of time where the government was unable to use any of the documents seized in any ongoing investigations. The all-important marked-as-classified documents were enjoined for an even shorter time. Garland said that they were still early in their investigation, and the appointment of the Special Counsel is more of an additional measure in an already ongoing proceeding, as opposed to it's own investigation. In the meantime, all of the court decisions are finding against Trump, Jan 6th insurrectionists are being sentenced, and the arguments Trump will likely use as a defense have already been heard in court which could help establish precedent in any upcoming indictments. In my opinion, the writing is on the wall. Announcing his "presidency" two years early is a transparent attempt to gain some type of magical immunity. This whole shebang is heading to court, and we'll finally get some answers, one way or the other.
