I would be excited if all they did is nothing. They're going to spend the next two years flooding the zone with bullshit instead.
Introspection is important here. Yes the Republicans have done poorly in the past election cycles but McDaniel is not the only reason. The Republican Party is losing suburbanites and wealthy voters and are having a rough time with millennials and Gen Zâ€™ers. This is due to their policies and rhetoric on issues such as immigration, abortion, and voting rights to name a few. It does not look good for a party that has 15 votes to elect a speaker. It does not look good for a party that should have had an election cycle that rivaled 1994 or 2010 and end up having the worst performance for a party out of power. This is due to weak candidates that primary voters voted for and unpopular stances and making issues that seem irrelevant to voters overall become huge issues because of out of step stances. Worse, it does not help that the party in Congress is proposing a 30% national sales tax. Or in Michigan, the Democratic governor is proposing a bill to have universal pre-K but in Oklahoma, Republicans are proposing bills to fine people for using certain pronouns. Or in Florida, it would be a felony for teachers to have certain books in their classrooms. This paints a part as out of step on certain issues and looks like a party that does not seem serious in governing or helping people.
