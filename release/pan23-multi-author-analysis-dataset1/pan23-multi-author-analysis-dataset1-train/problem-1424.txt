You're slightly misquoting me, but my main point is that Turkey is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. There are two main fault lines crossing the country, along which any building code should always consider the structural integrity of buildings during 7.5+ earthquakes. If this isn't the case, it's a failure of the government to either implement or to enforce them. In case of the Erdogan government, we know it's both.

actually, no. people can't imagine things beyond their mind. recently, the warming of the oceans was compared to atomic bombs. for 24 / 7 / 365, every second five atomic bombs in the size of Hiroshima need to detonate under water, to release the same amount of energy. such things are totally unimaginable.
