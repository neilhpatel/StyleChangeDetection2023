You do not ever make less money net from making more money gross due to taxes. There's a few screwball "donut holes" dealing with entitlements where you start making enough money to no longer qualify for assistance but don't actually make enough money to offset the loss of assistance. Say you get $500/mo for some rental assistance program and you start making +$300/mo and now you don't qualify for the rental assistance. In terms of actual money in your pocket, your raise cost you $200/mo. But such situations are pretty uncommon and have nothing to do with taxes.
