If the original gift (fiancée's parents to OP) carried the condition that they get married (I think this could be argued in court if it went that far), and then a second condition was set up between OP and fiancée, it could be argued that in the case of break-up the ring would revert to OP and then back to fiancée's parents.
I was going to say this. I often see people asking about having to return an engagement ring if they didn’t get married. Most people I see try to say it was a gift and they don’t have to return it but that’s often not the case because, usually, an engagement ring falls under the category of a conditional gift and if the condition of getting married isn’t met a lot of times a judge will require it be returned. This case is a bit sticky because they gave it to him to give to their daughter. I don’t know if this means it is a conditional gift because it wasn’t given by him to her. Either way, whether it falls under the category of a conditional gift or not, if they get married the parents definitely can’t do a single thing because the condition was met (assuming it is a conditional gift). If it isn’t technically a conditional gift and they don’t get married the right thing would be to give it to her anyway and I hope that happens if for some reason they change their mind.
