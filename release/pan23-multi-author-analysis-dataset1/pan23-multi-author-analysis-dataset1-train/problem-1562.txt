Woodstovia covered the first one well in their comment -- Roehm was a capable soldier and logistician for the cause, and the Nazis needed him. Hitler needed him. Roehm was actually a bigger deal than Hitler when they were starting out in Bavaria in the early 20s, and even as the movement grew Roehm retained his own source of independent authority as the leader of the SA militia. According to a many sources, the two got along well together and even used the informal "du" address, which Hitler only allowed few people to use. From my reading of the sources, they actually liked each other. But then of course any personal friendship they may have had didn't stop Hitler in the slightest when murdering Roehm became politically convenient.
Hitler didn't have Roehm killed because he was gay, but once he did kill him that was his excuse. In his famous speech after the Night of the Long Knives, he told the nation that he had discovered a homosexual plot among Nazi ranks, had acted to purge it, and now every mother can trust giving her son to the Party without him getting molested. I'm paraphrasing obviously, but that was the main story. (The other strain of the speech was Roehm's supposed socialist plot against Hitler, which was entirely invented.).
Hitler also overlooked the homosexuality of General Werner von Fritsch in 1936 and ordered Himmler to destroy a file of the SS' investigation into this when Himmler confronted him. This seems to have been driven again by usefulness, Fritsch was the supreme commander of the army and was a key figure in expanding it. When von Fritsch began to protest against Hitler's plans of expansion Hitler reopened the case (although it was later proven that General von Fritsch wasn't actually homosexual and had been confused for Captain von Fritsch who was).
