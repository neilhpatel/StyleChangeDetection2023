Omar Mateen, the perpetrator of the deadly 2016 shooting at the Pulse LGBT nightclub, reportedly scouted Disney locations during Gay Days before deciding to target a club outside Downtown Orlando, Florida.
Moving all of that would be a herculean effort. It simply isn't practical. At best, Disney could launch a new Disney park in a friendlier state and slowly build that up. Still, that would need decades just to be seen as a viable alternative to Disney World.
There's no way Disney can relocate. Have you ever been to Disney World? I have and it's HUGE. There isn't just the Magic Kingdom, but Epcot, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom. Then there are water parks (though I think one of them is closed at the moment), a shopping complex, and tons of hotels. And all this are just the public facing areas. They are a lot more areas that are employees only.
If the Reedy Creek police end up being replaced by local police from Buena Vista or Orange County, this could potentially result in a law enforcement vacuum at the parks, which may result in a heightened risk of anti-LGBT activities during Gay Days (other than that annoying plane flying the banners).
Desantis and friends are fighting a war they can not win. They donâ€™t have the cash on hand. Disney does.
