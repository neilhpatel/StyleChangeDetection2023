Unlike some peoples fears about vote siphoning, i think gallego has a solid chance. I feel like even independents will be wary of sinema knowing that she already fucked over one group of voters when she didnt get her way. Gallego will be able to say to both dems and independents "im consistent and you know exactly where my values lie". that is definitely a good sell.
All I'm saying is that anyone thinking Democrats "shouldn't put forward a candidate" for this race is suggesting something impossible under Arizona nominating procedures - the state party can't decide to do what the Utah Dems did with McMullin. There will be someone who runs as a Democrat and qualifies for the ballot regardless of if the party wants that to happen or not.
If she runs and makes the ballot - and 45k valid signatures is a pretty tough hurdle - it'll make things worse for Democrats, but definitely not guaranteeing a GOP pickup.
I mean there's definitely a chance, more-so than were this just a D vs. R race, but the one poll I saw on the matter (in fall 2021, when Dems were slumping in polls in general) had it as a 38R-36D race, with Sinema taking some portion of that remainder. A GOP lead, but not insurmountable by any means.
