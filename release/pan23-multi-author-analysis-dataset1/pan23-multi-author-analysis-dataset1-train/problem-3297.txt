During Hitler's up-and-coming years with the NSDAP, from 1925 to 1933, the general public certainly had mixed opinions on him. It is very true that some Germans who met him were almost instantaneously struck by his charisma. Of course, these persons were already predisposed to the core NSDAP beliefs. Others, both Germans and foreign journalists, thought of him as a laughing stock and a clown. The Weimar Republic was trying at being a modern, industrialized, liberal European nation; whereas Hitler on any given day might be seen in either military dress (not totally unusual for Great War veterans) or lederhosen (a little unusual outside of folk events; akin to an American unironically wearing something like a Revolutionary War uniform and expecting to be taken seriously).
How was research like this done? Both at the time and today (though because 20-year rule, asking about historians today looking at figures in the past).
fascinating! thanks for your time and effort. I'm currently reading through Shirer's "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich." Any opinions on this one? I'll definitely get started on your two references.
