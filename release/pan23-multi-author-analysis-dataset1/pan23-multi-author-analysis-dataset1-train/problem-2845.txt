When you and Gma go to the attorney (if she already has a will go back to the attorney that initially drew it up and registered it. He/she can add the addendums of change to the will. Also ask if it’s possible that Gma can sign over any real estate to you now with her keeping life long residency. That way if she declines and needs extensive care during her journey to the other side they can’t come after half the estate for her bills. It’s also better for her to transfer to you while alive and coherent. No one can argue she wasn’t of sound mind. Also ask the attorney if leaving the others $1 each takes the ability for them to contest away. NAL and not familiar with laws in GA but have been through some “learning experiences” in my state. Good luck.
All the advice is correct your grandmother needs to have an attorney create or modify the will for a bunch of reasons also listed, the attorney will specifically name and disinherit the other family members. The other reason is you want the attorney to store the will so snooping family members cant find it and take action, like browbeating grandma to void the will. Do not tell anyone in your family what grandma is doing or planning. They do not need to know.
