Something similar happened to my dad about a decade ago when he traveled to Micronesia. He was a scuba diver on a dive vacation with his friends, got a cough and went to the local hospital and they gave him prescription cough syrup. He took his dose as prescribed for days and we could hear him deteriorating over the phone. News broke while he was still taking it, a bunch of people in that village had died of poisoning, and he stopped. When he (barely) made it back to the states, it took months to recover. This likely contributed to his heart attack not long after.
Actually, it is relevant because A) Reddit is primarily a US based audience, and B) the goal of articles like these is to not only inform for to spur activism locally and act as a warning internationally (not just the USA but wherever the rightwing LowIQanon Putin stooges are resurgent).
Good, those sick fucks. I grew up in HK, and every week or so Iâ€™d hear on the news about some new, fake food: fake beef, fake egg, and guess what? Fake fucking rice RICE.
