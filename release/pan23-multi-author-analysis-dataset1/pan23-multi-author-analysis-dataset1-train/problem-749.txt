Considering what Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett have said, such an extreme decision looks very unlikely. I am not surprised in the slightest by that.
The preclearence provision of the voting rights act of 1965 was struck down under the reasoning "All this states with historically racist voting laws have been blocked from implementing new ones for so long, you can't prove that they are still racist" , can we revisit that case again with decade of race based gerrymandering cases as evidence?
Pfft. Even with the most extreme ruling possible, they are no longer in a strong enough position in state legislatures to overturn a Presidential election, and when you look at how their internal divisions are now starting to cost then control of legislative chambers even when they hold majorities of seats, I think their position will only weaken further.
What a POS court. I remember bitching to my colleagues last year about how the USSC has always been a hot garbage institution. How else can you explain the 100+ years it took them to decide that maybe black people are human and subject to human rights?
