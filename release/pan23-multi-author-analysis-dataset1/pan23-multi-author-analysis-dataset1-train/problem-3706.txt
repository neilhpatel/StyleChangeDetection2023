If you analyse the pattern, it really sounds like a desperate plea underneath... he's desperate for a "deal" where he looks like the winner, his life probably depends on it. We know he's talking shit when he says he's ready to negotiate...and I don't know, I got downvoted a lot, but my stance is that negotiations can't start until he pulls completely out of Ukraine...including Crimea, then we can talk.
But is that not the point, Putin says he is ready for negotiations as is quoted in the article, which is something he says.
"We are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions, but that is up to themâ€”we are not the ones refusing to negotiate, they are," Putin told Rossiya 1 state television in the interview.
But we all know he does not want to negotiate, and that's exactly why I quoted it...I know what his "negotiation" means and that's to accept his ultimatums which isn't negotiating at all.
Cool! Zelenski has always said that he was open to negotiations and that his terms where a complete pullout, a return of any annexed lands, and for them to pay for everything they have broken/killed.
