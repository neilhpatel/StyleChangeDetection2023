Economists are fairly well agreed that the fiscal spending of the New Deal didn't bring the USA out of the Great Depression for two reasons:
That’s absolutely brilliant! I’ll definitely look into the sources you linked. My only question is: are there any heterodox historians who credited the recovery to natural causes ie the natural return to trend of the economy?
I suppose - I think I was referring to the sort of narrative Steindl 2007 posits, of forces inherent in the economy raising productivity, and that seemed rather unclear wrt what forces he is alluding to when he describes “mean reversion” influences?
1. The New Deal spending was mostly matched by an increase in taxes, rather than being funded by deficits, so on Keynesian grounds we wouldn't expect the fiscal spending to have an impact. (Note, the 1930s were before modern statistical collections in the USA, so there is a bit of modelling involved, but work in the 1950s and 1970s estimated that in 1933 real GNP was $62.1 billion less than 1929, while the budget deficit was only $2b, and in 1935  it was a shortfall of $49.3 b versus a $5b deficit (Fishback, 2010, page 404 (20 in pdf) ). There was a sharp spike in the US federal deficit in 1936 - leading to an a $10.6b shortfall against a $7.5b deficit, but this period was brief, caused by paying a bonus to WWI Veterans, and then the government deficit fell as revenues started to come in from the Social Security Act of 1935.
There was a sharp, severe depression in the USA over 1937-38, and then suddenly output started rising quite sharply, and this was before the US government really ramped up spending for WWII. This is somewhat a mystery of economic history, there is some evidence that it was probably increasing productivity, but why did it start rising in the middle of 1938? No one has come up with a good explanation of this.
