So, if I'm reading this right, your parenting plan does not make accomodations for these events (not a long weekend, no accomodations for "special events")? If that's the case then it's your way, or the highway - sometimes being rigid with the plan is the only way to deal with uncooperative co-parents. If she wants a modification of the parenting plan to accommodate these situations, then she should file it with the courts so they can have a guideline in place. The best interest of your child, here, is to be well rested for school the next day. If you give her to mom saying bring her home a day early and she doesn't, it looks like she would be guilty of parenting time interference and you could take her to court again for the violation - so it's up to you. So if you allow mom to take her: Put it firmly in writing for when you're allowing this unscheduled time, knowing that mom may violate it and bring her back late - in which case you can either accept it as something that will happen or take her back to court for interfering with your parenting time - since your parenting time seems to be strictly to oversee her schooling.
Thank you. As much as I've tried to explain this to the mother, she refuses to understand and is still believes that because she's the mother, she should make all of the decisions (judge strongly reprimanded her in court for this behavior). Your reply puts it very clearly and reassures me that I have correct understanding of the CO.
