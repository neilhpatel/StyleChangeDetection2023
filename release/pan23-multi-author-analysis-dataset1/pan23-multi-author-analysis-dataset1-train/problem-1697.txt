The lithium we currently have access to will easily last us the next decades and due to technological progress we get access to more and more over this time. I get the feeling that you're mixing lithium and cobalt up again, because that's the problematic one - again. However, EV batteries with no cobalt whatsoever are already being developed to a point where it's just a question of a few years until they are market ready and the problem can be considered as pretty much solved. After that one the problem is going to be nickel, but again, there are already concepts for batteries without this one as well. The materials of old batteries are also being recycled and reused, that's simply not done very much yet because just mining the material is so very cheap right now, with increased adoption this balance will sooner or later shift the other way. Also, the lifetime of those batteries is increasing all the time, they already last up to 20 years and this number is going to keep increasing for a while. And once this lifetime is over, they aren't actually unusable, they simply lose a lot of capacity, meaning they can be used in other applications until they are finally recycled and thus the rare materials they contain used again.

TL;DR: Lithium's not a problem and the actual problematic materials are already being replaced by non-problematic ones.
I would argue they have neither. Most countries are kleptocracies. The UN is comprised of representatives of those criminal regimes. Functional nations based upon the rule of law are the rare exception.
