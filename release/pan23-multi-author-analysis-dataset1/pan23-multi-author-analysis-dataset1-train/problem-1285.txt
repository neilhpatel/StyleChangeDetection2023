In the early years of our fur trade the abandoned women and children would often become destitute and be reduced to begging for food at the trading posts. More often than not they were rejected by their own people after they were abandoned by their European husbands. Some of my journals written by the early fur traders share a common theme mentioning how the abandoned wife of one Gentleman or another had become reduced to prostitution. Rejected by their own families they resorted to their bodies to the voyageurs and junior officers in order to feed and clothe themselves and their children. When the men weren't interested in paying for their bodies the abandoned women resorted to begging at the trading posts. When George Simpson became the governor in charge of the Hudson's Bay Company's fur trade he made a rule that any man leaving his wives and children behind had a portion of his pension taken away which was used to provide for his family. One would like to think that this rule was brought forth by altruistic reasons, but sadly it was not. The frugal Scottish governor had simply determined that providing for the abandoned families was too great of a burden that reduced the Hudson's Bay Company's profits.
It did occur though. Pocahontas's second marriage was to an Englishman. One can find examples of Scottish traders marrying into various southeastern Native American tribes. Two of the main Creek military leaders during the Creek War were Peter McQueen and William Weatherford who had as much, or more, British ancestry as Native American.
