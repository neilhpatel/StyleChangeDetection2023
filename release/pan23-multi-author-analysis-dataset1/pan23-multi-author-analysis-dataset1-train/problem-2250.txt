But beyond that, i think the Democrats are in deep trouble. They lost the working class and poor, and are now becoming the moralist party of money, not unlike the Republicans from the 80's thru GWB.
And the only way they lose, is when the urban areas depress votes, and the working class side with the Republicans.
And that track record, of not losing the popular vote for more than 20 years, may come to an end, as they become the Republicans of the past, and party of the rich suburbs.
"If I had to place a bet, the next president will be GOP but it will because of anti-woke nonsense, boring ass democrat candidate, & low voter turn out. Not some left tilt".
Republicans cant win unless they go back to pre-tea party Republicanism, and they can't do that without losing all the die hard trump supporters and conspiracy theorists, which would likely hurt their overall bottom line for at least a few election cycles as they've lost the trust of minority and young voters. They really backed themselves into a corner with no easy way out. And by the time they get out boomers will be politically irrelevant and the overwhelmingly liberal millennials and gen Z will be the strongest force in US politics.
