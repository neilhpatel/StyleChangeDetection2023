That's what they've been trying to do, with limited success. One of the reasons for the limited success is the failure so far to secure and obtain communications with all the players in the Jan. 6 insurrection. In the case of taxes, limited cooperation has been obtained by limited grants of immunity in exchange for guilty pleas and lenient sentences. The problem with obtaining damning testimony against Trump is that people in the organization know he is rich, powerful and vindictive and turning on him entails life-long consequences. Whereas, unless there is a case against them, they can plead the fifth with no consequences. (Of course, expecting any kind of loyalty from Trump is demonstrably futile.).
- Trump's Assistant Attorney General, Jeffrey Clark, who Trump almost named the top law enforcement official in America had a search warrant executed by the FBI.
That's the key to it right there. Those who do not have a valid case against them are basically irrelevant or at least peripheral to charging Trump. (Some of those will come aboard if it seems he really is going down.).
