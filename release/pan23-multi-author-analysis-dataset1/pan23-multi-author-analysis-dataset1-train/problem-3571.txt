In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Agreed. What we're seeing now is more apt to Dr. Frankenstein grappling with the consequences of his own monsterous creation. Just as in the novel, both won't rest until they know the other is dead.
Republicans made it a point to elect inexperienced and uneducated legislators with extremist tendencies to "drain the swamp" only to engage in the highest degree of cronyism in our nation's history. They're on a self fulfilling prophecy of destroying the government through their inability to govern and deliberate sabotage of our institutions. The IRS didn't even finish the mandated audits of Trump because they only had one person on the case.
