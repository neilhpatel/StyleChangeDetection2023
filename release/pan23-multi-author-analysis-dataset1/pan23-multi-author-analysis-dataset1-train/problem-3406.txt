The Ottoman military’s general unit types show which armor types would be needed. Light cavalry azaps and Tartar horse archers rarely wore metal armor at all, relying on ambush and operational raids, not heavy cavalry charges with spear and shield. Volunteer jihadi bash bazouk fought in light armor and were preferably used for sieges. There were ‘heavy' cavalry cores of mounted sipahis from the Rumelian and Anatolian provinces, and a comparably small infantry core of janissaries. Neither generally opened the battle or fought in heavy steel plate, except Serbian and Hungarian levies of the Rumelian Balkan provinces who are reported to use West European armor. Surviving examples of Anatolian and Janissary armor show ornate, and quite effective use of lamellar, mirror plate pieces tied to cloth or chain mail, and of course, literary sources report heavy use of silk and cloth ‘armor’. The Janissaries appear to have placed a higher premium on defensive firepower and offensive courage than heavy, exhausting armor.
Interesting. In light of the comment how do you then see effectiveness of Polish heavy cavalry that was widely succesful against Ottoman/Tartar armies - the famous winged hussars - often against overwhelming odds? This success was repeated in multiple battles during 17th century with Vienna/Párkány being only two of the examples.
