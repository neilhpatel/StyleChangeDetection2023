One of the requirements of a contract is a "meeting of the minds." If both parties aren't agreeing to the same thing, then there's no contract.
The written agreement is not the whole contract, it's evidence of the terms of the contract. There could be terms of the contract that are not within the four corners of the written agreement. This is why written agreements often include a clause saying "this is the whole agreement between the parties, anything else must be in writing.".
Electronically, DocuSign may not recognize that is what occurred; so if you disagree with the comments, you should make clear to the other party that you don't accept the terms of their counter offer, and if they wish the benefits of the agreement, they need to sign the original offer without modification.
Ya that’s a good idea. They’ve honestly just been so awful and difficult and at this point I just want them to fo. I think I just signed because they have been so unresponsive and flakey and I need this over. Extortion and all.
