I think that before any extensive answer can be offered, we would need to establish precisely what part of the eighteenth century you are wanting to examine. A hundred years is a long time, and as u/Bodark43 alludes to, the perceptions of Scots Gaels by the general populace of London through that particular period of history were not static. Rather, those feelings likely would have largely aligned with what was being reported by the press, and would be further influenced by discussions in public spaces, whether that be workplaces or coffeehouses. Newspapers and magazines had various critical slants and agendas, of course, but for most of the century Scotland was very much a part of Britain, even if it tended to be considered 'North Britain' by a significant percentage of the London populace.
The costume laws changed. For about 35 years, after it was proscribed in 1746, what we'd think of now as Highland dress ( that had not had a very long tradition, it seems) was banned. Before then, it wasn't. That ban did not apply to the Highland regiments, like the Black Watch. It seems to have been a pretty effective ban there- few daring to wear kilts or belted plaid outside their homes. After James MacPherson kicked off what would be a Highland fad with his invention and publication of Ossian , in 1765, there would be greater use of Highland dress. That would increase enormously with the publication of Walter Scott's Waverly novels, which would result in quite an industry of creating Highland traditions after 1820, inventing clan tartans, increasing lenhs of beards, etc.
