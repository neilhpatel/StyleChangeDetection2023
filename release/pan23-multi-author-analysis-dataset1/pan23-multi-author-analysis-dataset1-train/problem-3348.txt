In Moore V Harper the counsel for NC had the audacity to say that allowing State Legislators to have sole discretion on districting could easily be stopped if it became abusive because, and I'm paraphrasing, congressional members, who have much more at stake than Senators, just this term passed a bill outlawing political gerrymandering in all 50 states.
Right. Even when the Court struck down large parts of the Voting Rights Act under their insane “states rights” theory, they suggested Congress could just fix the VRA to restore it effectively, knowing that wouldn’t happen. But we’re past though point anyway. If Congress today passed Obama’s promised codification of Roe, the Court would simply strike it down. The reasoning doesn’t matter. They’ll strike it down based on whatever reason they want to.
