It's pretty common in downtown Tampa and Miami, especially in public parking lots, street parking, etc. It's not quite a mainstream scam since it requires the scammer to do some legwork and there aren't many opportunities to pull it off outside of metropolitan areas, but the scammers are getting brave.
have you recorded the moment? if so you are in a good position to nullify the claim of speeding. In these type of cases, there is no certainty on whom the burden of proof lies upon, but I think you may also petition them and urge them to revisit their claim and if any discrepancies are spotted, you ought to file a case, so no innocent get to revisit the fate you are at, and make them upgrade their systems to not let it happen again.
This sounds like a scam. Call the courthouse or go online to city you got ticket to lookup citation. See if it exists. Do not use site listed on “ticket”.
Florida attorney. I’ve seen fake red light camera tickets and fake tickets emailed. I wouldn’t be surprised at the least if this is a fake ticket. How much is the ticket? How many digits is the traffic citation number? Real ones are usually 7 digits long, also speeds in excess of 30MPH above the posted limit require you to show up to court.
