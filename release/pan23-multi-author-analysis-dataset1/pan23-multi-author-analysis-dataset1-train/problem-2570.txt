Unfortunately, the officers are correct that homeless persons do tend to move around and disappear intentionally quite a bit. It doesn't mean they should not take locating this person more seriously, however finding this type of person can be quite difficult from a practical standpoint and a homeless person is less likely to have a lot of things generally used to track a person - vehicle, active cell phone, credit/debit cards, an employer.
I second the PI option. The police don't care about the homeless at all, in fact the view them as pests more than people. They're constantly shooing them out of places, knowing damned well they don't have any other place to go. A really good PI can do better work that the police, IMO. It's a great option if you have the money to throw at the problem, can give you a bit of peace of mind. The fact that you guys found her dog says a lot.
I didn't ask what happened in between her confrontation with the policy officer and the social worker locating her because it was an inappropriate time and not really my business.
Thanks for checking in. You are a true friend; she is lucky to have you in her life. So glad you found her (essentially) well, and glad you kept the pupper.
