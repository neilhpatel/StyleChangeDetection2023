Do you perhaps need to refresh yourself on the meaning of the word "more"? Or maybe we can skip that and you can just not be a facetious bore. Reddit abounds with examples of exactly what I'm talking about; young progressives writ large are eager to wipe their hands of religion and cede that ground to the right, despite the fact that exploiting religion has been a boon to conservatives for decades, and one for which the left has so far generally failed to formulate an effective response.
Agreed. Gay people don’t have a choice under Christianity but to live a life in the closet, or to live a double life. Most Christians are homophobic pieces of shit. Especially Catholics who pretend that their religion didn’t rape and murder millions of people in the name of God. I’ll be clear in that i believe in the faith that people have in Jesus, but I hate the institutions and I especially hate their hateful, mysoginistic and homophobic preaching. Gay people deserve better than to be a part of that bullshit. There are better ways of belonging in the world - of being a part of a civilized and inclusive society - which gives people a sense of meaning and fulfillment. Fellowship isn’t relegated to only the church with its typical hypocritical male at the pulpit.
