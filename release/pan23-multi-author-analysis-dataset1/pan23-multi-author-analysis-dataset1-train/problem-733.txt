First, as it notes, there were different stages of Estonia becoming independent, as 1990-1991 in the USSR was, to put it bluntly, a mess.
As for views on Soviet military service in Estonia post-independence, this I admit to being less familiar with, but it would be a bit complicated. While Estonia does view the Soviet administration and military as an illegal foreign occupation, viewing anyone who served in the Soviet military as some sort of collaborator seems impractical, given that until 1989 large numbers of Estonian men coming of age would have been conscripted into the Soviet military anyway. It does seem that a few former Soviet officers joined the Baltic militaries in the early 1990s, although these militaries were also basically created from scratch. In any case these militaries are tiny relative even to the Soviet forces that used to be stationed there - the Estonian Defense Forces today have about 6,500 active personnel, and at the time of independence that number was more like 1,000. In comparison, active Soviet military forces and their families in 1984 were estimated to be 10% of the republic's population - about 122,500 personnel, with families totaling some 148,000 in about 160 bases and garrisons (25,000 alone were in the Paldiski Submarine base, 20,000 in Tallinn and 9,000 in Tartu). Local agitation for the removal of Soviet forces from the republic's territory (plus massive Soviet military personnel and budget cuts) had already reduced that number to 50,000-60,000 by 1990. This dropped to 25-26,000 in 1992, 2,600-3,000 in 1993 and 1,600-2,000 by the final Russian military withdrawal in August 1994. By that time the bigger issue from the Estonian government's perspective were the circa 10,000 Soviet military pensioners in the republic. So in short yes, most former Soviet military officers in Estonia were viewed as a potential security threat, but a small number were instrumental in developing the new Estonian Defense Forces, so individual circumstances varied.
Edit - for this followup I found some useful info in Jussi Jauhiainen, "Militarisation, Demilitarisation and Re-use of Military Areas: The Case of Estonia", Geography, Vol. 82, No. 2 (April 1997), pp. 118-126.
An anectodal example of an Estonian officer during the restoration of independence was Ants Laaneots - an Estonian colonel in the Soviet army. Who resigned from Soviet army in september 1991 (he was already located on Estonian soil), becoming one of the founding officers of Estonian army, becoming the Chief of General Staff and later the Commander of the Defence Forces. Also becoming Estonian 4-star General (highest possible), only third ever after Johan Laidoner and Aleksander Einseln.
Anyway, on to the military side of the equation. From 1989, the Soviet military began to experience mass evasion to its semiannual conscription drives (if you got conscripted to the navy you had three years of service ahead of you - if to the army you faced two). The Caucasian and Baltic republics had the lowest turnouts, and Estonia often some of the quotas even among that: the spring 1989 call up saw Estonia meet 79.5% of its recruitment goal (the lowest in the USSR), spring 1990 saw only 40.2% of the recruitment goal met, and spring 1991 just around 30 percent. Estonians by and large were opting out of the Soviet Military when they could, and by late 1991 the Estonian government (along with the other Baltics) was calling for a Soviet military withdrawal from the republics' territories, which was achieved in 1994. Those Soviet military units that had remained in the Baltics from 1991 were integrated into the Russian military.
