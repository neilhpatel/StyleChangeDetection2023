My god. That website is garbage. Canâ€™t even see the damn article. They got me with the clickbait headline. But noped the hell out of there in about 7 seconds.

Right now Ukraine is devastating Russia's military capability. Despite the small amount of funding they are getting for weapons (let's be honest, its a drop in the pond for US military budget), the return the US is getting on this investment is incalculable. It will no longer take a staggering amount of money to protect US interests abroad from Russia now. Not only that, but with NATO getting new members, the US military/industrial complex stands to save even more money (because of the new members commitment).
