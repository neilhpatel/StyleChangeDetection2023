The Scandinavian centre of power was in medieval times clearly in Danish hands. The interactions with the other Scandinavian nations were diverse, but Norwegian and Swedish cultures were more peripheral until the Swedish crown got a very dominant role in the 16-17 century, were Swedish kings even ruled big regions of Northern Germany.
Also, there is a very strong influence of lower german into Scandinavian languages, especially Swedish. These influences were exerted through the Hanse as the economical powerhouse of Northern Europe that were linguistically lower German. These influences through trade were achieved through the Baltic sea, the medieval land routes were more dangerous and expensive, especially in the diverse political landscape of the northern German empire.
Thats not correct. The war of 1864 incorporated the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg into the German Confederation. The modern border is from 1920, when the Northern half of the Duchy of Schleswig was “reunified” with the rest of Denmark, after a referendum.
You’re welcome ) I’m in North Schleswig at the moment and it is the 100 year anniversary of the reunification. It might seem like a small border change in the grand scheme of things, but it is a big deal here.
