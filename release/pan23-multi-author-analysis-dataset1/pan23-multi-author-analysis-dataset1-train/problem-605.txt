Please what ever you do make a record of everything if you can record by camera do so but you need to put a stop to this behavior, he is taking advantage of you because you are young. No man should be entering your private space and a 24hr notice is a reasonable ask. Find a attorney that knows tenants right and get on this asap. And ask him for his work order.
That's nonsense they have to give a 24 hr verbal are hand written notice these landlords get confused once they rent out the apartment or house it is in your possession you have rights if your not confrontational next time he comes in play stupid call the cops tell them you hear an intruder are simply put a latch on your door ,you can't change the locks but he cant stop you from putting a heavy latch on if he would break that without reason and it would have to serious, he could be charged for breaking and entry he owns the building not you are your life.
Of course you are. Your landlord is a pervy creep. Please get a door wedge for your own safety. If you are able to afford to move, I would think about doing that. You should be able to enjoy safety and privacy in your home.
