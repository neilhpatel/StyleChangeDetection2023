Some areas are just…I don’t know., especially rural areas. They think it will affect others not them. They are also big into being oppressed by the “woke” people. They at least in my family don’t even know what it means but Desantis says they are bad so they gotta go. My sister in Jacksonville was telling me to stop buy Chaboni because they fired all the Americans in their company and hired only the Chinese illegals that snuck into the country . Wait what? And she doesn’t even have access to internet. People in her circle have been feeding her this. I’m in S Florida now but from N Florida.
That said, I still worry about things like the "independent state legislature doctrine" which the Supreme Court is overviewing into this summer, and if the House GOP majority (if it stays stable enough given everything that elected McCarthy and such) would gladly cause more chaos after the 2024 election should he or another GOP candidate lose.
Are you kidding?? Trump is chomping at the bit to get on the stage with him and say, "There would be no Ron DeSantis without Donald Trump!".
As a Florida resident this is terrifying, he’s sent his goons after officials that crossed him over Covid numbers, sent police to the homes of voters that were told they we okay to vote and had them arrested, dumped asylum seekers form another state, has teachers so afraid of being targeted they have removed all the books from their classrooms and removed elected officials and replaced them with his appointees. And so much more. The damage he would do at a National level would be horrific. What is most terrifying is that people think this is wonderful.
