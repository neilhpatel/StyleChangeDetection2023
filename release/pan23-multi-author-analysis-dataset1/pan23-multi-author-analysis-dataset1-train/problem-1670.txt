Arizona may be evenly split between R-D-I voters, but Sen. Sinema was elected as a progressive Democrat, and she has almost exclusively disappointed her supporters from the beginning of her term. The state has only increased its movement towards the Left since 2018; investments in the tech sector and increased housing costs nationwide continue to pull younger educated implants, but also repercussions from far Right policies set by State GOP leadership have pushed many centrists towards Progressive politics. Sinema has little chance of retaining backing from those on the Left, and any Republican support, she thinks she had, is from wealthy out of state donors, who cannot vote here. None of the conservative leaning voters will support any Independent over whatever this new Republican Party decides to nominate, with these growing demographic changes diluting their political power base, particularly since those who are less extreme will automatically support whoever is most likely to beat a Trumpy candidate. Kari Lake was a perfect example of this dynamic; with Katie Hobbs being such a weak candidate, Lake still lost. Another 2 years of these dynamics, including the largest international investment in AZ history for a new semiconductor plant, Gallego should be sitting pretty in 2024.
No. I'm tired of the endless election and fundraising cycle. People are constantly running for office and very little governing is being done. There are other factors that contribute to that, but it's to the detriment of all of us.
