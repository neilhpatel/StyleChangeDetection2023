It does not say "the employer can't have their own rules that comply with the mandate if they want to.".
If you asked for a religious or medical exemption and wrongfully were denied one this might implicate federal employment non-discrimination law. If you just don't wanna get the shot, you would not have a viable claim.
Edit: Nevermind. I just saw this: "This amendment specifies that a medicare certified provider or medicaid certified provider is not a private business or governmental entity, but only to the extent that the medicare certified provider or medicaid certified provider is subject to a valid and enforceable medicare or medicaid condition of participation that imposes a requirement contrary to the newly created Title 14.".
The court cases regarding the mandates affect your employer, in that they may not want to have a vaccination policy and if the mandates are ultimately invalidated in court, they may not have to. However, your employer is always free to have more restrictive rules than the minimum required by laws and regulations.
