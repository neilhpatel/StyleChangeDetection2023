I'd especially like to compare that to the '16 election. Billionaires, and their business interests like stability and predictability.
As I watch the news this afternoon about right wing Jan 6, treason. All the FBI had to do is asked the people involved and I guaranteed you FOX right wing propaganda that began in 1997 had a LOT to do with their treason. Heck, if you think Germans are smart, then Why they followed a loser in 1937? - Propaganda!
I’ve had to write off the Fox News watching people in my life. Life’s too short to deal with that level of dipshittery. Family, friends, coworkers and neighbors. I’m polite but not going to engage. My mental health and enjoyment of life is so much better.
There's a world of difference between an influential cable network, which also happens to be the most watched network in the country, knowingly spreading bullshit and trying to rile people up for political purposes, versus poorly researched reporting from a website that doesn't in any comparable way represent the left.
Trump was nothing but chaos. I can forgive people for '16 since it was talk without any history of any political action. I suspect that much of the wealthy temporarily jumped ship for a more stable candidate, even if that candidate was, maybe, a little more hostile to them.
