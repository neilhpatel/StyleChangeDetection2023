Unfortunately, the clerks office told me that it has to be the original officiant who does the edit. Since I’ve already got a “legally binding” document in the system, I cannot start a new one... but they still won’t tell me or give proof that I am, in fact, married. It’s all very strange.
So you want to go there ideally in person if that is an option and safe to do so in the current COVID environment (it is harder to ignore someone in person) and ask very specifically "The officiant has not responded to X attempts to contact them and we have no way to get them to do it. How do we get this fixed without them so our marriage is properly recognized legally and you are able to give us the documentation we urgently need?" Make clear that you are willing to do anything including doing the ceremony/fees etc. again, but you need a solid answer on what you need to do.
Was your officiant religiously affiliated? If so, you might want to reach out to the religious body who oversees all the clergypeople of that faith in your area (for example, if it was a Catholic priest, you'd want to get in touch with the area diocese) about the ghosting. Might spur some action.
