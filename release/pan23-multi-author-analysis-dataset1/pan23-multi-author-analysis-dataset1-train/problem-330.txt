Personal surnames and nicknames weren't restricted to kings, but were endorsed by the whole Frankish aristocracy (given for themselves, or attributed by their contemporaneous, or later, biographers).
How's that? How important was hairstyle in that time and why? Was this something special of the Frankish culture?
It was prevalent to the point Barbarian law codes had punishments for those who attacked someone by pulling their hairs, cutting them or even merely threatening to do so with these offences being comparable to a public humiliation or a mutilation which there were socially : for Franks or Goths (even living together with Romans), it meant having their identity and social status as freemen attacked and potentially likened to those of a lower status, a clergyman or even a shaved slave (whose appearance was so markedly that of a non-freeman than shaving the head of a slave one didn't possess was enough to not send the slave to their original masters but to give a monetary compensation instead).
Yes, that's what I was getting at. In English, surname generally implies heritability; so the phrase 'personal surname' is a bit confusing. A Roman nomen such as Julius, then, would count as a surname; but a name like 'the Bald' would seem to be more of a 'nickname'.

Maybe "epithet" or "byname" would have more useful connotations than "surname" in this context, given that surnames implies inheritability to a modern audience while epithets and bynames aren't necessarily inherited.
