“I woke up this morning… and I saw a story about this doctor, Dr. Braid,” Stilley said after he read Braid’s op-ed. “He’s obviously a man of principle and courage and it just made me mad to see the trick bag they put him in and I just decided: I’m going to file a lawsuit. We’re going to get an answer, I want to see what the law is.”.

Standing requires three elements: injury, causation, and redressability. The plaintiffs have to show they were “injured” by the doctor performing the abortion- this is already an issue, how is a random citizen harmed by a doctor performing an abortion? The easiest and most common injury is financial, but again, how do you show financial harm by a doctor performing an abortion?
They have to further prove that the doctor caused the “harm” or “injury” against the plaintiff by performing the abortion, that is, that the abortion directly caused the harm.
