When they show back up, simply say that you're no longer accepting their mail and they are responsible for submitting a change of address. Leave it at that. Do not engage them further.
I still get junk mail with their name on it, I presume because the post office doesnâ€™t bother looking at the name on the junk stuff and it all just makes it through (mostly credit card offers) but it cut down on a LOT of their mail I was getting.
1. Return each and every piece of mail (unless it's junk like coupons etc), write "Not at this address" on every piece, use a black sharpie, and cross out the barcode on the bottom as well. Some ex-mailcarriers do not support this, but I can't find any official USPS statement that would lead me to believe this is 'defacing' or 'altering' or 'tampering with the mail', other than forcing a real human to look at the mail, vs being re-routed automatically to your house based on the barcode.
I've been dealing with this for 4 years. The previous owner put out a change of address when he moved, but I get a couple pieces of mail a week. We mark return to sender on all of it and drop off a pile at the post office about every 3 months. I've spoken with the previous home owner about it and he said he'll change his address on all his accounts about 6 months after he moved. I wish I could just toss it all but that's illegal.
