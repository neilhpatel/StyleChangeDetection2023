BUT DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, ADMIT THE DEBT. If you admit the debt, pay even partially, or otherwise acknowledge the obligation, the statute of limitations period could restart and you'd be screwed. Best is to get a local lawyer to review and be "prepared" incase they file an action against you. Second best option if you do not want to consult with a lawyer is to ignore it. Do not have any communications with these folks from the debt collection agency. Do not even confirm you were at the facility. Nothing. Play dumb.
As far as stopping them from calling, in the US, right now the law specifies they cannot call "with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass", and intent is difficult to establish with a large corporation. You can request all communications be done in writing by mailing the collection firm, and they will have to stop calling, or send a cease and desist which would block the firm from contacting you at all with a few exceptions (including suing them for the debt).
Thatâ€™s very interesting! I am not so much motivated by the prospect of collecting, as I am the thought of sticking it to a company that is using underhanded tactics to make a buck for themselves.
