Get help researching the requirements for your state, but it generally doesn't have to be physical abuse. Abuse can be broad, and consistent verbal threats of physical abuse is a huge outlier. I went through this emotionally watching my mother be threatened with physical retaliation. I was convinced out of desperation( these situations can make you freeze in fear of the possibilities) to at the minimum call the state bar association. I luckily talked with someone who not only gave me a recommendation, but who referenced people to me who would take back pay. We were able to resolve the situation, and the lawyer ended up doing it pro Bono, despite me trying to give him my skimmed / saved money. There is always a way. Stay strong and hang in there.
NAL but two thoughts: (1) your boyfriend could explore getting a restraining order against your dad based on the security footage of the threatened violence, and (2) let your mom know you’ll readily be a witness to your father’s threats to make a false report to elder services. If your boyfriend was also a witness that may help as well.
Interesting. So he is never ACTUALLY physically abusive, just makes a lot of empty threats trying to act like a tough guy. But he is extremely emotionally abusive and manipulative. what would be considered "abuse" that I would be able to file a restraining order?
