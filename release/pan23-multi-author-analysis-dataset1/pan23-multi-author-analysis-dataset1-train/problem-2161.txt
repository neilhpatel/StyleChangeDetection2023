Trump's authority to declassify is completely irrelevant. They knowingly took things he wasn't allowed to have, ignored multiple requests to return them, and repeatedly lied to investigators about what they had and what they returned. Investigators and archivists bent over backwards to accommodate Trump and his lawyers, and they still managed to completely avoid doing the right thing.
