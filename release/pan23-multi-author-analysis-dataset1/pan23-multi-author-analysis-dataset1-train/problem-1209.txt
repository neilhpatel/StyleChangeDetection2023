/u/Zooasaurus and I talk about two different eras--19th century and Middle Ages--in . I'll c-p mine here, but you really should check out theirs as well!
The Qing did actually use such a system for regulating mercantile traffic in Xinjiang and Mongolia, regardless of origin – Han Chinese, Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, and even Turkestanis who wished to trade outside the karun boundary of their home city – were all required to obtain passes. Merchants applied for lupiao (literally 'road tickets') which would list the size of a party, the names, places of origin, age and distinguishing features of its members, and the goods and itinerary of the caravan – this could be updated at offices on the route if necessary, e.g. to take account of changes in planned route. A key piece of evidence in busting the infamous Gao Pu jade smuggling ring in 1778 came in the form of a pass to Hami which was discovered on two merchants in Shanxi, back in China proper, after a rather odd journey involving repeatedly swapping passes in such a way that they pretended to be making short hops, but were in fact covering vast distances.

Reading the book, I sort of had the impression that Hermes strove for "Ifranjism" because he had to tack on A Thesis to a really fascinating exploration of medieval Arab Muslims' writing on Christian Europeans. It's definitely a political stance, too--an assertion of the power of a culture that was/is Orientalized, and a demonstration of the ubiquity and timeless of the need to exoticize the Other.
