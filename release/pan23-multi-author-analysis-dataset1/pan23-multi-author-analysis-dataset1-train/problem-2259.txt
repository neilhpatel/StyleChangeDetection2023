Depending on the municipality, you may be call them and talk to them. They may waive the fine if you are polite, ask for clarification, provide clarification on your shelter, and "apologize" for the "error" you may (or may not) have made. As they say, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar.
The fine 642$ when I called to contest the clerk had told me I had to plead not guilty next week at a zoom with a judge then later appear in court to prove my case with im assuming the officer there i read theres a chance he doesnt appear case is dropped but I'm worried I dont have enough to drop this in my favor.
Also, research the letter of the law. Does it specify what constitutes a "tent" or "camping"? The exact law is probably cited on the ticket. Look it up and read it carefully.
im pretty sure I'll end up paying then put on my record then the insurance going up if all fails I just don't get how others I witness had actual camping tents on the beach get away with it while I stand there ready to leave with a beach shade behind my truck its not like they were closing the gates or anything.
How much is the fine? How far away is the court? Is there an available procedure for contesting the ticket by mail?
