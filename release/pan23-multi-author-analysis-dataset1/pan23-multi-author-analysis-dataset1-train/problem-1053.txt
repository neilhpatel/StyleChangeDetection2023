Hurts my stomach to think that this might be the case but given that we in other countries, namely many people in Iransâ€™ favorite one-sided rival the US, are discussing this and feeling a personal connection to him because of it kind of points to the opposite.
Horrible. Even worse to me is the people that set themselves on fire in protest. Ever seen someone burn to death, I have, I can't even fathom that level of pain.
I don't doubt there is some level of involvement from the CIA, probably leaning heavily on Mossad's shocking level of penetration of Iran, because the US lost most of its most valuable agents in Iran a few years back when Iranian intelligence discovered the CIA was using a single-purpose software to communicate with its agents that could easily identify anyone who had it installed as a mole. But given the timing (almost two years into the endless rounds of JCPOA revival talks), and given the obvious implications of these protests for any political viability of reviving the now-dead-and-buried JCPOA, the timing certainly isn't particularly convenient for the US intel community, which ultimately is more worried about nuclear implications than Iranian domestic oppression.
Nice write up. I will add that there is a large portion of us too who despise our current support for Israel and the apartheid their government imposes.
