This. While it's ok to pick a side, it's important to remain objective and skeptical about what you see in the media. Everything the west sees is designed to make it seem like Ukraine is winning hard, and vice versa for Russia. It's hard to know what is accurate and what isn't.
While we may wish it were true, we don't really know if that's entirely accurate. Western media loves to depict Russia as terribly under geared and while that may be true to some extent, I'd be shocked if Russia, a place with extreme cold weather, didn't have the supplies to keep their soldiers alive in snow. They are one of the highest spenders globally on their military so they must have something.
