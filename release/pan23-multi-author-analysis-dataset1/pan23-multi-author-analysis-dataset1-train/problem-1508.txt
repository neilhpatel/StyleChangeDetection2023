Hahahaha now that you have pocketed the milions now it's a" mistake". Typicall european hypocrisy. Just like when they colonized Africa and then were like why do we have these berbers around, why don't they adjust lol And later supported the inavsion of Iraq to suck american dick and then wonder why do we have Muhamed in Camden Town. And fucked up Libiya and then complained about muslims refugees from Lybia and Morocco nv of course people will take advantageof the situaiton. Or when they say we need more workers from Balkan, but we don't want their culture. Or when they needed Turks for various shit, but then said they will never join the EU. It's like make a stand, will you bear the consequences of your actions or won't you? One ass multiple chairs. And now the extreme religious conservatives are winning more and more elections in EU. So take their money and make them not be able to live where they are then kill them.The problem is that the europan elites want the money and their people don't want to live next to the people the elites are forcing to move to a place where there is stability. This will cause a bloodbath in Europe one day.
It is estimated that more than 6500 migrant workers have died and above 10000 have been injured in such a way that they cannot work anymore, It will be a reality check for most of the people to see and we will probably see the reality of Hipocrite celebs and politicians by keeping a close watch on who is visiting this WC and praising qatar.
I hear you. Personally I think you have to take each choice as it comes and do your best to side with people or causes who need your help and support. Thatâ€™s all you can do.
