Israel is not the first country to have potentially killed a journalist via sniper, but somehow, I don't recall too many people speaking up about any other sniper killed journalist.
The article also refers to the Israeli army saying it was likely one of its soldiers that shot the journalist accidentally. I would call that an investigation.
Let's be honest here, if Israel had any single piece of evidence that would point to another probable killer or that would give credibility to their claim of palestinian militant suddenly showing up and leaving that only they saw and didn't show in video they (and you) would be quite loud about it, but the fact that we only have "we investigated ourselves and found ourselves innocent, trust us" tells us all we need to know about who killed Abu Akleh.
Yup. And it was funny seeing people talk about it after they had already decided before any information was out there that Israel had deliberately targeted her.
Yes. Though one could agrue that it might be useful for other Palestinian cases against Israel in the ICC.
