Not all archaeological sites are deeply buried. Often they're just under the surface. However, the well preserved remains tend to be deeply buried as these are less effected by the processes that disturb the soil (for example cultivation, plant roots, burrowing animals, getting churned up by freeze- thaw cycles).
I hope it's okay to ask a follow-up. I'd like to know, are there any academic meta studies which examine as it pertains to the proportion of ruins which are found burried and the relative state of preservation? None of the answers here seem to address the issue of how the burial of a civilization's remnants might be influencing the odds of those remnants remaining untouched for modern archaeologists to find. Is this a topic of much research? Have any proxy studies been attempted? I'm probably using the wrong vocabulary to query Google Scholar, hence why I'm not finding any papers on the subject. Cheers.
- Organic deposition. This happens in places where soil conditions mean organic matter doesn't decompose and peat forms. Tends to be happen in wet climates.
One final element that contributed was the repeated barbarian invasions mentioned above- during which times a great amount of vandalism occurred, where many of the municipal functions of the city were purposefully damaged including broken aqueducts and clogged sewers, a few years ago they found a statues head blocking one of the ancient Roman sewers:
