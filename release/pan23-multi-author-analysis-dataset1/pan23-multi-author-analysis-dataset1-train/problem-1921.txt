The key factor in your favor is that the company didn’t follow its own policies and procedures when they fired you and they did so based only on hearsay. You have a reasonably strong wrongful termination case and they know it. A good employment attorney should be able to use this leverage to negotiate a favorable employment severance agreement which contains a confidentiality clause to protect you from being blackballed by a negative employment reference when you move on.

Your post does not appear to contain an answerable question. Please see for examples of questions that we cannot answer.
The company is trying to do three things here - (1) neutralize your wrongful termination evidence by offering a frankly meaningless “rehire” for a written admission of fault; (2) make it clear that the rehire is merely a legal construct to protect the company from liability and that you should quit ASAP before the company fires you again (which they will at the first available opportunity); and (3) sufficiently punish you to placate your boss, allow him and the company to save face & deter other employees from criticizing management going forward. You’re essentially being reduced to a cautionary tale.
