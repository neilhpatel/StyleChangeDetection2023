The civil war ended in Khmer Rouge victory in 1975. The Khmer Rouge leadership was visionary - insanely so. They sought to build a purified Cambodia, free from foreign influence, remaking society from the ground up. Their plan: Cambodia would become a perfect communist agrarian society. Targets: any supporters of the former government, anybody contaminated by foreign ideas, intellectuals, the educated, monks, Moslems, Christians, ethnic minorities (the Khmer Rouge legally abolished about 20 ethnic groups, about 15% of the population, and worked towards killing them). Victims were used for forced labour, with many dying of starvation or disease. Over a million were executed. The regime brutally purged its own ranks.
While different parts (zones) of the new country, called 'Democratic Kampuchea' (DK) suffered to different extents in this period, by 1979, all who lived through this trauma would report forms of extra-judicial killings for infractions against the state, the split between those members of society who lived in urban areas prior to the revolution ('new people' / 'April 17 people' as opposed to 'old' or 'base' people) and depravations resulting from lack of food in relation to the work that was expected of them. Certain ethnic and religious groups were also explicitly targeted by the regime, such as the Muslim Cham peoples and ethnic Vietnamese.
