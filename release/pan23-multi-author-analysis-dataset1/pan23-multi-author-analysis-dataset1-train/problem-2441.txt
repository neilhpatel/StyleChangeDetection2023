There are still many countries outside of the G7 and Europe that require Russian oil and won't be able to buy more expensive oil. Currently, benchmark Brent crude is trading at about $86. If the price cap was set at 30 like Poland suggested, Russia would probably stop exporting oil driving up prices even further and leave many countries without oil. The idea behind the oil cap is also to either force Russia to sell oil at a minimal profit or have them waste ressources on building their own shipping and insurance evosystem.
No? The thing is global oil supply is fixed and can't be changed easily, meaning countries can't just start pumping more oil when they wish and global oil demand is also inelastic. Now with many countries going into recession the demand would decrease a bit but if Russian oil is no longer in the market then demand would still outstrip supply. Meaning even in an global economic slowdown oil prices would still increase and this would be disastrous for countries, especially for poor countries many of whom will collapse and will lead to huge suffering.
