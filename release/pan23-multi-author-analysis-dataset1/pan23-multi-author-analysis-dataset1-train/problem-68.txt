Uniforms in the UK are so expensive. It cost my family £100s to buy all my kit at the start of Year 7 (shirts, trousers, jumpers, blazer, PE top, PE trousers, PE socks, other PE socks (had to wear a different style for certain sports) PE jacket, shin guards, mouth guard, hockey boots, trainers, something else that I probably forgot). And this was about 10 years ago, when £500 was worth more. This was all compulsory for us to buy.
