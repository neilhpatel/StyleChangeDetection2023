I used to work with classified document security. Believe it or not, breaches happen more frequently than you'd like to think. Usually, they don't amount to anything, and initial offenders usually just get reprimanded. Repeat offenders, or offenders that don't cooperate with security, will be charged and held accountable according to the level of classification of materials left unsecured. This includes revocation of security clearance, heavy fines, and prison sentences.
Exactly. The issue with Trump wasn't that he had the materials, it's that he refused to return them. This is literally Biden doing the right thing when no one was even looking. But they'll fucking impeach him anyway because they are God damn traitors.
Seriously. The chucklefucks in r/conservative are all like "i wonder what the "Dems" have to say about this one". We think mishandling of classified information should be investigated? Are they admitting it's a crime now? The left's stance on investigations into this kind of thing hasn't changed between biden and trump.
Absolutely correct! I don't care if it is Trump or Biden or whoever, classified docs reside with an authorized custodian. You have to have a good reason to sign them out, and you have to return them to the custodian as soon as you are done with them. The DOJ needs to determine what the hell happened in all of these cases where the procedure wasn't followed.
