I have heard a story that word filtered through the Navy shops on how to fix the problem, and they started altering the torpedos. News of this got back to the torpedo factory, and they started sending out their torpedos with seals and special paint, to make it obvious when someone had altered them and discourage it. Word then filtered through the Navy shops on how to remove and replace the seals and how to fake the paint. Like many wartime stories, this one seems too much fun to be true. I would be curious if you could confirm, deny, or point me towards a source.
A great story from this era is when the legendary commander of SubRon 2, Swede Momsen, got word from his captains that it wasn't them but the torpedoes that were the problem, he put his life on the line to find out since his word carried weight with the brass - he basically had pioneered deep sea diving and conducted the first successful sub rescue in history, and after the war he was largely responsible for the design of the first nuclear submarine.
