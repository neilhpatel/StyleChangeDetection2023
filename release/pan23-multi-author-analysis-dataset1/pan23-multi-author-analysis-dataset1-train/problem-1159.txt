Railroad gauge was definitely something of an issue for the Soviets, although hardly one that was insurmountable, as the end result of the war would indicate. For reasons that a railroad historian can go into more depth than is necessary for the question itself, while Europe mostly standardized to a track gauge of 1,435 mm, the Soviet railroads ran on a wider 1,520 mm gauge.
Crossing into territory where the railroads were designed for European gauge though, things became much more problematic. Aside from the general weakening that the ties experienced due to the holes already present, the ties often just weren't wide enough! Regauging the rails thus often required a considerably lenhier and harder process, the lines essentially needing to be deconstructed, and rebuilt with new ties. The Soviets weren't alien to this need, having already established whole brigades to follow in the rear of the advancing armies given the German proclivities to destroy tracks as they retreated, but building new track was generally tougher than repairing, and the speed of Soviet advances later in the war often meant the Germans were unable to complete the task.
