Finally for this post, the US and UK working together is core to the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). As I noted elsewhere a few weeks ago, Timothy Sayle's recent book Enduring Alliance: A History of NATO and the Postwar Global Order (which is very good, by the way), he argues that - certainly in the early days - NATO's primary mission, was not military containment of the USSR (i.e.: preventing an invasion into Western Europe), but to resist Soviet political blackmail over issues such as Germany, something that Washinon and London were jointly concerned about. Moreover, Sayle contends that NATO (at this early stage) was as much a tool to reassure domestic audiences in Europe (including the UK) as it was a means of resisting perceived Soviet adventurism. Finally, it also existed to provide a framework through which a rebuilt West Germany could be safely further integrated into Western politico-military structures without causing undue alarm amongst those populations who had so recently experienced the events of 1939-45 (the UK being key here).
Hi, can you elaborate on this? My understanding is that Wilson was notably known for his hostility to colonialism and imperialism, and that this was a central tenet of his (and more broadly the Democrats') position in 1912. Certainly his election was well received in Philippine nationalist circles.
