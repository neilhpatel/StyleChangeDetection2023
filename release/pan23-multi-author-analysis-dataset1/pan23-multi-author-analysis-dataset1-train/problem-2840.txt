Especially for its earliest incarnation, it’s fairly difficult to truly know what the “end-goal” of the adherents of the White Lotus would have looked like. Not only was it, well, a secret-society (which didn’t tend to circulate a whole lot of newsletters), and not only was it and it teachings actively suppressed by the Yuan and then Ming governments… but it likewise didn’t tend to get anywhere near whatever its goal “was” before being defeated and/or subsumed by competing monarchical movements (such as the Ming founder, Zhu Yuanzhang).
Thanks—this is all fascinating! I never realized Manichaean influence penetrated that far into China proper. One other thing you said struck me:
I’m likewise tempted to get in to the Taiping Rebellion and “Heavenly King” Hong Xiuqian’s attempt to carve out a divine thearchy of “God Believers,” with the wide backing of the oppressed Hokkien minority of the southeast coasts (another movement that the CPC has “claimed” as a proto-communist movement, in spite of Karl Marx’s own refutations of that (though, admittedly, his opinion was based on just pure orientalist racism than anything))… but honestly, someone else like probably /u/EnclavedMicrostate could do that better justice than me, so I’ll leave that to them.
