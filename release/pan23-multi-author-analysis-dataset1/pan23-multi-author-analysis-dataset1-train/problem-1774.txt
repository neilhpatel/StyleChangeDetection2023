Seriously, just ask him to not come back and don't explain or debate. I've had to do this with "service" animals because of excessive barking. It was pretty nuts and they didn't give a damn. Not my call on if it's a service animal or not but the next time they came I asked them to leave. They tried to threaten legal action and got all sorts of intimating. I simply kept repeating that they were not allowed at this establishment anymore. You could tell it got under the husband's skin that he couldn't bait me into a lawsuit. Autism isn't your problem. Your problem is a bad patron who needs to not come back.
Harassing people isnt a disability. You are barring him from your establishment for harassing an employee not for being autistic. There is a huge difference.
Only a discrimination to be contrary to the law it must be based solely on protected status; this can be direct "i hate black people", or by strict categorical inference "all of 'them' are lazy"; but discrimination based on a specific act or pattern of behavior "this guy is sexually harassing my worker" is not protected.
