The loan payment letter came to my wife and I's name so I assume she transfered the property to our name and forged my parents signatures at that point but again still in the dark a bit.
As for as how she was able to get around my parents having to sign is she has now admitted to transfering the property into mine and her name and forged my parents signatures for that process or forged their signatures on the loan itself.
My advice? Get all the documentation together that you can - get your credit reports, your parents credit reports, a current copy of the deed. Contact the Bank and the County Clerk. If what you learn corroborates what she is telling you, than I would contact a divorce lawyer immediately. And personally? I would go straight to the police. Not just about her, but about the others who helped facilitate the fraud - they could be doing it to other people too.
Not necessarily. You didn't engage in the fraud (though there is the potential argument that you may have benefited from the proceeds). Definitely discuss this with an attorney.
