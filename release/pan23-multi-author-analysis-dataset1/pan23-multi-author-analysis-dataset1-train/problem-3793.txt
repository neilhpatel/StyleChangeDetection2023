Having said that, taking away tax benefits and child subsidies is counter-productive as mentioned above. Those benefits actually reduce the birth rate because they help keep parents out of poverty.
The problem is a lot of people advocate the use of poverty itself as a means to reduce the birth rate (I am looking at you Malthus). This may be evil or not, but more importantly it is just disastrously wrong. Increasing poverty will have the opposite effect. The same type of person often also advocates or implies the use of genocide, war and disease as a means for reducing world population, all of which will also be counter-productive in the long term, and are also pretty evil.
What they just noticed? Corps have been bulldozing the planet for over a century. Some shits going to go down... either some draconian restrictions to allow ecosystems to heal, or human civilization.
corporations? the recycle guy at the center in Snellville, GA told me to buy a bag of kittie litter and pour the used anti-freeze in the bag and throw it in the trash...
