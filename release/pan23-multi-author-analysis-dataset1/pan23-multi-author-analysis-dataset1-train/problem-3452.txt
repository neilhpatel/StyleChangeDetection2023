Absolutely. Better yet, not even participate in the first place. Our team is at the World Cup every time, it wouldn’t hurt to sit this one out to send a strong message.
Hahahahaha. For real. I get that this is your chance to make a statement and all, but you gotta get your head on the match. Do this in the interim between matches if that’s your pleasure, but get you’re head in the game.
Qatar is a authoritarian, human rights violating, jihad propagating regime. But even there, these players will face less repurcussions than what BLM supporting players faced. Time to reflect?
I find it hilarious that so many western and European countries are finding it within themselves to care about human rights issues in Qatar after turning a blind eye to decades of colonizing, instigating wars, etc themselves. Truly amazing.
I am commenting on the duplicity of the reaction that almost half of the US population had when players took a knee in support of BLM or when the president of the United States, who is supposed to be the leader of the free world demanded that the players taking the knew should be fired, or when kaepernick remained an unsigned player for a season or two.
