I'm just curious about the restraining order. If the neighbors' house is adjacent, how can you get a restraining order? I mean if the asshole neighbor is standing, say, 30 feet away from OP's parents because he/she is technically on their property, how can you enforce something like this? Thank you.
Your parents should put together a short letter attaching or at least referencing the previous survey they had done, and clearly stating that they object to their neighbors' fence efforts because the fence extends onto your parents' property. It should also ask the neighbors to hold off on starting work on the fence until the issue is cleared up. That will show that your parents tried a conciliatory, problem-solving approach, rather than threatening the neighbors with a lawsuit. Take the high road, always, and show that your parents are being the reasonable ones. (Plus, you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar, and even if your parents don't persuade the neighbors to slow down, it will be more persuasive with the judge or the neighbors' lawyer or the building department or whomever else might later become involved.).
While the advice to get a real estate attorney is spot on, I'd also consider sending them a registered letter with a copy of the survey noting they appear to be building on your property and if so action will be taken to require them to remove it.
1. If the City has any ordinance they might be violating, work with the city. Maybe they need a license or permit to build a fence?
