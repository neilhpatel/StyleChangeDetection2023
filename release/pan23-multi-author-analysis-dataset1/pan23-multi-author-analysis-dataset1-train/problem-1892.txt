I hate Trump... but... if they want to do this everyone in the government needs to at minimum be expected to drop their taxes. This will forever be politically motivated until it's not when everyone agrees to drop their taxes. This is a game to Trump make him make the next move. "Oh look all of congress dropped their taxes except the impeached president..." however this will literally never happen with the gop or dnc both of them have shit to hide in their and it will make them look real shitty when they pay less in taxes than the vast majority of their constituents. Now obviously there are some legit people in power... however I don't believe for even .1 of a second that the vast majority of them are using legal albeit shitty loop holes. I mean why wouldn't you who doesn't try and get the most from taxes, I mean I actually like the idea of taxes, I find it fundamental to making a better society but even I try and get them down...

Siding with Trump's arguments would harm the constitutional authority of a co-equal branch of government "by in effect preventing Congress from completing any investigation involving a former president whenever there are allegations that the investigation was politically motivated," the committee said in its filing.
