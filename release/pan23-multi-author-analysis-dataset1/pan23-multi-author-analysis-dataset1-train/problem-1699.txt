If you were 20 and they were 16 that is statutory rape. You should consult a criminal defence lawyer, not knowing their age is not a defence.
They held this over my head for years if I didn't play ball or listen to what they said they would threaten this on me they would get me to pay them over half my paychecks to the point where I'd have just 200 bucks for every two weeks and if I tried to stand up they were quick to knock me back down they made me do all sorts of stuff around their house is Free Labor all the time they told me one day that they wanted me to fight for custody then the next they threatened me not to fight for custody these people were crazy I've had an attempted kidnapping where they have had multiple people jump out around the car trying to take my son I had to wrestle him off of a motorcycle they maced inside the car and it got crazy they planted GPS tracking devices on my car they planted drugs on my car and called the police they've called CPS so many times that CPS already know what was going on before they even get there and all of them were not found it or ruled out I promise this is just the tip of the iceberg it sounds Petty but I promise it's big.
The attorney you spoke with. Yes, you broke the law. Yes, this is being done maliciously. The two things can both be true. You absolutely want to avoid any sort of criminal charge or especially conviction. Keep speaking with your attorney. Come up with a plan that protects you and your child. Good luck.
That it might not be statutory rape, because the 16 year old might (depending on the state) legally have sex with anyone of any age barring teachers or other people in positions of power. So the entire top half of your comment doesnâ€™t apply depending on state.
