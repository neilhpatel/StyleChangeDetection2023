Probably not, if you think of capitalism as a system. There were people who were behaving in the ways that modern capitalists do, but they did not constitute the dominant strata of society and they did not dictate the fundamental questions of the distribution of power and resources. And probably they could not exist, capitalism as a modern system requires a lot up front, in terms of state capacity, legal systems, standardization, and probably technology in order to operate. Going back to Rome, this is more or less the argument that Dennis Kehoe has made: Roman elites certainly had the inclination to make profit and investments, but ultimately they were constrained by the nature of their circumstances. This is, if it is not already clear, more or less my perspective: there was much of what is called in Chinese scholarship "sprouts of capitalism", such as wage labor in cities and the countryside, a vibrant array of investment opportunities, a string monetary system, productive improvements through technology, even something of a middle class etc, but there was no joint-stock company, no Board of Trade or Chamber of Commerce, no nabobs of the East Mediterranean Company.
