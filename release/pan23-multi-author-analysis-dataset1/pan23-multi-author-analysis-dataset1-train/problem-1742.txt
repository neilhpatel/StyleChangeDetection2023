The fact that a lot of the Einsatzgruppen commanders had PhDs is representative of a larger pattern within the SS leadership or more specifically the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) leadership.
The RSHA was one of several – and next to the Economic and Adminsitrative Main Office (WVHA), which was responsible for the administration of the Concentration camps – arguably most important SS main office, meaning the central adminsitrative structure of the SS and its state within a state. The RSHA was designed to be largely responsible for security matters. That included, among other things, being the highest adminsitration for both the Security Police, which included the political police Gestapo and the SD, which served as the SS' intelligence service, and the Ordnungspolizei, which amounted to both the criminal police and regular police.
Can you elaborate more on this? I've read about Free Corps assassinations of politicians and how they put down communist uprisings by killing anyone they perceived to be a threat, but I didn't know they targeted people for reasons like that.
