International sanctions/shunnings only work if the target country is sanctioned/shunned. So Russians get caught doping, their athletes are still allowed to compete in a celebration of sports and international unity. So Russians invade another country. Their athletes are still allowed to compete in a celebration of sports and international unity. A few on the IOC are getting some nice bonus checks.
all of those nations had volatile terrorist groups launching assaults on foreign nations and instigating those conflicts, and none of them were "invaded" with the intention of annexation, except you could argue palestine I guess but thats a conflict where both side's goal is annexation and has been for centuries so its kind of a moot point.
None of them are. They may talk about it just to get it out that they sort of don't like Russia but that's all that's going to happen. This was made pretty clear with China and the Beijing olympics.
But I think the point of boycotting at this stage is to make a political statement that delegitimises and has an adverse financial effect on the IOC in retribution for its refusal to condemn Russia, thus incentivising other capitalists to reassess the viability of maintaining working relationships with Russia. And I think boycotts achieve that very well.
