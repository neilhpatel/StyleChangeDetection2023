I already told you: by smoking. Tobacco smoke introduces carcinogenic compounds into your body which create random mutations in the genome of your cells. Even gametes.

It is the highest form of hipocrisy. You can edit the genes of your unborn kids as much as you want, you can smoke for instance or consume any other genotoxic substance you please. You have the right to introduce any number of randim mutations. But if you introduce a single, well-characterised mutation suddenly everybody is outraged.
I see.. So people smoking is the same thing as people genetically manipulating genes of others, with no idea the ancillary consequences? You seem to be an expert on false analogies for sure, the rest? not so much...tripling down on stupidity still leaves the fact that it is stupidity in the first place...it is the internet though, so a quadrupling down and more false analogies are sure to come. Let the logical fallacies continue sir.
