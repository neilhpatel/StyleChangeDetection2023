As far as things religions have "incidentally gotten right" I have to disagree. Most of the world has been religious since the beginning of recorded history, and we've seen progress constantly on a macro scale. Have those religions been weaponized for political purposes? Yes. But overall, the most advanced nations have centralized religion in common as a political mechanism. The biggest lapses in progress, particularly in human rights and mass executions/apathetic starvation, in the last 200 years have come from countries that did away with religion completely.
Yes? Which totally contradicts the grandparent post. Some religions were really big on education and literacy and yes it was used a lot as tool for indoctrination.
Nope! Very much an atheist. You can hold a position on religion and still respect the position of others without reducing them to a stereotype that matches your own preconceived notions of varying groups that comprise hundreds of millions of humans across the planet.
His dad is Swedish. He just applied for a dual citizenship when he was denied entry in Sweden and got it.
