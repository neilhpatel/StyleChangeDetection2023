Fear could also be a driving factor, with one of the frequently mentioned being the belief that their ultimate fate was cannibalistic. Killing themselves on their own terms was thus a better end than being eaten by their white captors. Although unusual in its number, one such example which stands out for this is the Prince of Orange, which docked in 1737 on Saint Kitts, and saw over thirty captive Africans kill themselves in the harbor waters when a local enslaved man boarded the ship at joked at them they were about to be eaten.

When possible, those who had made such a decision would seek to do so on the ship, whether by jumping overboard, or by hanging themselves, but this could often be complicated by the restrained conditions they were kept in, and as such, suicide was perhaps most frequent in the first few days of arrival on American shores.
