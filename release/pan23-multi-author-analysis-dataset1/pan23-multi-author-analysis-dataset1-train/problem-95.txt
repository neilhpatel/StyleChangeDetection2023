I believe you are actually referring to the controversial dismissal of the Australian government in 1975. I recall reading about it on this very subreddit several times. by /u/hillsonghoods to a now deleted question seems to address the thrust of your question.
In order to fund this agenda, the Whitlam government attempted to circumvent the Loans Council (which it considered very conservative and likely to run interference for the conservatives) and borrow around 4 billion dollars via a London-based commodities dealer, Tirath Khemlani, who claimed to have access to vast Middle Eastern funds (and who had apparently arranged government loans for the UK, France, and Italy in the previous year). The mooted deal with Khemlani ended up falling apart once it became the focus of public scrutiny, which neither party really wanted. Deputy Prime Minister/Treasurer Jim Cairns tried pursuing other avenues for fundraising, and it apparently happened that Cairns (whether freely or as a victim of subterfuge) signed a deal with a Melbourne businessman, George Harris, which promised Harris a 2.5% brokerage fee for securing a loan for something up to $500 million.
