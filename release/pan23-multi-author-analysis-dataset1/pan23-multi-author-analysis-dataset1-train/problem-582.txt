From your side you knew you had to register the car. It wasn’t registered and towed. That a security guard let you in or you were eligible to register it doesn’t matter. You parked a car that wasn’t properly designated to be there. Seems the limit is 2 cars per resident, so let’s say you had 10 cars. Does a security guard verifying you live there allow the 10th car to be parked in the garage? Of course not.
Yes but they sent a memo to us last week about the broken gate and towing enforcement language stating: “ Our towing company is on watch 24/7 to remove any vehicles that park inside our garage that are not registered and are not a resident.” I am a resident but my car was not registered, so the language they used made me assume I could park in the garage and register the car when I could.
The management send this last week: “Our towing company is on watch 24/7 to remove any vehicles that park inside our garage that are not registered and are not a resident. “ it was not an “and/or”, it was “and not a resident”.
