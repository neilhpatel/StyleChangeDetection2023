Other options might include selling this debt to a professional debt collector. There are a few out there that deal with small personal debts. You'd get, at best, pennies on the dollar - if you walked away with $100 for the $5,000 debt, I'd be stunned - but it's better than nothing and it lets you close this out. You can also write off the debt entirely, formally or informally. Conversely, if you think his precarity is likely to improve over time, suing him now and letting the judgment sit until he's able to pay might be a valid strategy, although you'll want to be very sure you know when and how you need to file to renew it.
Thank you so much for all your help! Now to figure out how to tell him I’m moving forward with the lawsuit ;w; I think there might be a little bit of money I can take every month.
So the issue I have now is I’m not sure if going through with the lawsuit will do anything except make things more difficult? Legally speaking what would be the best option here.
California? You won’t get anything, even if you know how to effectively enforce the judgment. California law recently changed to protect judgment debtors bank accounts up to $1800, if he has less than that in his bank accounts you can’t seize anything.
