Hi there anyone interested in recommending things to OP While you might have a title to share, this is still a thread on /r/AskHistorians, and we still want the replies here to be to an /r/AskHistorians standard - presumably OP would have asked at /r/history or /r/askreddit if they wanted non-specialist opinion. So give us some indication why the thing you're recommending is valuable, trustworthy, or applicable Posts that provide no context for why you're recommending a particular podcast/book/novel/documentary/etc, and which aren't backed up by a historian-level knowledge on the accuracy and stance of the piece, will be removed.
I can attest to this. I'm currently majoring in history at my university. I started with Khan Academy and Crash Course videos when I was a kid, took AP tests in high school, then in college started with modern India, then the Viking era, then the Neronian age, and in the fall I do Tudor England, only now deciding on specialization. There's nothing wrong with the pursuit of knowledge out of order as long as you're pursuing knowledge (and enjoying it!).
Oxford University also has some wider resources for students wanting to study history, including history-related podcasts:
