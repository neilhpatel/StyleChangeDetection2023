It wasn't until UK told her to f off that she swapped the burqa for a baseball cap and started 'regretting' everything.
It's utterly irrelevant. I don't know many people who've ended up on the wrong side of the law. It doesn't really matter though, because I still think they deserve a trial.
I think everyone has a right to a fair trial, don't you? Even if they are a child? Or an adult? Or if they've done something horrible? Because that's the only way we get to really explore the facts, rather than the hype.
She isn’t arbitrarily being deprived of UK citizenship. She has been documented committing and admitted to engaged in criminal acts (terrorism). That means under UK law she is subject to having it revoked as she has access and a right to another citizenship, Bangladesh. Despite what you claim this law does not target those who only possess UK citizenship with no right to any other citizenship, so no it doesn’t make someone stateless and cannot be used as such. It also has a right of appeal which she used and lost.
