I could, but this is reddit and I ain't writing a thesis. So I'll just note that 65 countries have declared independence from Britain alone. Britain was not alone in running around the globe conquering everything it could, it was just the most successful. China and Russia have so much internal strife because they're both several former countries stitched together by military and economic might, and of course the USSR used to have several more countries under its thumb.
Guess what genius. One can be opposed to the Iraq war, and Russias genocide in Ukraine. One doesn't preclude the other.
With looming food/water resource strife due to climate change and general environmental collapse, i'd say, based on human history, it's most likely that the largest nations will begin tearing the small ones apart and engaging in levels of genocide not seen since the Mongols devastated what is now Iran.
Nah. Americans are not afraid to call it a war. Gulf War, war in Iraq, War in Afghanistan, War on Terror, War on Drugs, etc. If it can be called a war, then it will be called a war.
