The most likely outcome at this point is that Republicans control the house, and there's a virtual tie in the US senate.
If the Republicans control the house, the question is going to be, who is the speaker, and who is he beholden to? Will he bring up bills to aide ukraine and potentially pass them with democratic votes over the objection of the pro-russia freedom caucus crazies? Or will he say "I won't touch it unless the republicans are agreed.".
I had hoped that when Republicans staged a violent coup to seize power and subsequently took away the right of women to control their own bodies that maybe a large majority of voters would turn against the GOP and destroy the GOP at the polls.
Well said. It's so disappointing. Where is all the pro choice vote. I know R's have gerrymandered the hell out of the districts, but still. I'd be interested to see a total vote breakdown with all districts added up. I keep seeing that a high percentage of population supports pro choice, where the hell is everyone at?
