Edit: I feel the need to be clear that when I say "Mussolini took power legally" that is not a moral judgement. He and his party used violent intimidation to "persuade" voters to vote a certain way, wrote terribly biased legislation that strenhened his hold on the government, staged a coup which is obviously anti-democratic, and the list goes on. However, if all Mussolini had was a couple thousand armed followers, it is unlikely he would ever have taken power. He had the support of the majority of conservative politicians who twisted the existing law or wrote new ones to legally transfer power to Mussolini.
With the rise of far-right fascist-adjacent leaders like Trump and Meloni, this pattern of fascist takeovers is becoming increasingly important to be able to recognize lest we end up with another Mussolini.
Nope sorry. People and political movements can be fascists even when they are not in power or have not yet consolidated power.
