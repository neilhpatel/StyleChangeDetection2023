This used to be understood as a fundamentally unamerican line of thinking to make certain people unmentionable. I challenge anyone to come up with another group of law abiding people it’s illegal to discuss in a school and that if someone accuses you of discussing in a school you could get fired for.
What other group of citizens that haven’t broken a law are not speakable about in schools to the point that the suggestion you did speak about them suffices to get you fired? For that matter what other group of law abiding people do parents get to decide what constitutes talking about them in order to fire teachers over? Name a __single__ one.
Will Florida revert to pre-Civil War practices, with Florida post masters refusing to deliver such unacceptable material as The Atlantic?
If you can't say gay, then you can't say straight. The core argument is identical. Prevent children from being exposed to sexuality. No discussion of mommy and daddy, or babies and where they come from. You are genderless and sexless until middle school.
