Unfortunately there is nothing you can do prior to birth but start documenting everything now. Time dates even pictures for after the child's birth it maybe easier to make your case. Treat it as if it were a child custody case. It may go against your instincts to be overly helpful right now but do what you can to stay close. Maybe in the future there will be laws to change this. Maybe you can be the one to change it. I am a tribal member And we can be jailed for the entire pregnancy if we use drugs or alcohol. My uncle couldn't keep his daughter so er and she kept having kids so he spear headed a law to make sure future children were not subjected to the affects of FAS. Unfortunately it is rarely upheld. Good luck.
Maryland also lacks a putative father registry, but allows fathers to submit an affidavit of paternity, although it requires consent of the mother.
6. Call CPS now and ask for info and referrals for you and for her. There may be services in your community you donâ€™t even know about, that might be helpful.
