She did order the drink herself. Although I would agree with you that usually it would be her responsibility to check the ingredients, she did more than her due diligence in confirming the safety of the drink. Although she did not check the website beforehand (to my knowledge), she was provided with fraudulent information by an employee of the company which almost led to her death. Had the employee said “I don’t know, check our website” then they would’ve acted appropriately and it would’ve been her responsibility to check the website. However, in this case I highly disagree with “it’s incumbent on people… to do more than ask questions” as it is absolutely the moral and legal responsibility of the company and its employees not to provide fraudulent information which directly results in severe bodily harm.
Milk is an ingredient in a lot of things. I just don’t believe that Starbucks is out here training their baristas that “milk free” in the case of an allergy only applies to the milk carton.
Starbucks regularly advertises drinks as “dairy free” and all their stores will say they can accommodate a milk allergy. Note that’s a milk allergy, and not mere lactose intolerance.
