And what we have here is a semantic misunderstanding. What Seneca and other classical writers mean by "pity" is not the feeling of being moved to compassion, which is perhaps how many people would use it today. Instead, it is a sudden, gut wrench of misery toward the suffering of others. And many classical philosophers made the point that acting on that gut instinct was generally not an efficient way to help people. Seneca wanted the emperor, and the Roman government more generally, to help the poor and desperate. Which they did, through things like the grain dole and disaster relief efforts. Pre-Christian Romans certainly had a concept of "These people are suffering, and the state should help them.".
First of all, it completely ignores possible endogeneity problems. Unless you are a very particular brand of Christian (which BTW would be literally considered heretic by the Catholic Church), you have to admit that the Gospels and even moreso the teachings of the Apostoles and of theologicians are merely interpretations of an allegedly divine message. Of course, if you are an atheist, they are outright inventions. These begets the obvious question: how were the interpreters/inventors of Christ's message influenced by the cultural milieu around them? I could go full Nietzsche and say that Christianity is just platonism for the masses, so any point you make about Christianity shaping our values should actually be about Platonism shaping our values. Or maybe notice how Christ in the end was an Essenic, so we are all Essenic Jews. And so on. And that's only the start A big big part of how Christianity is actually lived today comes from medieval theology of Aristotelic inspiration, so maybe we are actually all Aristotelians Treating Christianity as a set of beliefs that is fixed and endogenous is plainly false and misleading.
