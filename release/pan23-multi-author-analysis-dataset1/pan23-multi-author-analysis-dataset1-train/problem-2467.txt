I'm surprised a actual Qatari was driving the taxi , they only make up %14 percent of thr population and since by law for foreign businesses to operate in qatar you have to hire a local there are a bunch of " just sit here and look good " positions open in companies.
Well its your anecdote against his. I expect educated people in general do tend toward a more secular attitude, but the "educated" (higher education) population of Arabs is also significantly smaller than most developed nations. I don't think its fair or perhaps accurate to invalidate his comment/view.
Between leftover nazi propaganda, general antisemitism that's existed since Muhammad, hated of Israel, authoritarian ruler propaganda and information control, and lower levels of education amongst the general population...
Wow way to jump the shark there. I’m not blaming anyone just pointing out that under what op said they’re wrong and under what your saying they’re wrong. You can’t have it both ways if it’s one long continuous war that Arabs started then that’s it it’s one war. Running around saying every single war was started by Arabs makes no sense, there’s just the one long war, right? And on the inverse side if their are multiple wars they didn’t start every single one the second Arab Israel war proves that when Israel invade Egypt.
