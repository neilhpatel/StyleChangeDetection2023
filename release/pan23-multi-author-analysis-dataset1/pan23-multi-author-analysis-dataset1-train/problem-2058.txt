That is why I suggest that we do not think in the same way that they do, by identifying competing ideologies/worldviews/religions/ political views as fixed pathologies that they have chosen and that need to be eliminated. It starts out as "these are terrible people who have chosen their fate, and they just need to be ignored/ marginalized/ humiliated/ cancelled/suffer the consequences of their terribleness." What are you going to do when that doesn't work, and there's too many of them, and they refuse to quietly be culturally stamped out? Do you impose "re-education?" or do you go straight for the genocide?
I guess I just dont understand how people get away with not having insurance - I've switched insurance carriers and was promptly hassled by the MVA because of a non existent lapse in coverage during the switch and threatened to have registration revoked if I couldnt prove I currently have coverage.
No. Western elites do not want to waste energy on your temper tantrums. You can do whatever you like, until you are not starting a war. No one bothered Russia before 2014.
