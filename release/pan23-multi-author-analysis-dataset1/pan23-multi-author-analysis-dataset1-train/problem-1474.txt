Like, yes, but also the right wing in Israel is reporting it was about Arabs because someone was waving a Palestinian flag at the protests. So the right is using that fact to delegitamize them.
It is interesting that Israel's arch enemy Iran is simultaneously undergoing a popular revolt against fascistic leadership.
Plus there were other reforms in it. Currently justices are appointed by a committee of several representatives of the Israeli Bar and two MKs, one from the coalition and one from the opposition. The reform would change that so that the committee is based more off of the public's voice. At the moment, if all members of knesset agree on someone to be appointed, but the Bar association doesn't, they don't get appointed because they have the majority in the committee. The proposed changes would be that the committee is half Bar members, and half politicians and half the politicians from the coalition and the other half from the opposition. It's like how, in theory, Americans have say over the Justices on their Supreme Court because they chose the president. In Israel, the public never chose the Bar association representatives on the judge appointing committee.
