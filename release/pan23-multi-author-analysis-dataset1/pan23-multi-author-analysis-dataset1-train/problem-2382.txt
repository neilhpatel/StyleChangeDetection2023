But to give some context to this, Galicia - which nowadays is split between southern Poland and southwestern Ukraine - was a northeastern province of the Austro Hungarian empire that was massively poor, rural, and agricultural. Only about a quarter of the population was literate compared to 90% elsewhere, and infrastructure was substantially lacking. The western half was mostly Catholic Poles, the eastern half mostly Greek Orthodox Ukrainians, Yiddish speaking Jews were roughly equivalent to the two other populations and scattered throughout, and German speakers were a tiny minority. (Also, my national and racial terms wouldn't have been contemporary until after the First World War, but I'm using them for the sake of simplicity here.).
The Soviets proceeded to annex them during their occupation of Poland from 1939 to 1941, and then after Barbarossa, the Germans occupied Boryslaw. However frustratingly to the Germans, many of the specialists for drilling and refining escaped the June onslaught of the Wehrmacht, so production efficiency continued to decline.
