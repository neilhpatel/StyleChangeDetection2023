No one is mad at the art or the artists. This is about getting attention to raise awareness of climate change. And before you say "they should find another way to protest, there have been many other protests that didn't involve art and didn't get the same attention. Like this from a few weeks ago:
Exactly. I don’t know why people don’t understand the message. I understand it’s art. But people have been trying everything to get attention on climate change. Like it’s getting to a point that people are deciding to do crazy shit like this. Also let’s not act like most art pieces arent owned by super wealthy individuals whom just use art as clout… There’s more art pieces out there than Elephants, Tigers, and Lions combined. What’s more important? Life or art?
I have done a considerable amount of work in environmental engineering, developing cutting edge remediation technologies.
