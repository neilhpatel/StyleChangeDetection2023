The plan is to get rid of the platform (the LRU and the base M270s stocked alike) and replace them by a new long range artillery platform by 2027. There is no report about France sending its old M270s to Ukraine and there probably will never be. I don't know why anyone would think France would very publicly be sending its old stocked M270 systems that are only able to operate the M26 rockets, when it literally signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions that deems them inhumane to use lmao. Neither the UK nor Germany sent their old M270s. They signed the same convention.
They absolutely could, itâ€™s just that each countries weapons manufacturers purposefully differentiate its equipment/ammunition/parts etc, in order to ensure that you have to keep buying their system-specific stuff from them. The same way printer manufacturers design products that require you to keep buying ink cartridges from them. Because money. So yeah, politically difficult considering the stranglehold that the worldwide military industrial complex has on government and legislators.
They did. The MARS II is the European variant upgrade on top of the M270A1 upgrade. It was delivered by both Germany and France to Ukraine. I do not know precisely what variant the UK sent, but I have no reason to assume they'd sent anything less than M270A1s as well.
