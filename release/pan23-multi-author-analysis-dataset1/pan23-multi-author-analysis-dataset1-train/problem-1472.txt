Thanks - that’s very helpful and I’m actually quite surprised that there’s a good chance they could understand each other. I would have thought the languages were very different.
First, excavators at the monastery of Portmahomack on the eastern coast of Scotland discovered two men (burials 129 and 153) who had been raised in Scandinavia (inferred from strontium and oxygen isotope analysis of their bones) and buried in the 700s (based on radiocarbon dating). Although it's not entirely clear what language would have been the lingua franca of the monastery, it's surprisingly definitive evidence that some Scandinavians were crossing the North Sea before the Viking Age.
Second, while we should be cautious about reading the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle too literally, its first report of viking violence at Portland in 787 hinges around the assumption that Scandinavians were already known as traders before the Viking Age. This fits the evidence of Portmahomack above, and it also fits what we know of Viking Age ship technology. In the later Viking Age it would be easy to tell the longship of a raiding party from a cargo-carrying knorr, but early Viking-Age ships like the Gokstad ship or Oseberg ship were both long enough to have a large crew and wide enough to carry a bit of cargo. That makes the story of the ill-fated reeve of Portland plausible. And it further suggests that there were ongoing interactions in the 700s where Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons needed to find ways to be mutually intelligible.
