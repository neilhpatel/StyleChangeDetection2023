Russia is definitely prepping for a "stab in the back" narrative post war. Nice excuse to purge any "undesirables" too. "Oh we totally would've won but the unpatriotic stopped us from warring hard enough.".
Wagner isn’t Russia. They’re just thugs hired. They don’t have any authority. They are employees. Shut the fuck up Prigozhin. Do your job and finish getting killed. We’ll all be pissing and dancing on your grave soon.
He doesn't have any real power, as he can't even do anything against the (pro-Putin) Saint Petersburg mayor that's criticizing him for using an illegal mercenary army, is constantly being searched by Russia's security apparatus, and doesn't even get a meeting from Putin. Plain and simply, there's no evidence on the ground that Prigozhin is building up influence among Russian siloviki, military and policymakers.
I suspect his big value is that he gives off the appearance of "independence" from Putin, allows the latter to shift responsibility for breaking Russian law to subordinates like Prigozhin, and makes Putin seem "moderate" in comparison.
