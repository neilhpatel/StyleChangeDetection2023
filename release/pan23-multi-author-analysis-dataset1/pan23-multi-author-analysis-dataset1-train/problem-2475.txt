You said they got 3 of the 4 in the plan for you. So the 4th one is not in the plan, correct? If so the debt consolidation company has nothing to do with that account, you are responsible for the terms of that account.
Debt consolidation companies are real, although there have been many fraudulent ones over the years as well. I'm a former debt consolidation counselor. The way they work is that most credit card companies have arrangements with them where they will lower your payment and most times your interest rate to help you to pay it back. The reason they do this is to at least get paid something instead of nothing at all. But not all creditors or types of credit work with them. Most collection agencies will not, most bank loans. Payday loans, student loans, lines of credit or secured loans won't work with the program.
They work differently than consolidation or management programs. With settlement, the money goes into something like an escrow and the companies arenâ€™t getting paid until they agree to settle the debt for a percentage.
