It's ultimately up to the DOJ to review current laws and current precedents are for mishandlings of classified information. The legalese knowingly and intent according to 18 U.S. Code ยง 1924 probably will make a huge factor in filing charges, but so will precedent. Unless some facts change, I'd imagine that it would be more difficult for a prosecutor to justify pursuing charges in a case where knowing & intent is harder to prove because the knowledge of the existence of files were volunteered & voluntarily turned over. Meanwhile, it'd be easier for a prosecutor to justify filing charges for someone whose intent may be easier to prove as they received numerous legal requests & a judge needed to sign a warrant.
Exactly. Enough with the baseless conspiracy theories. Investigate Biden just like we did trump. Holding Biden responsible is better imo even if the right refuses to hold trump accountable.

Both obviously mishandled classified information, which wasn't excusable especially after 2016 & even less excusable now. One seems to have handed it all over the second he was aware - but several years later, the other had boxes of he seemed to be aware was at least some type of information & wasn't co-operating despite having taxpayer provided legal counsel then he and witnesses made a lot of public comments regarding said information.
