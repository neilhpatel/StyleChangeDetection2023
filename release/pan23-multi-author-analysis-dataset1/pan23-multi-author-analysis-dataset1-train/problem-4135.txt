The US would be under assault from extremely angry Muslims everywhere by invading the country with the Kaaba. What are you going to do when the Saudi military retreats into Mecca? Just let them indefinitely? What would you do about the thousands of Jihadists that would spring up within US borders that would become enraged at the US ravaging the 1 holy land in Islam?
exactly. I don't mean what I'm about to say as disrespect to Khashoggi, but as lot of journalists have been killed by oppresive regimes. Reddit seems weirdly obsessed with this one specifically.
It wasn't the Saudi Government in full - nor the royal family itself who aided Bin-Laden, considering their position of having Bin-Laden exiled and his offenses to the family, - but likely an influential individual or individuals within the royal family, government, or military - ala possible suspect Omar al-Bayoumi. However this by no means that the Saudi Government, Intelligence, Family, or Military was involved - which no subsequent report has found them to be. Omar al-Bayoumi is on shaky ground, however.
