This reminds me of a story: I work in media and about twelve years ago I independently organized a panel about social media and news/journalism. I held it at the Yahoo campus and I had Reddit founders Aaron Swartz and Steve Huffman on the panel, along with some other key industry folks, an academic, and some Silicon Valley reporters in the general audience. This one dude, J- - - - - O- - - - - -, wanted to be on the panel, and I declined. We had too many people already (even five makes it tough) and I didn’t see what he would add to the discussion. (He was a “thought leader,” not a journalist or platform founder.).

Yep! And his presidency started when he was sworn in with the biggest lie at the time so far. "To serve and protect....etc..." What a horrible day that was.
