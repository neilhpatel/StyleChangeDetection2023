The Royal Navy made every effort to cover up the loss of Audacious. The loss was not officially admitted until the 13th November 1918. Until then, her name appeared on the RN's official fleet lists, and on movements of naval shipping. Her crew were instructed to tell anyone who asked about the ship that she had been damaged. As there had been no casualties from her crew, there was little need to lie to family members about the fate of their loved ones. The steamer Montcalm was procured and converted into a decoy version of Audacious, as part of a more general process of conversions (). Unfortunately, the presence of Olympic greatly complicated the coverup. She was on the last leg of a trip between New York and Liverpool, and had a full complement of passengers aboard. While many of these were British, and thus could be threatened with legal action if they discussed the sinking with the press, there were also neutral citizens aboard, especially Americans. Britain had no interest in provoking America to action, and did not want to interfere in the rights of these passengers. Equally, though, they had had a front-row view of the sinking of one of the RN's most modern battleships. Olympic was held in Lough Swilly for several days, before being allowed to proceed to Liverpool. The passengers were able to spread the news of the sinking. On November 14th 1914, the Philadelphia Public Ledger ran a photograph of the sinking, taken by a passenger on Olympic. Even so, the RN and British government persisted with the cover-up attempt.
Military intelligence is complex. Is it proof it sunk, or a plant to cover up that she was salvaged and is back in service?
