No, they cannot. Any attempt by a state to recall a member of Congress is prohibited by the Federal Constitution. A vacancy in the office of U.S. senator or representative can be created only by the incumbent's death or resignation, the expiration of his term, or some direct action of the body (the Senate or the House of Representatives) which is empowered to expel members (Burton v. U.S. 202 US 344, at 369). There is no constitutional authority to hold a special election that would be required to fill a seat in the event a member was recalled. Article I, section 4 of the Federal Constitution relating to the time for holding a regular election and Article XVII of the Amendments on holding a special election only when a vacancy exists combine to preclude an election to replace a member of Congress who had been recalled. Federal constitutional provisions supersede any state recall procedures for these offices.
