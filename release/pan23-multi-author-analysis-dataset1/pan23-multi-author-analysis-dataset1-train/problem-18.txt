Yeah, I thought the entire world was still masquerading around under the position that Israel officially did not have nukes but everyone knew they did.
Hahaha! Credibility? I think they lost that around the second time they failed to prevent a genocide, despite having troops right there. In Rwanda's case the commander begged to raid weapon stockpiles. UN leadership said do nothing. Even when their troops were traumatized by the sounds of women and children being raped and butchered just beyond their walls.
Exactly. This talking point that "Ukraine couldn't have used the nukes" anyways doesn't make any sense when you consider that a lot of the people tasked with building and maintaining Soviet nukes were Ukrainian. Prior to the war, Ukrainian teams were being utilized to maintain the Russian nuke supply.
Exactly. It's out and about in the open that a few Arab countries had extensive genocide plans were they to win any of the three main Israel-Arab wars. In fact, part of the Arab soldier's motivation was based on an eventual slaughtering of the jews, as promised by some higher ups in the army.
