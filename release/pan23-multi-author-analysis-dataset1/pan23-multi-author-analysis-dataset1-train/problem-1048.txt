Not only that, the dominant religion in South Korea is christianity at the moment (if you dont count the unreligious), where as in Japan only about 2% are Christians.
[According to the Korean Statistical Information Service (the Korean gov'ts official statistics branch), in 2015 7.9% of Koreans identified as Catholic, and 19.7% as Protestant, and Buddhism was at 15.5% while those w/ no religious affiliation was at about 56.1%] (.
By contrast, some South American economic efforts can be categorized as Import-Substitution industrialization. The example that I know of regarding this is Argentina under Per√≥n's first regime, where industries were set up to produce goods domestically, to be consumed domestically[1]. Also historically, South American economic activity has centered around agricultural or natural resource exports. Could it be that there's some kind of historical inertia, or lack of know-how on to set up capital-intensive industries as opposed to good ol' banana, coffee, and tobacco? I don't know, this is also a hard question.
