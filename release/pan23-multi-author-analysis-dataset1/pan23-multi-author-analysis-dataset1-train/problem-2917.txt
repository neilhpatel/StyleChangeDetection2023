The only thing everyone can unify on is that Franklin's embracing and reprinting of the speech helped spread the popularity of the concept of a confederation of colonies, but we can't say where that concept first originated or if any founders directly sourced the specifics for any founding documents and philosophies with certainty. There are lots of commonalities but they existed elsewhere that the colonists had exposure to and no founder ever said "do this like the six nations do" or anything like that. Yet Native delegations definitely attended many of our conventions and multiple influential founders, like Franklin and Jefferson, met with Native leaders and had exposure to their culture many times (Jefferson even excavated a burial mound in the early 1770s or early 1780s belonging to the old village of Monasukapanough near his home, becoming one of, if not the, first scientific archeological digs in America and providing a template for future archeologists to follow).
