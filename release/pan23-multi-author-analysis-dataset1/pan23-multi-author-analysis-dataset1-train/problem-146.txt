I mean I was pretty positive toward Russia some years ago. I've studied there, I can speak Russian language and I've studied their economic history and how to do business with them. The potential should have been huge and I too believed doing business with them and tying our interests together was bound to build peace and understanding. I still can't fathom why it all changed especially when everything they now do will effectively ruin their economy, reputation and future as a nation.
Yep. Or they will just use it as leverage. "Sure would be a shame if we turned off the power your people relie on to not freeze/cook this winter/summer, during the middle of a cold snap/heat wave. You better not help this country we just invaded or yaknow, that might just happen!".
We did buy quite a lot from the Eastern neighbor but we also learned very quickly that once we got rid of their electricity we have to come up with new sources and basically erased the memory of Russian connection altogether. I think it's safe to say this is the only viable option since they as a country lost all their credibility as a business partner for decades to come.
