If this was the intent, why haven't we seen large scale saturation bombing like what was seen in the Second World War, or as recently as Vietnam with Operation Linebacker II. Russia has over 100 strategic bombers in their air force between the TU-22M, the TU-95, and the TU160. Sure, they are running out of precision munitions, but you don't need precision missiles to take out an apartment building, as long as you can hit a city, you can hit an apartment building. Russian 5th generation and 4++th generation multirole fighters like the SU-57 and MIG-35 should be able to take out Ukrainian air defense systems and achieve air superiority.
Here's the thing though- they haven't. They should, but they haven't. I'm not going to speculate as to all the reasons, but clearly Russia does not feel they actually have that capability of they'd have done so.
I don't know the answer to that, but I do know this is the NATO take on Russia's current strategy, as well as many analysts.
While you are correct about that being the strategy in a lot of cases, that's not what Russia is doing in Ukraine. It's not really about breaking civilian morale either, although that is actually pretty close.
