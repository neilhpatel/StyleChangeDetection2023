Easement would probably work. For him to claim ownership under adverse possession is not easy. It may be as easy as stating he had your permission to use it.
Your second sentence might not be really "right" (IANAL, I am a law student taking property law at the moment though, but this is not legal advice) - if someone adversely possesses property, that's it - it's theirs now - but there are factors that go into how a court might rule if one of the parties challenges the other for control (things like was the possession actually adverse, was it clearly evident, did they pay property taxes) - essentially, they'll judge if the adverse possession is legit or not. To your later point, the adversely possessing party could bring a quiet title action to get a court to recognize this formally, but it's not "required.".
Thus by failing to act to protect your property, and now with the knowledge that he is taking ownership/maintenance responsibilities of part of it (by maintaining his driveway partially on your property) you are tacitly giving him stake over the portion of land.
