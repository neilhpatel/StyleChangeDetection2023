Doesn't surprise me. When I went to vote on Friday in Cobb County, they couldn't even have an accurate/working wait times website. The map said 20 min, it took over an hour. Oh and the poll works just kept saying it wouldn't be this long if we had just come to vote before today/didn't wait until the last day. Lots of other stuff that made me feel uneasy was said too.
Been trying to access the Georgia election portal site for the past few days to check on the status of my mail-in ballot (that I sent in a few weeks ago; was able to request an electronic ballot, fortunately, since it was a UOCAVA ballot), but I just keep getting 403 errors. Looks like they've now geo-blocked non-US IPs, from testing with a few US-based proxies, so that's a nice little "fuck you" to us overseas voters. At least they didn't come up with that idea before I put in my ballot request originally, I suppose.
Exactly. Less likely to be caught up in a dumb lawsuit trying to get my ballot tossed out if I vote in person. That option isn't available to everyone though.
