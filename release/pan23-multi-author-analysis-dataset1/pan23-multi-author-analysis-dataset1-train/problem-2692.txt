So someone correct me if I’m wrong, as I’m “armchair-generaling” over here, but my layman’s understanding is that the tech is pretty different. The Iron Dome is designed to counter a very specific kind of threat: many simultaneous targets who are relatively slow, small, and with predictable, ballistic flight paths. The Patriot system is indeed mobile, but it’s speciality is in countering threats that are much faster and harder to hit. The difficulty in countering threats like that scale dramatically with speed and complexity, and the Patriot system is probably one of the best in the world when it comes to that.
