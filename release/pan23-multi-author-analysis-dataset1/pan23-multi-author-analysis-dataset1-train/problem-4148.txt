I think you could be right about black voters not liking Bernie making issues about class instead of race, but I do agree with Bernie on that too. A lot of things that affect racial minorities disproportionately also affect all poor people disproportionately. That's not to say there isn't racism, of course there is. I think if anything, historically black voters have written class off because they are intensely focused on race (not that that's a bad thing).
I just meant if they're very progressive, because typically if you look at black voters as a monolithic group (which I'm not sure we should), they lean fairly conservative, or at least centrist. They already don't want to vote for progressives, make them white and they want to vote for them even less.

Obviously not. The very nature of citizen's united means that this probably needs a constitutional amendment to fix completely.
