Agree. It’s time to get rid of the red states. They can fuck right off. I’m happy in the United States of New England. We’ll sign treaties with the Great Lake Republic and California. Everyone else can live out their Christo-Fascist wet dream and leave me out of it.

Exactly. Imagine accusing the boss of racial discrimination after they call the employee a racial slur and drop their pay because of their race. Now, under this law, if the employee accuses them of it (by suing them in Federal Court), this law allows them to sue that employee m for defamation. And even if it’s true, they still lose. Because they accused them.
