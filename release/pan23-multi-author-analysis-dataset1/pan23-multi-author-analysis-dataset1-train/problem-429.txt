It's also worth considering that because of their advantage in equipment and training, knights were also more likely to survive through multiple campaigns and so gain valuable experience, thus becoming the veteran fighters of most armies. A fully armored knight on a horse can be quite difficult to kill, since his mount can quickly bear him away from a fight where the odds are against him [the armor is self explanatory]. By contrast, a poor footsoldier with more limited protection has a much harder time escaping a lost fight, especially with enemy cavalry giving chase. The knights' wealth provided additional, more direct protection as well; they were more attractive targets for capture, rather than slaughter, since their families had the wealth to give their captor a tidy ransom. Once ransomed, they would continue fighting in future campaigns, retaining their experience and growing progressively more skilled. Common footsoldiers could also be ransomed, especially in bundles, and knights definitely still got killed, but enemies were more likely to go out of their way to capture rather than kill knights.
Yes. You're starting from the assumption that a knight of the Medieval Period is like a gentleman of the 19th Century or some rich type today. Again, note well that every societal expectation put on a knight, from the royals on down, is predicated on their martial skill. A knight who is not even trying to fight is not living up to the expectations of his station. This is reflected not simply in social pressure but also by law, as we can see from the Assizes of Arms of 1181 and 122 and the Statute of Winchester. These three laws denote brackets of wealth, where if you possess a given amount of money or chattels, you must also have a given set of weaponry. The common theme in the three? More is always expected of those with more money, with the Assize of 1181 outright saying:
