Fuck republicans - I will hate everything that will come out of these investigations and I pray that more Americans really see the evil in these investigations and send republicans packing in 2024.
I get that overall the average person doesn’t care about Hunter Biden, but holy hell these investigations will be absolutely monstrous- the republicans will literally do everything to try to destroy “a private citizen” just to generate drama for their Fox News viewers.
The crazies are now in control of the House. This is the price we will pay for a large portion of the electorate more interested in theatrics rather than governance.

Unlikely. This story isn't going anywhere because Hunter Biden is a private citizen, and they can't go after him the way they go after politicians without getting the shit sued out of them. Look at Dominion--they're getting fucking wrecked for having crossed the line there, and Hunter will have more protections as a private person that Dominion had.
