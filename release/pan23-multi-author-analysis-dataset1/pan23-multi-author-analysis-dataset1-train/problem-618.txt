It was actually my FMLA reason posted on the fridge for my co-workers/nurses/doctors/janitors/co-workers family to see. I was beyond humiliated. I made a copy and took a picture with my phone. I sent the image to HR and the director her immediate boss. Neither responded or cared. She bullied/harassed me to the point I attempted suicide by overdosing in my car. Not even a week later I took a prescribed medication she commented “aren’t you afraid you’re going to overdose” knowing what had happened. That day I left early used my FMLA. The next day I came back and it was on the fridge.
Is your employer a healthcare provider, healthcare clearinghouse, health insurance company, health maintenance organization, or a military/veterans’ health program?
No I didn’t choose to ignore I answered it twice. Asking it again or wording it differently doesn’t change the answer. Yes my employer was the hospital, yes my care was at the same hospital. The FMLA was given to her through HR from my doctor through an entirely private process as it should be. I think my best bet would just to get a local attorney. She has 3 other hippa violations that I know about within this past year. 1 was also a worker who had her health care done at the same facility making her the patient at that time as well. The other two were unknown people to me but obviously important to others and uncalled for behavior.
