From a practical standpoint, you all don't have to be continually harassed by your sister over this matter. And that's what it is, harassment. You can tell her to buzz off and never talk to you again. You can get a restraining order if she continues to do so afterwards. She can either put up a suit and have it decided once and for all or she can leave you alone about it. She's not entitled to continue to drone on about it.
My other sibling and I have discussed our desperate need to have our father set-up an iron clad will because we are terrified of what will happen should there be an iota of ambiguity (she has threatened legal action against extended family regarding a generous inheritance from another deceased family member because she felt her portion was not as much as the deceased intended.).
A common way for a retirement plan to be handled in divorce is for the court to split it into two separate accounts altogether with what is called a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO). To the extent possible under the plan, both spouses would be able to designate their own beneficiaries who would receive whatever the plan provides after their death.
Thank you. What you describe is what makes sense to me, and how things played out. The money that our mother received from my father's pension while she was alive, she either spent or saved. What was saved went to her children and my father resumed receiving his full pension.
