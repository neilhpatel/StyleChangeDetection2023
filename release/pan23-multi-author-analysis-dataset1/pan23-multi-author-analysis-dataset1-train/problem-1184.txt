It's very true! I remember in my AP Euro class after the AP test we just got to do fun projects, so I created about 40 fake Facebook accounts and used them to tell the story of the French Revolution via Facebook updates. xD.
no one here really respects these rules or sees value in them, we just put up with your nonsense in the off chance we'll actually catch a good answer while scrolling through our feeds, which often isn't the case if you're on reddit a lot and not specifically looking to go back in time on this sub.
I love this theme. I'm studying to be a history teacher and I think that this kind of thing would be a super fun classroom activity--so many people think of history as being so dry and hard to relate to, but in reality, so much crazy and entertaining shit has happened, and it's fun to play around with describing historical events as if they were things happening now.
Yes. For 364 days a year, hundreds of flaired users give their time for free to write answers on the subreddit. 1 day a year we let them loosen up a bit and have some fun. It is a bit of levity that they look forward to every year. The vast majority of users enjoy it too.
