Find a nursery to quote the replacement of like size, type, age of the trees, including pulling out the old trunks, digging them out, finding new trees, box replacement, transportation, planting (this is going to be very expensive), labor time and materials.
I just want to say that is terrible! If that happened to me I would be Mad and so upset with them. People are chainsaw trigger happy in this world. They just do not get that the Trees are actually endangered. You lost something Precious and Valuable. The trees need to be replaced. You could sue them for the replacement of at least 50 foot trees to be put back. My mom had giant trees brought to her new home when we moved there because there were no trees. Just tiny saplings. It can be done. I wish you the best and I wouldn't just ignore something like that. It is actually a big deal. They came onto your private property and destroyed your property. Not okay. And the shade those trees provided and Privacy was destroyed by them. They need to fix it.
Probably much higher actually. A friend had this happen and it ended up being in the hundreds of thousands. Its incredibly expensive to plant/replace an adult tree.
Second, criminal liability is . I'd suggest you either print out or open this statute on your phone before calling the cops, because the cops probably aren't familiar with this law. I'd be surprised if your damages aren't over $1,000, pushing this into felony territory.
