I'll counter with I don't see Trump as a true Republican and he won't hold back against DeSantis and won't bow out or unify under Ron if DeSantis wins a "rigged" primary, which is exactly what Don will call it. Trump is a one trick pony and he isn't performing his trick for the betterment of the Republican Party. The infighting over the Speakership is routine party politics but it seems Kevin finds himself in a stickier spot than most would-be Speakers and it's more in the public eye given the volatility of those challenging his bid. The concessions he may have to make could weaken the party and with battleground states narrowly rejecting conservative extremism the tightrope McCarthy is on makes for treacherous footing for the party's national image.
Right? Kevin McCarthy is going to go insane trying to corrall whiny over-priviliged asshats like Gaetz and Greene and Gosar. I wish him the best worst.

Really. You're introducing the thought that "that has never happened" yet the past 6-7 years have been nothing but things that we thought would never happen.
