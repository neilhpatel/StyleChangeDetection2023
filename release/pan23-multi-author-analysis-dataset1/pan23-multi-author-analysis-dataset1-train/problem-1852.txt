"cited anonymous sources as saying that Makarov had allegedly shot himself with a gas-operated hunting rifle at his home in the presence of his wife.".
I wouldn't put it past them to stage some kind of incident involving Russia & Belarus just so NATO has an excuse to invade both countries and take control of all the gas/oil pipelines running through them into Europe from Russia (the real reason why we went after Iraq was oil). The US is.
"Anti-extremism unit..." Well, when somebody in Russia criticizes power, exposed corruption, calling for removal of the politician from office according to the law or voting them out, that's an "extremism", "an attempt on constitutional order". That's a job for "Center "E".
Russia basically has a "stay at home army" of militarized police that amongst other things, arrest protestors, assault and sometimes even murder dissidents, and beat the shit out of and/or extort the russian military on their bases, making sure no army colonel gets any ideas about disobeying the regime.
