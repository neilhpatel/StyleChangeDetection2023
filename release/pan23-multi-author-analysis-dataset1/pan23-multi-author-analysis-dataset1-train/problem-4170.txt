You're right. I can't argue. Biden has himself in a mess. To his credit, from, my understanding, he tried to keep Zelensky out of this to try and get the best sweetheart deal he can get.

I'm a bit wary, and likely would not have done it, if only because it now gives Putin more of an excuse to use more high powered weaponry, including bunker busters or even low grade nuclear weapons (weapons we've used in Afghanistan and Syria) to justify irradicating large amounts of civilian populus under the guise they were being used as a cover for tanks or tank depots.
Okay let me get this straight . You are saying we are wrong to give Ukraine assistance now becasue we might not give it to them later ( and yes this happens before notably and repeatedly with the Kurds ) and you want American leaders to sit down with Russian leaders to stop. War in ukraine. But you also want us to stay out of Ukraine ?
