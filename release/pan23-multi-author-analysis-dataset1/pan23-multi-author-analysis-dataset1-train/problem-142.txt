Believe me when I say he doesn't want to support me in any way possible. He's homophobic, transphobic, racist, sexist and misogynistic, etc.. If I were to be anywhere in the vicinity of this man, it would not be good for my health physically or mentally. I haven't seen him in over eight years and for good reason (that I can not go into because he is literally cyberstalking me, how I know this is because he outed me to a bunch of people that he and them would not have known any information about my identity unless they had my social media).
That's fine, he's allowed to want things he can't have. Even if he loses all custody of you, he will still be obligated to pay support. There's no getting around that, at this point - a judge is _very_ unlikely to approve a custody change that puts all support obligations on a single parent when both parents are in the picture.
Your mother can move to amend custody, if she likes, and she can ask the judge to consider your preferences, again if she likes. Some judges will also ask you of their own accord, if the issue comes before them. Your mother cannot sever your father's right to revisit custody or his obligation to support you.
You lack standing to intervene in your parents' custody dispute. There's no age where you will gain that standing, though at 18 the issue becomes moot as you are no longer under your parents' custody in the first place.
