Physics aren’t even the same it’s fucked. Try to save your friend or she dies. As simple as that. There’s no prison. There’s no jail. There’s no alternative course. It ends in death when it’s at that extreme. The only thing that saved me was I was tired and I ended up calling an ambulance because I was somewhere I shouldn’t have been and I was thirsty as fuck. Then from there I bounced out of that hellish loop.
If so, kindly take her (and important documents or information) to an attorney, (possible divorce attorney’s office) so that she can begin the process of separating herself from the new/old T. During that visit, you can see if she will allow you to become POA.
No. Nobody is going to ask for proof. He will identify himself for the record in court. If she brings this up, she both has no case and sounds like a crazy person, but I suppose that's something she can do if she wants to. The obvious question is why she continued associating with this person for a single second after she became convinced he was an "imposter.".
