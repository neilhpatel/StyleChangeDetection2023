Yep I agree. That's why I'm not worried about people saying well it can give cops overtime. I feel like they would get it anyway. This just reduces risk to others.

Hate Me for this. But you have to release it at somepoint. Release it on a Wednesday at noon. Then what are you doing about the children in schools and the parents at work if things get out of hand. There is no magical time that people will be like. I'm much better now thank you for releasing at this time on this day. I would rather have them wait til after main work hours and school hours when people that want to get home can do so safely. At the end of the day it's going to be bad. No matter when it's released.
