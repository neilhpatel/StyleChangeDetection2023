I work for a homeless shelter. We have monthly events where we help our clients obtain OD’s with just a birth certificate. I have also gotten client’s their social security cards with a paper application and a certified copy of their medical record - no ID. Reach out to 211 if possible, and homeless agencies in your area. They’ll help you. Your situation is very common.
Although proof of citizenship isn't required if already confirmed in SSA records, OP indicates they have legal copies (presumably certified; a BC photocopy is unacceptable) so I would send one just to ensure citizenship isn't an issue.
Good Luck! If you can, tax forms for this year will be sent out in about a month and a half, so trying to do something that will result in a tax form for 2021 would be faster… this sucks so much. (.
Unless OP has another secondary document ie a life insurance policy showing age or DOB, health insurance card with photo ID and/or age or DOB the medical record is probably the best evidence for people without the usual state ID/DL or passport.
