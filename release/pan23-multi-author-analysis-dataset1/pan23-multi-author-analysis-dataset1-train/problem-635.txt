If you were to have looked out over your estate, it probably would have consisted of an inner and outer perimeter. The inner perimeter would have been guarded by gate or wall. It’s ground covering would have been exposed soil, mud, and maybe some native or naturalized plant materials. The most likely plant material would be grasses like Poa species and early successional dicotoledonous species, maybe clover. If you had a local source for stone or gravel, that would have likely been scattered for convenience of not walking in mud. Livestock would have grazed perimeter areas beyond your wall. You might have had tenant farmers or laborers manage cereal grains or fruit orchards beyond those walls. I am sure that the distance that “lawn” extended would vary greatly with land holdings, status, terrain, local flora (deciduous forest vs steppe vs jungle, immense variation even in northern Europe).
Oh hell no. Geese can be very good watch dogs. Honking to raise alarm. Also they can be territorial and aggressive. If a goose comes at you hissing (yes they hiss) and wings half spread to peck and beat you with, the better part of Valor is to leave.
