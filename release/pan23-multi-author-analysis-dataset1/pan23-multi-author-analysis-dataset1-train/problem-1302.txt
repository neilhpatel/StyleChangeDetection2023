In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
PS. We should probably both keep in mind that we are mostly in agreement, morally the act was terrible. We're only discussing if this one point is truly a crime .

The term generally used by immigration officers and people who work in immigration-related fields is “pending asylee” rather than “asylum seeker” and the term in relevant law is usually “applicant for asylum” or some similar combination of “applicant”” and/or “asylum” depending on the specific context.
No, they aren't. I'm sorry, you're just wrong here. You even linked a site that completely contradicts what you're saying here. There is an entire spectrum of possibilities between "completely unauthorized (undocumented)" and a citizen. The people who are held in facilities are people who are awaiting their removal hearing, waiting for their asylum application to move to pending status (which wasn't these folks) or undocumented minors.
Yes, they are. They are 'undocumented', the fact that they seek documentation through proper channels does not make them legal immigrants. There exists no special exemption for 'asylum seekers' and transporting them across state lines is, indeed, a federal crime.
There is no provision or exception for 'asylum seekers', in fact the term 'asylum seekers' doesn't even appear in our laws, it is a spin term itself. What he did was, in fact and by legal definition a crime.
