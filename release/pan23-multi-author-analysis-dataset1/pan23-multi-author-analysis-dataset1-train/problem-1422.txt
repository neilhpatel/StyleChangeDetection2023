I just went over my insurance documents and BMW isn't listed anywhere on anything. The policy even explicitly states that settlement amount will be paid to "insured" (me) for the "owned vehicle" (that BMW FS owned), while differentiating the "insured" from the "owner" (BMW FS).
So the "payoff" is an amount quoted to me by BMW FS to purchase the car as-is, which terminates the lease and initiates title change from BMW FS to me. It's roughly equivalent to the residual value we had agreed upon for lease terms plus (14 months remaining on the lease)x($X monthly lease payment amount), plus like another $1k in various fees. That total was $49k.
Honestly if you didn't consult them/lender before accepting the settlement, I wouldn't be surprised if they pursue additional action against you for additional monies owed.
I'm not sure about it. That's why I'm asking. Its hard for me to believe I'm the first person this has happened to, so I was hoping someone else had some experience in an analogous situation.
