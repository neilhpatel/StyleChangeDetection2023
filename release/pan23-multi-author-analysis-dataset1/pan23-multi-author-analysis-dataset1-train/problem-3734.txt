When they bought the property your lease with the old owner is no longer valid. Sucks yes but you became a month to month tenant at that point. It would have been the decent thing to do to give you more notice. I would have never done that to a tenant. They own the property that your renting so they can take down any fencing they want. The keyword there is THEY. It's not stated in a lease because right now there is no lease. They're bullying you and taking advantage of your ignorance. Document everything with dates and possibly times. Take pictures. Read up on NYS (not NYC they have different laws) tentant rights. The legal jargon is awful but Google is an amazing friend. P.
