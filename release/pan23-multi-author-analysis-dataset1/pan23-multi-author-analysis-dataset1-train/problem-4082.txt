Yeah time to go above the authorities of the building to the actual people who enforce regulations. A few citations and your building management will get to fixing things. That said, sound like nightmare neighbors so absolutely do what you need to to get this fixed. But also get ready for more bullshit.
The "mixing valve" explanation is particularly suspect. A mixing valve takes in hot and cold water, and directs the flow through an outlet valve of warm water. Even if a mixing valve is turned all the way to the hot side, it can only pull as much hot water as the outlet needs. For example, the mixing valve in your shower only pulls enough hot water to ensure you get a nice warm shower (in theory), and when you're not showering, no water flows through it at all. Unless you're hearing water running at all hours, or seeing them throw out bucket after bucket of water, they probably aren't using enough water to interfere with the other units.
It sounds like the problem may be more an issue of inadequate supply - unless there's something in the condo rules limiting how much hot water each unit can use, your neighbours aren't doing anything legally wrongful in making heavy use of the hot water. If that's true, then it might also be true that your water is running poorly because they're using a lot of hot water, but that might not be your neighbour's problem. The other thing it could be, if the issue is specific to your unit but triggered by demand in a neighbouring unit, is an issue in the plumbing between the units - mineral deposits in the pipes or something - that limit the total amount of water below what it should be.
