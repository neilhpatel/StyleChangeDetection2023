I was reading the wiki about the battle Crecy, and it said that Edward had taken up a defensive position up on a hill and awaited the French attack. His longbowmen routed the French crossbows, then France launched the cavalry, that got destroyed by retreating crossbowmen, charging uphill, and from pits dug by the English (that whole situation is hilarious). So I was thinking maybe this battle didn't play out so much as a pitched battle. But then I looked up Crecy on Google Maps. And it has to be the flattest place I've every seen. And I'm from the Great Plains (an especially flat place in the Great Plains as well). I'm sure 700 years of human settlement will completely reshape the land though. I would still say an impromptu fortification, along with cavalry charges would definitely fit the definition of a pitched battle. Even in forests.
de Rither was in Lithuania along Sir Geoffrey Scrope as members of Henry Bolingbroke's (eventually Henry IV of England) crusading expedition to assist the Teutonic Knights with their perpetual conflicts in the Baltics. They participated in the siege of Vilnius (de Rither calls it Wellon), where Sir Geoffrey died, but failed to take the city. Chris Given-Wilson's and Ian Mortimer's biographies of Henry IV both talk about these crusading efforts. There's probably more detailed accounts of the siege of Vilnius in scholarship on the Teutonic Knights, but I haven't studied them at all, so unfortunately I don't know any offhand to recommend.
