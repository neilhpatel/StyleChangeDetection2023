"From the perspective of the longue durée, one can actually see the true medieval stasis to be... The Roman Republic and The Roman Empire. For all its status in the early modern, enlightened and romantic imaginary as a modernizing and civilizing force in Europe, there was nothing in terms of advancement in science and mathematics.".
Now and again there were attempts to restore the Imperial University and attempts reforms of the recruitment system be it the commission under Emperor Shun, Emperor Ling's new School at the Gate of the Vast Capital for those of rhapsody talent, Chen Qun's Nine Grades or Xiahou Xuan's urged reforms to get powers out from the local families.
I see the issue with my post was phrasing and I should've quoted the specific part in mind. I'll go ahead and quote it.
Later Han initially relied on a small core professional "Northern Army" (including a unit of Wuhuan cavalry) based around the capital and use of convicts and volunteers for the non-capital forces of around 15,000 while what troops were raised locally for crises and local militia dragged from the inner commandries (though lack of training and willingness of said levies could become a major problem) and mercenaries hired from abroad. For a local internal campaign, the ability to raise across commandries could give numbers, the Han would have the equipment and one of the five Northern Army Regiments would give an elite backbone. However when fighting in the north, sometimes the use of allied troops for major offensive expeditions greatly outnumbered the Han's troops.
