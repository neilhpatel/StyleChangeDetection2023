EDIT: That’s all the time we have for today We’ll continue to scan this thread periodically for more questions to answer when we’re available. Thanks again to the sub and its mods for joining us for another fun session. Till next time - Angel (Washinon Post Reddit guy).
In 2020 the polling suggested that Trump and Biden would have a tight race (which they did, sort of) but also that the Democratic party would pick up something like five seats in the Senate and win a clear majority, instead we saw Republicans voting for Biden at the top of the ticket and voting for Republicans at the bottom of the ticket, and the Senate ended up with a 50/50 tie.
Hi! I actually just voted for Warnock about an hour ago. . My question: to what degree do you think the current statewide political landscape is directly attributable to Donald Trump turning off so many moderate Republican voters? I do not understand how the state went from having uniform Republican control statewide to having Senators like Warnock and Ossoff in such a short amount of time.
