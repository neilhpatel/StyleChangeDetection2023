I don't think it's that easy. Russia enriches more than half of the world's uranium and today exports 15% of the US' total uranium purchases. The world's largest producer (Kazakhstan) is a landlocked former Soviet state that moves its uranium through Russia's borders.
Regardless, the world's largest enrichment facilities are in Russia. They are expensive and take many years to build - the US only has one enrichment facility itself. For the foreseeable future, Russia is a major player with nuclear power generation.
