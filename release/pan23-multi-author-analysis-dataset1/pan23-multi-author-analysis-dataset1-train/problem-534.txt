Solutions don't need to be creative. The two options are governments tell FIFA to fuck off, or citizens stop watching. Those are the only two options. Complaining about it and then giving FIFA money and saying "we can't just not give them our money" is part of the problem. Yes, 100s of millions of people need to stop watching. too fucking bad. Would you say this if we had televised concentration camps? "Oh well Hilter should stop rounding up all the jews, but it's our favorite sport, so oh well nothing to do about it, can't just tell everybody to stop watching televised concentration camps.".
Edit: and before anyone accuses me of crediting the entirety of the Ukrainian resistance to Zelenskyy, himself, Iâ€™m obviously not. Stop it.
Ok, what about the Ethiopian war, or the Israel/Palestinian conflict, or let's talk about China and the Uighers or the Australian Island Prisons, or Black Lives Matter, or the Hijab issue in France, or let's talk about the Karabakh conflict, we can keep going and find every issue with every country.
