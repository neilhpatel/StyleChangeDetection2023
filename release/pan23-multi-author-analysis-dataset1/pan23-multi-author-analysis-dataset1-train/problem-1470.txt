The court didn't order us to talk through the app though, it was a decision made after I had to call the police because they were refusing to hand over my son during pick up and even had him at a different location, I had to pick him up from someone else's house that day. The police officer on site suggested that we use it and at first my ex did not agree but then said he would use it to show how I do not communicate properly with him. Do you think I could still block his number and only force him to talk through TalkingParents ? Thank you!
California does allow for the use of FamilyWizard for communication in situation like this, but I'm not familiar enough with it to say whether it can be activated without going to court. You might try calling your court to ask about FamilyWizard or similar communication methods. If you have to go back to court to modify your orders, you can at that point explain that girlfriend (who is probably not constrained by the custody order at this point) has been interfering by doing X, Y, Z... etc. and see what the judge says at that point.
if it's not in the court order, maybe not. But you could mention in court that your ex agreed informally to do so, and you want all communication to go through that going forward, period. In the interim, ignore anything they send that isn't strictly related to when and where to make exchanges, and any decisions like medical, etc that are mandated in the court order. I know it's easy to say "just ignore the rude comments about parenting style" but you want to have the cleaner hands in this.
