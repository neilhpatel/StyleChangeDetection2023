Get out there and talk about helping the working people unionize and raise wages, tax these corporations.....I'd love to see a 21st Century WPA style program, start the recruiting in the Rust Belt and Appalachia, help those steel workers and coal miners get retrained to build bridges and rail and tunnels that we need, set them up building solar and wind farms, paving roads and repairing dams and all the other infrastructure shit we desperately need......Direct Action on this shit is far better than all these crazy tax credits and underfunded programs and and complex grants and shit you have to sign up for.
