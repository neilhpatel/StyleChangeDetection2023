This led to also changing Russia's third largest city and gate to Siberia, from the Imperial Yekaterinburg to Sverdlovsk, named after the first Secretary of the Communist Party during the Revolution and Civil War, and founding member of the Politburo Yakov Sverdlov, who had died in 1919.
Not sure if I'm allowed to comment here but I'll give it a try. Short answer; the 20th century was an incredibly volatile time in Russian history. There were several major regime changes and each regime renamed some of the cities in order to symbolize that they were breaking from the past and "restarting" for lack of better word. I'm addressing each example below.
However some did not: as noted above the oblast (region/province) that Yekaterinburg is located in is still named Sverdlovsk, and the same is true for Saint Petersburg: the oblast around the city retained the name Leningrad, which is in part because in 1991 there was a city-wide referendum on the name, and it was voted to restore it to Saint Petersburg. The oblast was not part of the vote, so never changed, and there hasn't been any pressure to do so since then.
