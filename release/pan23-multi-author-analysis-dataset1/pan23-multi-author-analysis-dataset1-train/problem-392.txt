All it means is that a persons hard work can create generational wealth and that should be viewed positively. That’s what I want to do, make sure my kids have a great life.
You sound like someone in a low paying job, getting yelled at every day by the boss's incompetent brother-in-law, but defends the boss and the fed-up situation against the coworkers who want things to change, because he has been worked to the bone and it is easier to vent at them than the people responsible for your misery.
I have no problem with it whatsoever. Yes I think it’s fine. It’s their business and they can hire whoever they want, as long as it isn’t an illegal hiring practice. If the business habitually places unqualified people into positions of importance it will not be successful and eventually will fail. If I am passed up for promotion I can exercise any of the numerous choices available to me. I don’t feel like my employer owes me advancement, they don’t owe me loyalty, I am 100% accountable for my career and earnings. If I were so stupid as to rely on someone else for my families well being than I’m reckless and irresponsible.
