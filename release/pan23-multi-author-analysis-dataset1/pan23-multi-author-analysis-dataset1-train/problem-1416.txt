Depending on how public the incident was among your coworkers, the manager will probably try to do one of two things: Save face or remove the threat to their job. Sometimes both. If you find a non-retaliate policy, contact HR and explain the situation. They might reverse the order and have more evidence to fire the jerk. If you are terminated, a lot of companies will offer to write you a check for 2 weeks - 1 month’s pay in exchange for your signing a release document. I understand that your decision here will be dependent on your financial situation. But— and if you get nothing else from this post, I hope this is it— if you intend to take legal action against the company in the future, I cannot advise you strongly enough NOT to sign that document. It often contains a covenant not to sue, which kills your case before it even begins.
Super dangerous. Even if you feel fine in the moment, they can cause life threatening damage (i.e. right now you're fine, in a few hours you're dead). Anytime you are strangled, you should immediately go to the ER (or possibly urgent care) for assessment and treatment if necessary.
