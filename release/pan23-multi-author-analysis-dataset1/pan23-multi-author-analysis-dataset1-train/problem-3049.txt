Aside from the claims themselves, which are obviously quite troublesome, to vastly understate it (not my intention of course; better writes have explained the issues), my biggest surprise was that Harvard has a professor of Japanese legal studies.

So I'm fleshing out the maps for a naval encounter in my fantasy series. I'll try not to get too heavy with the details, but basically imagine that a fleet of Greek triremes had to row upriver to secure something approximating the China's Grand Canal during the Ming Restoration. In researching how battle like this might play out I've come across a ton of fantastic resources for everything from the kinds of formations the Athenians used to the effects rowing upriver would have in various currents, but there is one fairly simple question that I cannot seem to find an answer to: when ancient triremes were rowing in formation, how much distance was there between each ship?
