It's that they extremely dislike socialism of any kind, due to their poor experiences in Cuba. The feeling I get is that even the perception of socialism is enough to put them against something. So, they vote very heavily for the GOP, and the party is afraid that if they lifted the embargo, that Florida would become a swing state again.
The GOP won't do it because they'd lose Florida, with all of its anti-Castro Cubans. The Dems won't do it because they'd be accused of being communist, which would sway centrists they rely on to win still.
For both of those things, you can check out the UNCTAD reports on Cuba, both tackling the extraterrioriality of the sanctions, the ways in which they make it difficult for cuba to import nescessary goods, and also this by fairfield university, which yes, is outdated in a lot of ways, but will show to you some of the concerns that are still applicable in relation to extraterritoriality and enforcement, and then also show you that it wasn't just "18 months", but rather that directly or indirectly restricting Cuba's access to dollars was a feature of the embargo for several administrations.
