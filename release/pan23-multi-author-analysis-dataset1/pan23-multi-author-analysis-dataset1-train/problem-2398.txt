I mean sure, but the folder alone isn't evidence of that. If he claims he took the folders home because he thought they were neat, that isn't an admission of a crime. The files are usually shredded or burned shortly after use, so their absence isn't likely much of an indicator of anything.
Also you know they usually shred/burn whats in the folders, but often not the folders (they dont fit in crosscuts so well, and maybe get reused). So its not that outlandish.
So I get the etiquette and all, but I’ll continue to dis and deride him every chance I get just like he dissed our country’s veterans, people of color from “shithole” nations, immigrants trying to make a better life, the disabled, women, and anyone else who was, for whatever unfortunate reason, susceptible to the gravitational pull of the world’s biggest asshole.
That we do not know. But him saying he took home empty folders isnt a confession and their discovery alone is not evidence of a crime. Anyone telling you otherwise is lying to you.
When Trump was subpoenaed for documents in the NY AG's lawsuit, a document search consultant team led by his NJ attorney Alina Habba searched Trump Org files and computers as well as all of Trump's properties, including his residence and office at Mar-a-Lago. They generated a thorough and extensive production and a believable affidavit that they had complied thoroughly.
