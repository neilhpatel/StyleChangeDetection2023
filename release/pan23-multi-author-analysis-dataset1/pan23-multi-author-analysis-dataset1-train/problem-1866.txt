This was very helpful and scary to read, i reached out to my manager and told my parents. The sheriffs department collected clothing evidence that had dna and took pictures and a detective is gonna talk to me next week. In the mean time i will look at what you suggested and try to go about doing those things. Once again thank you, i don't really know who else to turn to so reddit seemed like a solid option and you all did not let me down at all. I feel hopeful.
This was definitely rape, you did not consent, he 100% knew you weren’t consenting (he was not holding you in headlocks and the like for no reason- he knew you were vulnerable, that we’re an easy target population, and went after you, physically assaulted you, and raped you.).
When you are searching for a legal advocate, I would express that you are primarily looking for help with getting an order of protection, social work needs, and with getting through the criminal justice process. Good luck!
Your parents being too depressed is bullshit, they weren’t the victims in this, but I’ve been a victim too and I didn’t even tell my parents about my rape for fear of their mental health (talking about my multiple assaults that weren’t rape was bad enough, you know?).
When you get that situated, you may want to pursue a civil claim against him (lawsuit or pre-suit settlement), and so you eventually may ask the advocate for a referral for that type of lawyer and find out the statute of limitations (deadline you must file by). You will likely have time for all of that.
