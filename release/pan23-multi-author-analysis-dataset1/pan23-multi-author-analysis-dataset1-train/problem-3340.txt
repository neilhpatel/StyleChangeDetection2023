Guys. Put your Pro Israel or Pro Palestine biased aside. If there will be anything resembling peace people need call a spade a spade. When Israel does something bad lets call them out. This particular incident. You have to to be crazy not to believe the guy did not deserve to get shot. Heck in the US someone reaching for the cops gun and you will get shot.
The U.N. representative in this story is basically saying, "it's unfair that Israel vastly outguns, is overwhelmingly better militarily trained, has near infinitely more money and resources than Palestine- and I believe because of these things Israeli soldiers should not defend themselves against rogue attacks, and that Israel should not build missile defense systems- their citizens should just accept the bombs with open arms. Because it's not fair! [insert crying baby noises].".
The UN has a long history of bias against Israel while totally overlooking the actions of its neighbors, all violent, autocratic monarchies and dictatorships guilty of numerous human rights violations and war crimes.
