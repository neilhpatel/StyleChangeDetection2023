First you off you sort of can't because a nuclear weapon isn't just some wires strapped to uranium. It takes exacting precision to start the chain reaction for fission/fusion and the well nuclear yields. Without that its just a dirty bomb. Heck some designs will even start decaying rapidly . And just you know being radioactive tends to require special measures, even if your heartless regime only cares about safety to keep people from spilling the beans. When openly dealing arms you could support all the logistics and training in an ongoing client relationship, but keeping that up in secret is another beast entirely. Consider that while not given nukes exactly it is the worst kept "secret" in geopolitics is that Israel has nukes and the West helped in various ways.
Do inspectors actually get the opportunity to determine operational status? if not Russia could have sold off the tritium years ago, and their entire stockpile is about as useful as a t72.
Exactly. If they aren't maintaining the hardware that people can see and they know they will use, they definitely aren't maintaining the expensive stuff that the public never sees and may never get used.
lol. Its russia. They are not honorable, and in fact they're a deceitful, untrustworthy country. Of course they won't honor agreements whilst engaged in an illegal war.
