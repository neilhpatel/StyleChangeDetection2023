Actually joining Russia has obviously been a bad idea for some time now, but if you are craven and small you can't afford to actually to defy them. So you create internal problems by shooting your mouth off to show you're on Putin's side without actually doing anything constructive to help him. This way you play both sides.
BAHAHAHAHHA, Okay. Russia does make a fair few missiles the whole "running out" thing is incorrect. They have reached the hand to mouth point already and it reduces the tactical flexibility of Russia.
Absolutely. Their biggest international action lately has been to pick some fights (about nothing — license plates in one case) with its neighbors, making them conveniently too busy to help Putin. Just like Luka.
Towards these goals, Gerasimov‘s new plans involve tens of thousands of new troops, accumulated 70-80,00 thus far; that they’ve ‘starved’ deployed units and PMCs of ammunition, in order to stockpile for new campaign; and crucially, new plans finally involve “demilitarization,” which Gerasimov says requires taking or at least attacking western Ukraine in order to end the supply of western weapons, and thus there’s a large buildup of Russian troops in Western Belarus.
