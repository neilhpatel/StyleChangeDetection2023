__CORRECTION::__ 63% of Millennials/Gen Z’ers voted for Democrats. If only 25% of this demo voted for Republicans, this mathematically mean that 75% voted against Republicans; which should also include independent candidates. The other 12% consists of votes for candidates like Evan McMullin of Utah, and Chase Oliver of Georgia.

Prior to the Reagan administration, Christian churches typically voted Democrat. The strategy for Republicans to embrace evangelicals for the vote started in that time. Ever heard of Kennedy Catholics?
Guarantee you that at least 63% of Millennials and Gen Z’ers (the percentage nationwide who voted against Republicans in the 2022 Midterms, with only 25% of those same age demos voting for Republican) will be turned off by someone if that person declared to be a devout Christian in the political arena.
Jesus taught to give to the poor and disabled. Republicans vote and campaign against supporting the poor and disabled. Jesus literally condemned being wealthy.
