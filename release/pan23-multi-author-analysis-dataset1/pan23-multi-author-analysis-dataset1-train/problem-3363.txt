Because the US constantly threatened Cuba with nuclear annihilation and is the only country on earth that has shown they would use nuclear weapons on civilian population centers. Is it really that hard to wrap your brain around? The US was the aggressor and you’re fucking propagandized so far up your own ass to think that Cuba was the aggressor and was doing anything at all besides being communist and acting in self-defense. The entire history of the US is the story of imperialism in the global south. Asking for nuclear deterrent against what would have been an assured invasion by US forces is literally the only reason there’s not a fascist dictator ruling Cuba and dropping dissidents out of helicopters today. Castro asking for a nuclear deterrent saved his country and its citizens. Fuck off with that stupid ass fucking argument now.
Fantastic. Not a Lula supporter specifically, I am not unaware of the corruption that occurred during his previous administration, but this will be good for everyone. Hard not to be delighted about it.
