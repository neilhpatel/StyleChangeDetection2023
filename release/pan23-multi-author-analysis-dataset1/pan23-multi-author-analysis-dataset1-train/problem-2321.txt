As far as I can tell, yes. Tibet wasn't really much taken into account considering the Domino Theory, and when it fell to the People's Republic of China in 1950, Americans were a bit more focused on what was going on in Korea, if they were focused on it at all. It's worth remembering the anecdote that Secretary of State Dean Acheson asked for a map when he was informed that the Communists had invaded south Korea and he asked, "Where is that?".
To add to what u/JimeDorje has written about the practical issues, another factor that contributed to American inaction was that the US had already acknowledged China's sovereignty over Tibet during WWII - this was something that Chiang Kai-shek pushed for and got. The British had acknowledged China's sovereignty decades earlier. Neither the US nor the UK had recognised Tibet as a sovereign state. In part, this was because Tibet had not sought such recognition since they had declared themselves independent of China with the fall of the Qing Dynasty until after WWII, at which point Tibet could not be recognised without alienating the Republic of China and breaking wartime promises to Chiang Kai-shek.
My point was that in 1946 when Tibet first sought international recognition, Chiang Kai-shek had not yet lost, which made it problematic for the US to recognise Tibet.
In the old agreements between the British and the Qing, the British had recognised China's sovereignty over Tibet, and the Qing had recognised the right of Tibet to autonomy. The ROC was prepared to work on these lines, and in the 1947 constitution, Article 120 read.
