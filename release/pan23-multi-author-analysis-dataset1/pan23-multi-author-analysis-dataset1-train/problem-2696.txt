So, back to Chernobyl. The problem they were trying to solve was the graphite was extremely radioactive. They attempted to use robots to solve the problem but they all failed in the intense radiation fields. The exact strenhs of the radiation fields varied wildly around the site, and with them the amount of protection you'd need, although the sites contaminated with graphite were so radioactive with beta and gamma emitters that the shielding required would have made movement so slow as to be more or less impossible.
Thank you so much for the answer. I inferred from my own readings after the show that they wanted to prioritize speed over complete safety in disposing of the debris, and this serves as a good confirmation of it. Many thanks to you!
Given that the body can take some radiation, the decision was made that it was better to use thousands and thousands of men (the so-called "liquidators"), each with only a few seconds or minutes of exposure, depending on their job. Given this, and what I described above about dose, the priorities were speed, and keeping radioactive dust off of the body and lungs.
