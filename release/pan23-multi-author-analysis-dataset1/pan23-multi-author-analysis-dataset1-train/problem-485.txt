More modern translations of this passage frequently translate the Latin word "lucifer" as "morning star" (NIV) or as "Day Star" (NRSV), whereas the KJV translates it as the proper name "Lucifer"--I've used the KJV here because the translation of "lucifer" as a proper name most clearly illustrates the connection that some claim between these two passages.
What do you mean? That is the biblical Lucifer: an astral figure cast down from Zaphon, a Canaanite legend that is used as a metaphor for King Nebuchadrezzar. This is the only time in the Bible where “Lucifer” (helel ben sahar) is mentioned.
Lucifer qui mane oriebaris is the Latin translation of the Hebrew hȇlēl ben šāḥar. The LXX renders the name ἑωσφόρος ὁ πρωὶ ἀνατέλλων. The literal translations are: "the Morning Star, that rose in the morning" (LXX), "The Morning Star, that used to rise in the morning" (Vulgate), and "Day Star, son of Dawn" (NRSV) in Hebrew. This refers to the planet Venus, which rose before dawn and was called Lucifer in Latin. The idea that Dawn begets the morning star is found in classical literature, where Eos (called Erigineia, "Early-born", an epithet for 'Dawn') "brought forth... the Star Eosphoros".
