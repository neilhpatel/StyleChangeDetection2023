The flying doctor and bush aid station resources are a really neat system if anyone is wondering. I mean things are a bit different now with teleconferencing and better cellular networks, but there's still a lot of Aussie bush that's very....out there. And then you gotta think - how does someone WAY out there get immediate care? Heck, how do they get responsive/preventative care that's not currently emergency? And then you realize that communication has taken big leaps and bounds in recent years....how'd they do all this 25 years ago? To answer all those questions - much like other successful endeavors in humanity, collaborating human brains make the impossible happen.

Basically that a native person must be having another kid since they get a free ride and healthcare. Eerily similar.
He was homeschooled, went to private schools, and went to West Point. Skull and bones doesn't come into play on this one. The one thing I will say about him is that he is sincere in his beliefs and will not compromise them, even for political gain and public acceptance. Those beliefs are morally reprehensible of course, but he sincerely holds them.
