'Under Minnesota statute, it is “legal to record an oral or telephone conversation with the consent of one or more parties, provided there was no criminal or tortious intent. Unauthorized recording in violation of this law can lead to jail time, fines, and/or civil liability.” See Min. Stat. 626A.02'.
There are usually protections from being recorded where privacy is reasonably expected. Even in a one party state, if you start trying to record in a bathroom, it's illegal. A bedroom, too. The living room and kitchen are a bit more iffy. Like if I was in your living room with you, I could record our conversation, but I can't set up a device in your living room to record you without actually being a part of a conversation. And you actually have to give me permission to be in your living room. If I open your door without permission and walk in without permission, then you still have a reasonable expectation of privacy in your living room, and it would be illegal for me to record. I could record the sounds coming from your living room while outside of your house on a public sidewalk, though.
