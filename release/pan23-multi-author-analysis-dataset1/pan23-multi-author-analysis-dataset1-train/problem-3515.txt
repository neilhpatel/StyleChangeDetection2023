This meant folks that work for a high-paying company in California or New York would then move to a rural/sparsely populated state like Iowa to live and maximize their income. This had the adverse effect of skyrocketing mortgages/rents in the area, making things worse for Iowan natives. The same can be applied to other areas, sadly.
Many Americans would be better off paying the “higher” European taxes than they are paying 20-30% plus state income tax (applicable in all but 4 states), plus city taxes, plus county taxes, plus the cost of private for-profit health insurance, plus the cost of deductibles, plus the cost of co-insurance which is what we pay after the deductible, usually 20-30% of the total bill, plus the cost of co-pays, plus the cost of being forced to use vertically integrated pharmacies owned by the health insurance entities, plus the generally ridiculous cost of medicine.
What ? The 2010's were incredible in the USA; job market, salary's, all exploded. Most people I know double their salary from 2008 to today; I took a new job in 2009, was only making about $120,000 per year, but I am a little more than double that today.
