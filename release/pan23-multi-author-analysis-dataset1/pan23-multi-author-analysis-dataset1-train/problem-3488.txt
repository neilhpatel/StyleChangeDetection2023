Rafale’s powerful Spectra Electronic warfare suite not only attacked but also jammed Su-35 BAR phased array radar successfully multiple times, rendering Su-35 blind in the sky, later following it up being shot down by the Rafale in mock Beyond visual range dogfights.

Oh. Thank you for the jets. What do you mean they have no engines? Where are the parts you promised? Why do all of the boxes say "Made in China" on them? Seriously? all the training pilots were killed in Ukraine?
Its cheaper for Iran to acquire for obvious reasons, they probably couldn’t get F-22s or F-35s if they wanted to, judging by American performance in Afghanistan and Vietnam, overwhelming air superiority doesn’t seem like it can decisively crush insurgencies anyway, and you stated that your judgement of Iran’s acquisition of the SU-35 was because they may face NATO fighters in the future.
