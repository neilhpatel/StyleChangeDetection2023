"Boudica (or Boadicea) is well known today, but the lack of hard evidence for her existence and legendary struggle against Rome is astonishing. For historical accounts of Boudica, we are reliant on brief passages from the ancient authors Tacitus and Cassius Dio, neither of whom were contemporaries of the Boudican Rebellion. Each of these historians wrote entirely from a Roman perspective and both had a ‘spin’ on the episode – an agenda or interpretative prism through which they were seeking to present their account.".
I'd rather say "no extant contemporary references" since some of those who took part to his expedition wrote down first hand accounts (Callisthenes, Nearchus), and other historians like Timagenes used these as sources just a few years after Alexander's death.
Thanks. I was asking because in my arguments with Jesus Mythicists I point to Boudica as an example of someone who existed but has no contemporary references. Someone in response expressed doubt over whether Boudica existed, so I wanted to double check with you guys.
