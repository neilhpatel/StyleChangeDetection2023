So even if we have loads of records of people who did write, it's very hard to tell how many other people there were who we don't know about it. It's a sampling bias problem that's very hard to deal with.
Never underestimate the ingenuity of scholars in finding quantitative proxies. While there were no "censuses of reading ability" -- we have an enormous body of legal documents and financial, which often demonstrate whether a particular individual could sign his own name, a marker for the most basic literacy. This gives us a very nice time series for historical literacy, and can be further be broken down by gender and class (since early legal documents often mention individuals' occupations.
