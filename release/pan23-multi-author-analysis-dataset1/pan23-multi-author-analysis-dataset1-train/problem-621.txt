Took a break from non fiction after "Why Dinosaurs Mattered" and worked through some sci fi, but I'm back in the saddle. Reading through @war by Shane Harris on the rise of cyberwar and fighting on the internet. Good stuff so far, although I'm not super taken by the writing style.
Lennart Samuelson, Plans for Stalin's War Machine: Tukhachevskii and Military-Economic Planning, 1925-1941, mostly for getting a holistic sense of the strategic & operational thinking and the institutional attitudes that drove the requirements for technological objects like tanks and planes.
Thank you for this. For context I'm writing about soviet vehicles used on Soviet, now Russian, bases in Antarctica and I want to touch briefly on why a lot of equipment are still used 30, 40 even 50 years after it arrived. Some of it comes down to funding but there is something to be said for the sheer longevity of the vehicles in use out there and I wanted to find some quotes or info about design practices around heavy machinery that might help explain some of that. most for the equipment is adapted from military gear hence why I thought military comparisons may be easier to find.
