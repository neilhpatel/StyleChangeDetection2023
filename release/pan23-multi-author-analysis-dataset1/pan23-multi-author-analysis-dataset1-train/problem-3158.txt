In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
But really? I think the biggest factor is that college introduces people to other cultures, races, and mindsets. As Mark Twain said:
Being wealthy is a much more deciding factor of how your life is gonna play out and what policies you're going to tend to support (at least economically, as those are the non-culture war policies that actually matter), because you have a vested interest in keeping taxes low and the market as rigged in the favor of business and land owners as possible.
Not really. The initial statement was that republicans are brain washed because they lack critical thinking skills. I would like you to put that theory to the test.
