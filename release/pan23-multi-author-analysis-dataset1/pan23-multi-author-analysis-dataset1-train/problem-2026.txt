Many Western historians would, I think, certainly dispute the claims of "real" Mongol invincibility after the decline of the Mongol Empire—at least past the fifteenth century. You bring up Timur's campaigns against the Ottomans, but not his wars with Toqtamysh in 1391 and '95—or, even more relevantly, the failure of the Chaghatay Khanate to maintain a hold on Transoxiana earlier in the century. (It's important to remember that while Timur came of nomad stock, his power really rested on the sedentary population of Transoxiana—and if you can make the argument that his troops were more nomadic than those of the Ottomans, there were states still more nomadic than his.) Quite a bit later, and on the China side, the Battle of Jao Modo in 1696 showed that the Qing Empire was decisively able to hold its Inner Asian frontiers.
Is Khrapachevsky raising the argument of political unity/disunity? Because that's the obvious difference between the imperial and preceeding and following periods of the steppe.
He does. He clearly stated that it's pretty obvious that Mongol defeats grow very fast as the time flows and they become more and more divided IIRC.
