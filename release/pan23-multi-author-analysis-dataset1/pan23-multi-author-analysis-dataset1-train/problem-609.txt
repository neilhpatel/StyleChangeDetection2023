_Probably not_. Psychological problems can be grounds for someone to be found to be incompetent, but it tends to only happen for extreme cases - delusional disorders, severe schizophrenia, dementia, and the like. Mood disorders or an addiction generally won't do it.
Interesting. Thank you for your help. Tbh, he didn't have much to do with the wedding. He just showed up and said some stuff the day of.
The kinds of incapacity that would invalidate a marriage tend to also be the kinds of incapacity where someone is not able to stand there and say "I do," either because they can't follow the proceeding or because they're catatonic. If his conditions, whatever they are, were under control enough to plan a marriage for longer than five minutes, he was probably competent enough to marry. It's a very, very low bar.
Interesting. I didn't realize how severe the issues were at the time of our marriage. I figured a lot of them were situational (where he lived, worked, etc) causing unnecessary anger and depression. However, both of us now think he may have bipolar disorder because his moods are all over the place. I'm not sure if this type of mood disorder would be grounds for annulment, especially since he hasn't been diagnosed (due to lack of getting help).
