-For states that possess nuclear weapons and states not in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations, there remains a narrow range of contingencies in which U.S. nuclear weapons may still play a role in deterring a conventional, chemical, or biological weapons attack against the United States or its allies and partners, as stated in the 2010 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review (NPR).
-in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies, and also.
-in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.
The second point is the nuclear response to a non-nuclear attack for Russia. In previous public discussions regarding this point it was in regards too: "underlined the threat posed by a disarming strike that uses non-nuclear, high-precision weapons against key sites of Russia’s military infrastructure and deterance, telling a meeting of the 2015 Valdai Club that such weapons are “comparable in their effect to nuclear weapons.”.
No, they didn’t have a first strike doctrine. They assumed the possibility of nuclear response after being attacked either with nuclear means, or conventional arms to a degree where existence of the state is threatened. This is quite literally not the first strike.
