I think that even if they lost 2m people over 10 years, nothing would happen unfortunately. Average Russia mindset is just "da, at least it isn't three million". Russians have internalized pain and suffering to such a high degree that it's insane. They never had a good government, never had compassionate society and never cultured the idea of existence on mutually beneficial terms. It's just hardship and human misery all the way down.

The resolution isn't as good as some of the very high res commercial satellite data, but on the one hand Copernicus Sentinel satellites aren't intended for pure visual photography, but they won't cost you an arm and an leg like Maxar or Planet and like would.
That's not likely true. Russia has a big demographics issue with a shrinking population, esp towards the younger generations. They can't afford to throw 2m young men to their deaths.
