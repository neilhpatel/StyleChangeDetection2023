I'm a non-religious conservative republican. So...a Democrat because of the two-party system. I can't allow our personal freedoms to be removed just because a magical sky fairy might not like it. I'm also a Army veteran that served to protect freedom of religion. May sound naive but it's one of the reasons I joined.

Ironically, there is a good scholarly argument that the verse from Leviticus that most Western Bibles translate as condemning homosexuality (man lying with man) may have actually originally been a condemnation of pederasty and child molestation. Not homosexuality. It was condemning the practices of the Canaanites and their practices and telling Jewish people not to engage in those things. One lurid religious practice of Canaanites who were part of the Cult of Molech was to molest young boys (pederasty) before making blood acrificing to idols of Molech. Leviticus may have been condemning pedrasty rather than homosexual between adults. Notice there is no mention or condemnation of female homosexuality.
