China's claimed defense spending numbers aren't remotely accurate. And given the age of their forces, they put a much higher percentage of their budget into acquisitions than the US or allies who have older systems that require more maintenance. There's more nuance to this than is often acknowledged. Plus, understand that the likely point of conflict is taiwan. Because of the proximity to China and the other responsibilities the US maintains, the mission of the US & its allies is to be able to fight and win on the opponents home turf while managing extended supply lines & maintaining deterrent forces in other theaters. That mission requires more forces than simply blockading or seizing taiwan & defending their amphibious & expeditionary forces from US & allied intervention.
So it seems like we did great. The Russian invasion was so incredibly stupid that no one actually expected it, and yet we were still able to respond almost immediately. One Ukraine blunted the initial assault, the West could resupply.
