These are not Norse Gods, per se. The names of the gods associated with the days of the week have been localized to refer to Germanic gods instead of Roman gods, with the exception of Saturday. Interestingly, the name Sunday was preserved, with its reference to the sun as it is in Latin, diēs Sōlis (the Day of the Sun), as opposed to the modern Romance name diēs Dominicus (the Day of the Lord). Showing that it was adopted before the shift in nomenclature to reflect Christian values in the Roman Empire.
Now, on the other hand, the days of the months were not influenced by Roman nomenclature until later on and spread with the influence of the Roman Christian church throughout the first millennium AD. Germanic month names in English were common until the Medieval Period, but they lasted longer in other Germanic languages. The names of the months we use now were actually borrowed directly from Latin and replaced the Norman French terms used during Middle English; January is a lot closer to Latin Iānuārius than French Janvier.
Thanks for the thorough answer. Your response regarding the naming of the months is fascinating because clearly there was a decision made to adopt the entirely Latin names for months but keep the proto-germanic names for the days of the week.
