Currently, as it is just a script, it requires Grease Monkey or Tamper Monkey (either works for Firefox, the latter only for Chrome) to run. If it proves useful and there are future versions, hopefully it will have an easier implementation, but for now, I'd suggest having some familiarity with how to use those extensions if you are interested in giving it a whirl.
Seems to be. It feels unearned, and it fucks up my summer plans (plus I have to take my comps much earlier than I was expecting), but in the end I shouldn't complain. Things usually work out.
You haven't lived until your work on the origins of racial psuedoscience, an the need to order reprints of key works that aren't available in the public domain because they're objectionable, has brought you to the attention of Nazi-wannabe sellers who start trying to contact you as a recruitment effort. One of my colleagues had to deal with that. I do not envy him, but at least he was smart enough to use a different address and not his real full name.
