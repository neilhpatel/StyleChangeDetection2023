This is correct. Americans need to wake up to the fact that the Republican Party turning on Trump does not mean that Republicans have given up on the brand of fascism created by Trump. Republicans turning on Trump doesn't mean they have suddenly seen the light and are going to renounce Trump's version of fascism. On the contrary. If Republicans keep loosing elections they are not going to give up on their dream of taking total control of America. Instead, if Republicans continue to loose elections, they will give up on democracy instead and go all in on seizing power through violent revolution instead.
