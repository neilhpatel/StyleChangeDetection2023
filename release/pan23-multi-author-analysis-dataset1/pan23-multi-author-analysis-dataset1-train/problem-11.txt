Yeah I only recorded it after I opened the can and pulled out little chunks of hair, afterwards pouring it into a Tupperware and using a fork to show the hair. I still have the van but I see what you mean.
Happy I could be of some small help, not being an expert or lawyer but having worked for a company for a decade where we had unusual claims from people with takeout orders saying that they found foreign items in their food or something missing/wrong and looking for free meals or refunds. It was quite difficult to not automatically assume liability without implying they were lying, especially when I knew they were (like when I made something personally).
It's a tricky line that corporations and businesses have to toe as they can't instantly assume liability without factual proof but they also can't accuse people of lying about such incidents.
True that. But like what are the chances someone’s recording before opening the can? Idk it’s just crazy to me.
Nonetheless, I'm sure Arizona would be happy to hear of your experience and try to make it up to you in a proportionate manner, by at least replacing the can you paid for with a coupon or something of that nature and maybe even a more generous gesture if you approach them right. I always did so for the guests that were calm and reasonable about such complaints and saw the really over the top, angry and threatening ones as a red flag, FYI.
