NJ allows a termination of tenancy for the owner to move in, whereas otherwise one wouldn't be allowed. NJ has rent control and doesn't allow to simply not renew in many situations, "good cause" . In this way, a "month to month" in NJ really isn't, at least not for landlords (it is for tenants). /u/matt315 should read that link.
ssdi is social security disability, correct? I thought that was completely untouchable as far as garnishing or any kind of collections? You might want to look into that.
This landlord also refused to use my parents security deposit to cover rent, didn’t factor in the interest that accrued on the security deposit and inflated the amount of rent my parents owed by almost $10K. All of that got shut down in court and the judge had my parents back. He ordered them to pay what they owed (the real amount, not the landlord’s BS claim) and that was it.
Edit: Disregard everything below. I just saw one of your other comments that a judge ordered them out of the house. They must have received notice far earlier than October 8th. Was October 8th the day of the judgement?
