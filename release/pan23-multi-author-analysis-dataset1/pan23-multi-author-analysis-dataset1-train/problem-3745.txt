Pence probably should not have had this document in his possession but I’d also wager it’s not nuclear secrets or information that would compromise important sources, same cannot be said for the Trump docs. It also probably was not taken deliberately for nefarious purposes, and is probably not a document he had no business having in the first place. Pretty sure even as President you can’t just help yourself to whatever classified information you feel like either, high level shit like that is need to know only. So if this is something innocuous like classified schedule or transportation details or security assignments or some such BS, it’s a nothingburger compared to what Trump did. On all fronts.

Exactly. If you consider how many thousands of pages of classified documents are produced in executive and legislative branch offices every single day, this kind of thing is inevitable and mundane. It usually doesn't turn up until somebody doing phd research stumbles upon it decades later.
