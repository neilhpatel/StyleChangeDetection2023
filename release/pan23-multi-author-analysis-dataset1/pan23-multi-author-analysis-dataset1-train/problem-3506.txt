Automation won a long time ago. The same way it took for the internet to roll out to rural areas with fiber, it finally got there. The same is happening to all sorts of sales. Remember when we ordered from catalogues and called the number to place our order? Now we just click a few preferences and it will be on the way shortly? We are rolling towards a lot of automation as soon as AI and engineers can figure them out for you. I’m not a fan of automation, especially when I want to talk to a customer rep in the phone, but there’s no going back and this law is just crating the slow lane of consumers who will switch lanes and avoid the slow-pokes.
Naw. The store I shop at has not only self service lines, but also a scan as you go, and a kiosk to use to checkout. They random customer checks and scan a couple of items to make sure you scanned them. They also do a massive curbside business where employees shop for you.
