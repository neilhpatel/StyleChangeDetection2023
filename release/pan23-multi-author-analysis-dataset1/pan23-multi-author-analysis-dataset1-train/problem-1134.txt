2a) also ask the Bar Association for help in filing a bar complaint against your former lawyer. While you don’t have a right to free counsel in a civil case, lawyers can’t just abandon their clients like this. It’s an ethical violation.
Oh I see. Sorry for the hard time you’re in presently. To piggyback on what others have said a bar complaint is the first thing you should go for. There’s no reason that relief for yourself should suffer due to inadequate representation. From what I understand that is the most critical part.

Contempt carries possible criminal sanctions, including jail. Same rules as above applies - gather everything you can to show you did comply and/or that you didn't know what/how to comply because of ineffective assistance of counsel (ineffective assistance of counsel is generally a criminal term but may be relevant in your jurisdiction). Again, ignorance isn't a defense but it was your lawyers job to inform you what was required and to send it to her and her attorney, so that may take some of the heat off you.
