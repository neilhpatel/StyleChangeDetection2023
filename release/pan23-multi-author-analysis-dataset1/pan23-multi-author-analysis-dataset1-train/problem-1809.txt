This is the truth right here. For all the claims of widespread voter fraud there was never any credible evidence presented. The reality was that there was some isolated incidents of voter fraud around the country - and funny enough most of it was found to have been uncovered by republican led committees and was done by republican voters. They cheated, they know they cheated, and they were convinced that the only reason they lost was because they didn’t cheat enough or that the democrats cheated more. It’s insane. I’m glad a lot of the magas lost their elections - fuck them.

Be funny if in some of the top secret documents Trump held back in his true hidden personal stash covered this and in one fell swoop he goes, "HERE'S THE PROOF I HAD IT ALL ALONG" thus, at the same time, admitting he had more secret stolen documents, admitting DeSantis' win was illegitimate, and admitting he was a corrupt cheater.
