I think it's probably quite a lot easier to argue against your suggestion than to agree with it. Most significant naval powers rise – as did Venice, Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Japan and eventually the US – because their geopolitical positions require them to keep sea lanes open for a variety of reasons. They may be islands, like Britain and Japan, using naval power to forestall invasion and requiring it guarantee their ability to bring in foodstuffs and raw materials. They may be major trading nations, making a large part of their GDP from imports, as was the case with the Venice, Britain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Spain. They may use their navies to pirate and to raid for slaves, as the Barbary states did from the 1500s to the early 1800s. Or states may be imperial powers with a desire to build or protect an empire, as was the case with Portugal, Spain, Britain, the US, Japan in the 1930s and 1940s, and the Netherlands across the period from 1600-1945. As you'll have noted, such drivers are not at all mutually exclusive.
None of these putative correlations should be carried to far: it's of course possible for naval powers to be oppressively governed, poorly developed and fiscally unaccountable, irresponsible or plain incompetent, or indeed for landlocked ones to become thriving democracies - and it's worth noting that Britain saw some reactionary political episodes when maritime mastery was at its height and it only became truly representative as its lead diminished. But the relationship between fleets, state financial sophistication and consent may be an avenue worth exploring.
