This being said, there is some evidence of Christian appropriation of pagan spirituality in certain respects. The Pantheon in Rome, for example, was reconsecrated as a Christian church, a fairly powerful case of adopting a sacred site for new purposes. In terms of saint cults, there is some evidence from different points in the church's history of adopting pagan deities for Christian purposes. In Anglo-Saxon England, Christian chroniclers continued to trace the lineage of rulers through the Germanic god Woden, now re-imagined as an exceptionally skilled and important human. This doesn't get directly to the issue of saints, but it does show that Christians have been willing to adopt pagan tropes and types when they are useful. In more recent history, there is some evidence that the famous Marian apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico may have been a Christian adaptation of an earlier pagan cult practice: prior to the Spanish conquest, there was already a site sacred to the goddess Tonantzin on the hill of Tepeyac, and there are some similarities between the attributes of the Virgin of Guadalupe and other depictions of the Virgin in Spain.
I'd just like to slightly correct one of your points. It is very common for a lot of Protestant congregations to consecrate their churches and to place special emphasis on a consecrated place. They certainly wouldn't consecrate a place to the Immaculate Heart of Mary though.
