Per you post your stepmom has no likely legal claim whatsoever on the proceeds of the life insurance policy of which you are the beneficiary. Chances of any suit are slim but if served be sure and respond so the nice people at the courthouse can be annoyed and/or amused by this also. Unless there is something else you are not posting you owe her nothing. Break contact and enjoy your life without her in it.
If the entity does not accept per stirpes designations for beneficiaries, and the named beneficiary pre-deceases the insured or account owner, then the entity does not have to pay it out to the named beneficiary's estate or heirs. If there are no other named, living beneficiaries, the entity may pay out the assets to the estate of the insured or account owner rather than the heirs if the named (but pre-deceased) beneficiary.
IANAL. Life insurance pays out to the named beneficiary, period. If the named beneficiary had died before the insured life, proceeds would likely occur to the beneficiary’s estate not the insure’s estate. She has been more than well taken care of by inheriting your father’s house and chattels. The fact that your father made a will naming her as beneficiary, but did mot change the beneficiary on his life insurance is evidence that things are going the way he intended.
