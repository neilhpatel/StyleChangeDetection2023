I'm not sure you fully grasp that the trial you have requested isn't to find fault for the collision at all. The trial is to determine your penalty - ticket/fine/endorsement - for cycling across a pedestrian crossing.... which you have always admitted to doing. You mention subpoenas for the driver and police officer as though they are even necessary to attend. They aren't. Because you admit to the crime that led to the ticket. If you want to attempt to sue the driver for damages to you/your bike that's a completely separate action that you would need to undertake and as you've already stated no (honest) lawyer would take that action as you shouldn't have cycled across in front of them. Plus it would most likely lead to a counter suit from the driver for damages to his vehicle - which he would likely win. Having said all that I am sorry you were hurt, hope you make a speedy recovery. If you want to address the prejudice you experienced from the police officer you could make a formal complaint. I hope you had insurance for your bike.
Emotionally, that's infuriating. There are no bike lanes, and if it's illegal to ride on the sidewalk, there's no safe place to ride at all. Legally, however, I see your point perfectly, so thank you for educating me on the law.
