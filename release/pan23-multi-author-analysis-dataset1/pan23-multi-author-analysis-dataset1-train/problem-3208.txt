I believe you never see questions answered because the 'hot' filter pushes threads out of the front page relatively quickly, often before an answer can be made. There's obviously a greater demand than supply to answers to questions here, so more recent interesting questions supplant slightly older also interesting questions before they can get answers.
No, I’m sorry. You don’t get to come in here, complain about our modding based on your ignorance, then pass it off like it ain’t no big deal. That’s not “fair enough.” You don’t understand the workload we have, you’re not familiar with the steps we take to mitigate issues, and you’re entitled beyond belief to boot because the sub isn’t “easily readable and cleanly moderated” to your liking. You should actually apologize for your misunderstanding and retract your inflammatory remarks. Otherwise, you don’t need to kick it around our sub.
Definitely recommend the askhistorians extension. It puts a number next to the number of comments and it shows how many proper undeleted answers there are. So you can see at a glance which questions have been answered.
