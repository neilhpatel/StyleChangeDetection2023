Our water utility has asked all customers to stop dripping faucets. However, our apartment complex has said we need to continue dripping faucets. (I’m inclined to follow my apartment management’s directive, since I could theoretically be sued for causing damage to pipes.).
>If after a casualty loss the rental premises are as a practical matter totally unusable for residential purposes and if the casualty loss is not caused by the negligence or fault of the tenant, a member of the tenant’s family, or a guest or invitee of the tenant, either the landlord or the tenant may terminate the lease by giving written notice to the other any time before repairs are completed. If the lease is terminated, the tenant is entitled only to a pro rata refund of rent from the date the tenant moves out and to a refund of any security deposit otherwise required by law.
Ok. More details without naming names... I was hired by a company (ABC). The company then connected me with a company (XYZ). I had interviews with both. I work for XYZ. I bill ABC. ABC in turn bills XYZ. ABC pays me.
> (c)If after a casualty loss the rental premises are partially unusable for residential purposes and if the casualty loss is not caused by the negligence or fault of the tenant, a member of the tenant’s family, or a guest or invitee of the tenant, the tenant is entitled to reduction in the rent in an amount proportionate to the extent the premises are unusable because of the casualty, but only on judgment of a county or district court. A landlord and tenant may agree otherwise in a written lease.
