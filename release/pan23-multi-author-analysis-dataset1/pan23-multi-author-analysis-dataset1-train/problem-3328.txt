In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Step 3. When the lawsuit is inevitably thrown out of court, Trump pockets the money his supporters "donated". When he is forced to pay reparations, like in this most recent case with Hillary Clinton, odds are his supporters probably donated far more money than what he is being forced to pay. So Trump simply pays the reparations from donated money and still makes a profit.

To be honest any lawyer that takes in any work for Trump and or his organisation and doesn't charge time and a half and get funds on account all the way through, together with a retainer that allows them to put a lein on his assets for any liability incurred by them in the course of carrying out his instructions has almost a little intelligence as Trump has.

In one of trump's NY cases she submitted an affidavit asserting that after a thorough search by her there were no financial records to be found at any trump residence (including MAL) or business. This thorough search was carried out a week before the Saudis arrived at Bedminster. If she did a thorough search, that means she saw all of the classified documents at MAL.
