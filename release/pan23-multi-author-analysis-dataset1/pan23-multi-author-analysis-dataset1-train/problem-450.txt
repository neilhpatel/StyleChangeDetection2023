1) How the company examines your DNA. Your DNA is about 3 billion base pairs long. Obviously, it's uneconomical to fully sequence each person's full genetic background. What these ancestry genetic companies do instead is they take many short sections of your DNA, and look for mutations that are commonly associated with ethnic groups. These mutations are called SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms. 23andme looks at about 900,000 SNPs. That's a lot of SNPs, but a good proportion of them don't give any meaningful data yet. 23andme is simply collecting the data from those SNPs to examine them for new trait associations in the future. For example, genetic traits associated with being a morning person:
Genetic variation between humans is a very interesting topic. You use the example of Eurasian people vs Africans as an example of two populations which are "easily distinguishable". On the surface, the phenotypes (looks) between Eurasians and Africans are seemingly obvious. For this reason, one might assume that there is a lot of genetic diversity between Eurasians and Africans. However, the genetic variation between Africans to other Africans is greater than the genetic variation between Africans and Eurasians! This means that if an African from Zimbabwe compared their DNA to an African from Nambia, there would be more differences between their DNA, than if they compared their DNA to a white person in Scotland. This isn't necessarily relevant to your question, but just something that I wanted to point out highlighting the fun genetic variation between people and, again the problems that occur when people try to genetically define "races" and "ethnicities" and trace back our ancestry by DNA.
Thanks for this answer. I think I understand what you're saying about the sample population to build the database being the source of certain errors and biases. What about accuracy between what you would think are easily distinguishable groups, like European or African?
