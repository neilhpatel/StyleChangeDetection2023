Idk it’s kind of a good thing imo. That goes for removing things from our constitution too - which includes abortion. This favors Dems as they are typically the ones who don’t show up, so you can’t have a sneaky one time referendum to remove abortion during a midterm while democrats typically don’t show, it would have to pass twice to officially remove it from our state constitution.
Australia?? Do they have dark money organizations like Koch Industries and Heartland Institute that are funded by the fossil fuel industry? Terrible comparison!
But it is a method that works. Weed legalization has gained broad support because it's been implemented in a few states, and grew out from there. Vote by mail, for as much as some Republican politicians shit all over it during the pandemic, was a proven method that was expanded, and some of those expansions have remained in place. Ranked choice is going through the same thing. Show people it's possible, and you can use it as a real life example to point to.
