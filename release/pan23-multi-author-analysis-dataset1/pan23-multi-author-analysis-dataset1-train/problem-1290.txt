It's not as if they can unilaterally cut SS or medicare anyways. Both of them are independent laws separate from normal budget appropriations. It would take both the house and the senate passing a bill in order to make any changes. No way the senate allows the house to dictate that. The senate historically has been the "grown up" chamber, and it seems as though that has never been more true than it is now. The senate will spend the next two years holding the house in line.
