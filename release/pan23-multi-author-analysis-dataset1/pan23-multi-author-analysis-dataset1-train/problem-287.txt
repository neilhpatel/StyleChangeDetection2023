I want to read about politics in Medieval Italy, Germany, France, and the Norse countries. How did a Kingdom's government actually work? Who were its members, and what were their positions? What are the practical differences between a Duke and a Count? What was actually discussed when court was held. Stuff like that. Any book recommendations?
Cool! So, the first layer of a man's clothing of that time was the white linen shirt - as fine a linen as the wearer could afford. It would be high-necked, full-sleeved, and extend to at least mid-thigh.
But to my comment on being one sided: General Grant had written a report two weeks before Garfield proposed his legislation and within this report Grant had quoted Generals Sherman and Sheridan as speaking to the "necessity" of removing the corrupt bureaus in favor of military regulation, and in his speech Garfield makes the case upon the ability of oversight through court-martial, whereas the bureaus were corruptible and without what he saw as proper oversight (Mr Windom was the Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, hence his opposition). The quote on making treaties ("...for the representatives of the great Government of the United States to sit down in a wigwam and make treaties with a lot of painted and half naked savages.") cuts the next line off.
