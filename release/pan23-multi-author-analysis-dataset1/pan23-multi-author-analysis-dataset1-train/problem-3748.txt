2,705 In New Orleans, Delphine LaLaurie was arrested &amp; tried at least once for mistreatment of slaves &amp; her house was burned down by an angry mob in 1834. What made her level of brutality so scandalous &amp; what separated it, legally and socially, from the "acceptable" brutality of day-to-day slave life?
I don't know. Call your representatives? Complain to the National Archives? I don't know what kind of teeth they have to enforce various Records Acts, but they could at least not officially say "Whatever, do what you want.".
I zeroed in on one particular moment earlier this week: , the first piece to publicly confront Lovecraft on his prejudices, in this case regarding some criticism regarding the recently-released film The Birth of a Nation, which later that same year would serve as inspiration for the second incarnation of the Ku Klux Klan. The language Lovecraft uses is not always pleasant - fair warning for anyone that wants to clickthrough - but it is key to see both what Lovecraft believed and what it was like for him to get challenged on those beliefs.
