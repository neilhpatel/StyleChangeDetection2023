That is a great question, and I’m sure that aside from the crocs, the box jelly, stonefish, blue-ringed octopus, sharks, cone snails, funnel-web spiders, cassowaries, one of the 50+ species of venomous snakes, or any number of animals that for one reason or another could be a threat (did the platypus really need venom too?) could answer. And if you spend all your time outdoors looking for an answer, the sun will reward you with a heavy dose of UV radiation.
