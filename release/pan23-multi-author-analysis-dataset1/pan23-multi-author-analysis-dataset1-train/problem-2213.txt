As long as you have the support of 145 (435/3) other members of the House, regardless of party membership, it is impossible to remove you from office.
It's the US House of Representatives itself, and by their rules they can't collectively get rid of a fellow representative unless 2/3 of the representatives vote to expel him. Good luck with that. Out of all the awful representatives over all the years of the United States, \-- and those were for treason or bribery.

Everything is ultimately the responsibility of the voters. They could vote in some kind of recall measure, but these are the same people who voted for the members of the party that still supports this guy and refuse to kick him out, so why would they do that? The voters are either clueless or donâ€™t care. They got what they voted for, a bunch of lying assholes.
Independent journalism remains the best mechanism. Government investigating government isn't going to be as reliable.
