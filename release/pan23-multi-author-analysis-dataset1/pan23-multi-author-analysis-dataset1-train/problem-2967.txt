The Ukrainian military was too much for the Russians, so they are going to team up with the Chinese to pick on little Taiwan,, I hope that the Ukrainians take the war all the way to Moscow, annex European Russia and leave Russia with only Siberia,, that way the new Russians will return to caves and foraging like they were hundreds of years ago.
Yes. But it doesn't help to say the easily disputed "Russian missile" as it just feeds the propagandist "see they lie about this what about these other things". Which is a common frame. Best to just be accurate.
South Koreans never even considered war a massive threat since North Korea always tries to intimidate the South, but they never do anything that would start an all-out conflict (and probably never will) and also people got used to threats of war thats why South Koreans behave quite alarmingly on outsiders pov.
The fault lies with Russian. But accuracy requires that it be the Ukrainian air defense missile. That changes nothing about who is responsible. Whether a Russian missile inadvertently entered polish land or Ukrainian air defense missile landed in Polish land because of malfunction after firing at incoming Russian missiles it's neither here nor there it's the same responsible party.
