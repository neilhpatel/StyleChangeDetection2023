And what should a tenant do when the landlord orally claims to have sufficient legal cause to kick out the tenant despite the ban on no fault evictions?
I would suggest that the proper approach would be for the tenant to tell the landlord "There's a a ban on no fault evictions. If you nonetheless claim to have legal cause to evict me like a letter from the city, I'd like to city a copy of it and confirm it with the city on my own. Once I do that, I'll move out in __ days as required by law. If you won't provide me with such documentation, I will assume it doesn't exist, and I'm not leaving.".
Depending on where they are located there are different notice requirements for month to month tenants, some with increased notice requirements for long term MTM tenants, or in some it can be just a 30 day notice to vacate. If it is the latter, then they will need to start looking for a place to live immediately and be out within the 30 day period or face an eviction filing once it is over.
The landlord would also need to give them at least 60 days notice, not 30 because they have been living there for more then 12 months.
