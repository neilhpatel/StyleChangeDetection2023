In a renting situation, would it not be a contract modification and thus open the door to consider this a constructive eviction? The dog was fine on day one.
Every lease I've had for places with a HOA or Condo Association has a clause requiring the tenant to abide by the associations rules and regulations, as well as allowing the landlord to hold the tenant responsible for violating them.
they don’t need any grounds. They are a condo association and can literally make almost any rule they want. They could even ban all dogs if they were so inclined. That said, they can’t compel you personally to do jack shit. They can, however, and will, most likely, fine your landlord thousands of dollars for having non-compliant tenant. You should go and read your lease agreement with the landlord. It most likely states that you must follow all condo rules and failure to do so is grounds for lease termination. If your landlord begins getting fined, he will want you out like yesterday. Shit’s about to get real for you… Your only hope to avoid major drama is that you are somehow grandfathered based on you being there from before the change but honestly that’s not likely.
