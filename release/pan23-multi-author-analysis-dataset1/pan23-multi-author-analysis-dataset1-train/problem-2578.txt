Their air defence equipment is good, it's one of their few export articles that are consistently winning sales based on performance alone, and not just because it's cheaper.
Also... I have stressed this quite a few times, our soldiers are actively combat trained which counts for a fucking lot vs a country which just does drills. That is a big thing in warfare because no matter how fanatical you are, once the bullets start flying and arty starts falling, shit changes big mentally. "Oh, fuck the US. They are weak and will lose. I'm not afraid." Bull shit.
Unironically: the biggest saving grace for the West will probably prove to be Obama's pivot to Asia, the US decision to engage in declassification of content to allies (one of the decisions which led to the pre-war warning to Ukraine), and the USMC / Army preparing so rigorously for island hopping warfare by working to innovate their tactics and platforms before they have to do so in the heat of a hellish war in the Pacific.
I don't get it. China says hypocrite stupid thing A, India says hypocrite stupid thing B... This is USELESS.
