I totally agree with your second paragraph but then at the same time you seem to be aware of your behaviors and how it affect others. Can you elaborate more on what is that you are doing that is making "a bunch of women" think you are stalking them?
Why would "a bunch of women" label you as a stalker? You say that "your behavior" shouldn't be considered stalking because you looked it up. What is it that you are doing?
So I did try to contact police about it and they said they couldn’t do it because the death threats where made over the internet through Messenger (and after looking at the statue for harassment that is actually not true) but I wanted the police to mitigate the situation because when I did go to the police it was because one of the girl’s boyfriends was trying to lure me to jump me. I had explained to the officer that outside school walls I was often armed with a pocket knife for personal protection and that I didn’t want to hurt the kid. The officer said that him interfering could escalate the situation so I never brought up the harassment after that.
