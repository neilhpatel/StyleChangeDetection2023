Architecture and construction practices are regional and cultural. What works gets repeated and over time it becomes so common that people forget why things are done a certain way. This is known as vernacular architecture.
Interesting. That is actually a bit earlier than I expected, which leads me to another question, although this might be outside your focus, so perhaps someone else would need to weigh in, but in any case, how did the post-war boom specifically impact the approach to home construction? I'm thinking about the massive expansion and growth of the suburbs, and stuff like Levittown and its progeny. Was this expansion building off already existing methods of cheap construction that was already developed, or were they pioneering new methods that further brought down costs (beyond, of course, the simple mass-construction angle)?
1. The largest, by volume, thing that most people buy is a car. Think of how much it costs and how large it is. Now consider how many times larger a house is. If you paid the same price per pound, as Buckminster Fuller suggested and tried after WWII using idled airplane manufacturing facilities, or volume, even basic homes would cost many times what they currently cost. We need to use inexpensive materials because we need so much of them. Europe gets around this by having a large supply of existing high quality buildings (), living in smaller spaces, having lower rates of home ownership, and accepting higher construction prices and longer payback periods for commercial buildings (at least in Germany which I'm more familiar with).
