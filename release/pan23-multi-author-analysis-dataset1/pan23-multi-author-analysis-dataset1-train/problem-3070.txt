Absurd. Dems won every close race in Nevada except the governorship, which was pretty much bound to fail due to Sisalak's bumbling. The thing about the Democratic Party is that it allows for a variety of viewpoints. That's what it means to be liberal. The fact that moderate and more left-leaning Democrats are engaging in a healthy debate is a good thing.

The governorship was doomed, unfortunately. Of all the states affected by COVID, Nevada was the hardest to govern. And Sisolak came up short. He had a tough task, but he came up short in terms of leadership and policy. He shouldn't have run for another term.
The only reason these people have power is a small group of activists who are chronically online and extremely politically engaged in an ideological struggle to push our politics in their utopian socialist direction.
The general election eventually arrives, and itâ€™s clear that the average voter does not want a socialist political revolution despite what a small chronically online minority of the party wants you to believe.
