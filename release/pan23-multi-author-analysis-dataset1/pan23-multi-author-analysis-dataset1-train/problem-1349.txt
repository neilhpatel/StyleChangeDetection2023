Like, there are thousands of man-made gods and the christians just chose to believe in exactly ONE of them. If they ever stepped away and applies the same logic that makes them disbelieve in the other god to their own god, they would quickly understand us atheists.
The more kids know about religions and faiths, the more they are gonna see what an artificial concept they are and the more they are gonna stay atheists. And the sooner we (the mankind) drop the concept of religion, the better.
Only Christianity. My Ontario public school had a lady come by with a felt board depicting the "Real Story of Easter". This was 16 years ago. My schools all decorated for Christmas, and ran "Operation Christmas Child". We would also have Christmas concerts.
Presenting information about religions (both local and global), including demonstrations of their rituals? Yes.
If we are going to continue to celebrate those traditions in schools and allow students to opt out of them, then I have no objection to exposing students to traditions from First Nations and other backgrounds on the same basis.
