Všechny smrtelné hříchy, zvláště veřejné, a jiné neřesti protivné zákonu božímu buďtež v každém stavu řádně zakazovány, stíhány, trestány – That all mortal sins, particularly those public, and other vices in opposition to the Law of God should be in every situation duly banned, prosecuted, and punished.
Ferdinand II. was elected by The Bohemian Diet to be the next Czech King in 1617 on condition that he would honour The Letter. Which, he did not intend to. Soon after the election, he took matters firmly in his hands despite Matthias, old and ill, still formally being the king of Bohemia until his death in 1619. This was one of major factors of why did the 30-Year War start in 1618 and not later.
With this open hand, the Emperor introduced the Counter-Reformation into Bohemia, which began a variety of reCatholicisation programmes (including one which taught the Catholic Faith to Bohemian peasantry through music, the effects of which led to the Bohemians being nicknamed the "Musical People", and would even later lead Mozart to comment that he much preferred Prague to Vienna, as the people there appreciated his music better). The Counter-Reformation was broadly successful, to the point that Hussitism became a dead movement in Bohemia, surviving only in small pockets in Moravia and expatriate communities in places like the Netherlands and Saxony.
TL;DR: Hussitism remained a prominent ideology within Bohemia until well after the Reformation was established and was only truly extinguished at the same time as religious borders in Europe began to resolidify under the Counter-Reformation and the post-Thirty Years War period.
1627: Ferdinand II. issues a mandate that orders non-catholic nobles to either convert to catholicism within 6 months or to go into exile.
