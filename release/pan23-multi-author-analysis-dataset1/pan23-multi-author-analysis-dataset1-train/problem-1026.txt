The general consensus is that the Notitia depicts a "base pattern" which could be added to. We've been able to confirm that the Notitia patterns are accurate (see the very recent research of Marko Jelusic) by successfully matching patterns to previously difficult to interpret depictions in damaged murals or epigraphy.
Quite simply, we don't know. Scholars have long postulated that Constantine III would have taken the comitatenses (field army) of the comes brittaniarum (Esmonde-Cleary's The Ending of Roman Britain includes a widely-known example of this). The problem is, the Notitia Dignitatum doesn't give us any idea as to how large this force was. As for Britain's limitanei (less well-equipped garrison troops), current scholarship is moving towards the idea that most of them remained in Britain, having become embedded into local communities (see Rob Collins, Hadrian's Wall and the End of Empire). How Roman or British Constantine III's army was in character is, again, unclear. Stuart Laycock has argued that the large number of British military belt buckles found at Richborough indicates a large number of native irregulars embarking for Gaul. Though we can't necessarily associate this with Constantine III.
