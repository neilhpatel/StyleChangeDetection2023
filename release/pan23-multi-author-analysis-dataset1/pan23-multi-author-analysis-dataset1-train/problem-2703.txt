The most common type of carronade -- the kind you'll see if you visit HMS Victory -- fired a 68-pound ball. The largest long guns on the Victory were bored to take a 32-pound ball, and themselves weighed 56 long hundredweight, or in modern terms, something just north of 6200 pounds. (There's a reason the long guns on Victory were replaced by fiberglass -- they were slowly breaking its back.).
A larger shot at a slower velocity will be more effective at punching holes into the enemy's waterline, provided you have the accuracy and timing to place your shot below or at the waterline during the right moment in you and your enemies roll. The name of the game in wooden ship combat is energy transfer. The more energy that can be expended by the shot before passing through the hull, the larger the hole and splinters. A smaller and faster shot will carry more kinetic energy through the impacts and will not cause the same damage. A good example of this is defensive or hunting ammunition for modern rifles. A bullet going fast will not be effective if it doesn't expand and dump as much energy as possible into the target before it passes through or stops. Another thing to consider is that not every ship is built to the same standard and the lower hull may be strong enough to resist a low velocity shot, but can be pierced by a smaller and faster shot.
