That’s why we have monopoly busting. Eventually you get to where we are now: Huge monopolies that have crushed competition and now languish, not just because they fully control the market but also because they got to where they are not on their own merits but by buying up and exploiting others. That’s all they’re good at, but now there’s no one left to steal from. It’s not just bad for consumers and the economy. It’s fucking pathetic. Our “titans of industry” are a bunch of pampered robber barons.
Exactly. I've seen some people toss out some numbers on eggs. Labor costs up 20-30%. Feed up 50%. egg cartons are up too but no numbers. Etc etc. Point is, egg prices are up 250% or more. This does not compute. Except... I figure egg prices are just inelastic. Cause even though the price goes up, people are clearly still buying them. It's a broken market. No amount of "paying more for eggs" will get more eggs in the market. It just makes it harder on folks who need good protein for breakfast and don't have time to do sausage or bacon.
