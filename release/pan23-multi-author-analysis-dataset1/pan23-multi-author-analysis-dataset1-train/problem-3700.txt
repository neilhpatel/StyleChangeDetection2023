Totally valid concern. By the same token, relying on Turkey to actually adhere to its commitment to NATO in a war is also questionable. The idea over overlaying a separate defense agreement is just speculation--NATO itself establishes restrictions on most members from doing that--otherwise one member could drag the rest of NATO into a conflict that originally involved a nonmember state.
Right. People are failing to understand this. Turkey is FAR more valuable than Finland and Sweden combined.
Consider the opposite situation. Imagine that Sweden has joined without the express consent of Hungary and Turkey. Imagine they are attacked, and try invoking article 5.
Realistically, NATO doesn’t need Turkey. Aside from maybe the US, NATO doesn’t really need any specific country tbh. Turkey occupies a strategic location, but it’s not as if turkey no longer accepting NATO troops/aircraft on its soil would leave NATO with zero other alternatives. The US has bases in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, etc.
Turkey is an extremely unreliable ally with an extremely important geographic location. For the time being, that means it holds the winning hand. C'est la vie.
