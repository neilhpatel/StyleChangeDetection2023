The claim made in the latter literature is, broadly, that slavery was crucial not only for building up the American economy, but also the broader rise of global capitalism led by European industrialization. This interpretation is roundly rejected by most economic historians. Slavery was, in the estimation of most of the economic historians of American slavery (Gavin Wright, Alan Olmstead and Paul Rhode, to name the most prominent) a tremendously profitable institution for those who owned slaves; "capitalist" in the sense of managed, operated for profit, and innovative; and a major engine of the southern agricultural economy. But in the long run, slavery was an impediment to industrialisation that kept resources locked in relatively unproductive sectors with few long-term prospects, and prevented the broad spread of free labour and education that underpinned late 19th c. economic development. It was Northeastern industry rather than Southern cash crop agriculture that "built" America in terms of its "meteoric climb.".
There is an older debate, rooted in questions about the origin of capitalism, where some scholars argued the basic forms of capitalism: paying people a wage for their labor, divisions of labor, technological innovation in pursuit of maximizing profit, and so forth, developed out of Early Modern agriculture in Great Britain, then spread. I think you can take that account, which I basically agree with, and hold it in your head at the same time as you acknowledge the centrality of slavery.
