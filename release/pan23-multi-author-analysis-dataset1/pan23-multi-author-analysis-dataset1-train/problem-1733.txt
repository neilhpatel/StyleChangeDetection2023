This is how fascist Republicans attack democracy from within our own government: They cause as much suffering and chaos as they can - then blame democracy for the suffering and chaos they cause. The mass media supports these attacks with headlines questioning the legitimacy of public education, human rights, equality, safe elections and justice. Media outlets normalize violent fascism, they use false equivalency and self-victimization to attack the pillars of democracy. The call to action for all good people is to promote the pillars of democracy and democracy itself in your own home - and defend it passionately in your community.
Okay…. I snapped at you because your comment was completely irrelevant to what I said. You implied that I was saying all republicans want small government and that’s not at all what I said. I also became defensive because the nature of this sub. This sub is completely one sided and I usually avoid it because it is completely overran with bots. To be honest, I thought you was a bot.

Done. No one worries and if the Dems acted life these Constitution breakers were as disgusting as they are, and gets them in court in front of a judge, we could get back to a 2-party system.
