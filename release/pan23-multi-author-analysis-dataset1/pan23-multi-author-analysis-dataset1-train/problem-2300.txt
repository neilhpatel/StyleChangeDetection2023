I also responded to OP in another thread, so I hope this isn't considered spam; my thoughts on this: First of all, I appreciate you sourcing this in such a detailed manner. It's nice to see some facts on this. That said, my two cents is Pete's tossing out bandaids to gunshot victims, after arriving late to the ER. It's something, but also still not a great look overall. Increasing fines tenfold is still way less than profits for being as dangerous as possible. Won't do shit. If he's advocating changing fines, it should at least be changed to a percentage of profit, or total revenue; though what really needs to happen is nationalizing the railroads; but Pete's way too conventional to ever consider any of these things. Which is why a lot of us on the left can't stand the guy.
He DOES have the authority to immediately increase the shipper and carrier fees to do his last bullet point, provide more funding for training emergency response to hazmat incidents in commercial transportation like this one. That is where the funds currently come from, those fees. He can increase them RIGHT NOW, but instead put the onus on congress to fund an activity that doesnâ€™t even operate on congressional funding to begin with.
