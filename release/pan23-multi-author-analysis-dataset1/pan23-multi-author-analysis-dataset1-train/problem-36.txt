So what you had happening is that Alcuin (and people influenced by him) were trying to drag Latin back to classical Latin (of course what Alcuin thought was proper Latin and how actual classical Romans spoke were not always the exact same thing, but he was trying) but random people in the countryside weren't about to change their whole way of talking just because Alcuin said so their spoken language kept on diverging from Latin into the various Romance languages. The result of this is that you started getting more and more of a split between Church Latin and the language everyday people spoke.
This didn't last forever though, eventually the gap between the Latin priests were writing and what people were saying became harder to bridge. The big name here is Alcuin of York, specifically what he did in the court of Charlemagne. Alcuin obviously came from York and was thus not a native speaker of a Romance language but rather learned it out of books so he pronounced things closer to how they were spelled because that's what he knew. This wasn't just him but the Northumbrian (loosely modern northern England) scholarly community in general and back from there to the Irish monks (who also, obviously, were not native speakers of Romance languages either) who had an enormous influence on the early church history of Northumbria.
Thanks for a very interesting response! It’s not hard to understand how dialects varied across the countries. But it’s hard to imagine what it would be like living there, given the standardized languages we have now.
