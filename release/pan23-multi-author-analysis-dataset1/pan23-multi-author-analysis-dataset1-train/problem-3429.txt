Both authors also note the an audience of educated literati that grows extensively with the reintroduction of the imperial examinations in the Ming era. Lorge argues that the shift from theatrical perfomance to written text is crucial, and that one should read especially the written literary works on martial arts as catering to literati interests. At the same time, Lorge notes that there was a tension between these literari and the martial arts culture, that literati attitudes retained a holdover of the civil-military split that had developed in the Song dynasty, now tempered by the practical need for martial arts as violence and a burgeoning martial arts culture as entertainment.
To give a little bit of context, in Politics and Identity in Chinese Martial Arts, Lu Zhouxiang correlates the flourishing of martial romances in the Ming and Qing dynasties with intentional government policies to create a martial arts culture as part of a wider environment of military reform and national identity in the Ming dynasty. It should be noted that Water Margin and ROTK would be at the beginning of this period, and would probably be more accurate to say they shaped the martial arts culture that would follow, and themselves probably emerge from martial arts taking shape as recreation and entertainment in the Song and Yuan dynasties in the performance arts; Peter Lorge notes this in Chinese Martial Arts: From Antiquity to the Twenty-First Century.
