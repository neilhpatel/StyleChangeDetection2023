3. While the odds don't favour spontaneous uprising, the advantage is that it can quickly spiral out of control and the pressure is really on the police state to extinguish it as rapidly as possible. That's why the first moments of the uprising are critical. There needs to be a rapid succession of victories - attacks on police stations, mobbing a police group, stuff like that. If people smell any sort of weakness on the police state, it doesn't take many to join in before the level of risk that one has to take on to act gets low enough to make it seem feasible. That's why it's possible that there are people who are ready to take these initial steps, who are ready to risk even death for this, who have not yet done so because right now it there isn't the critical mass to follow up with. If you have the ability and readiness to sacrifice yourself for such a cause, the last thing you want is for it to be quietly put down and lead to nothing. That leads to my last point:
Russia, in particular, has a huge interest in maintaining the appearance of a democracy with international prestige, the loss of that erodes putins credibility at home and makes coups against him more likely.
