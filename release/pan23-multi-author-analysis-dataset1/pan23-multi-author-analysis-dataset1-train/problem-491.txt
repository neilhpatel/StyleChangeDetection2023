The thing is, this sub is a very specific community with a very specific goal. High quality, in-depth answers on history. It's askhistorians, not askrandompeoplewhattheythink. Check out the . There's hundreds of answers, and they give you an idea what kind of posts we look for. The important thing, especially for this meta discussion, is that high quality answers like that take time. Often several hours. So as part of that we remove all the low quality crap that tends to accumulate. Jokes, one liners, wikipedia links, etc. We don't want that.
and once all that's done, the upvotes come in from the hundreds of people reading the thread who aren't experts in anything relating to the question, and then when a moderator comes along eventually, they have to sift through a million comments to find the relevant one to flair, AND the flired comment won't even be seen because the-looks-good-but-is-actually-terrible-and-riddled-with-speculation answer is upvoted above it.
Of course not. Very little has changed in the past few years as to what we remove. The only thing that has changed is the size of the subreddit, which means that the volume of bad comments, which we always have removed, grows in number. In the current top thread, which I presume is what is frustrating you, , which as you can see is a mixture of people complaining about removed comments, and masturbation "jokes" (all usernames are of course edited out).
