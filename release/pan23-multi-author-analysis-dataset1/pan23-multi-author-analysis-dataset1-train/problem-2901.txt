I personally don't think there was a Celtic invasion resulting in a continuation of the continental Celtic traditions - I don't think the archaeological evidence holds up, as you've mentioned - but it is still the most commonly held theory. The Celtic from the West theory is growing (namely, the idea that the insular Celts were a distinct people covering the Atlantic archipelago as well as the west coast of Spain, France [Brittany] etc.) but it still hasn't really taken hold. Likely part of the resistance to this theory is, of course, change is a hard pill to swallow, but it also doesn't help that the purported "strongest" evidence is that of Tartessian being a Celtic language. Outside of those pushing the theory, this idea has been widely discredited (to the point where, as far as I'm aware, no one's bothered to even publish a rebuttal because it's considered so incredibly preposterous) and unfortunately the whole theory has kind of been "sunk" by that single facet of it.
I'm on the fence about celtic from the west. I found Cunliffe very convincing but I'm an archaeologist and all the Celtic studies people I know reckon his grasp of the linguistics isnt the best.
Absolutely. I don't think there's any sense in it at all. Even if we believe that the written records preserves an earlier, oral tradition, we still have presumably a few centuries and a significant geographic distance. As I said, I don't think this is a retained cultural practice distinctive to Celts, I lean more towards these things being either widespread things that occurred in multiple places (in order to acknowledge its existence in different historical and geographic sources.).
