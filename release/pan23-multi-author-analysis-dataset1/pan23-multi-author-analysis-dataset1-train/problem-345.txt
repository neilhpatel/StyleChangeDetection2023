Not to nitpick, but part of the reason that Japan prior to Perry is frequently referred to in English as "closed" is that it's basically how the Japanese themselves termed it for a long time. 鎖国 [sakoku] was the term developed in the early 1800s for the Tokugawa shogunate policy of national isolation and literally means something along the lines of "locked country"; the corresponding term 開国 [kaikoku] means "opened country" or "unsealed country." Obviously the Japanese themselves understood how their own policy operated but still chose to speak figuratively about it. I do believe, however, that 海禁 [kaikin] ("maritime ban") has also gained acceptance in modern times as a more fitting term, and sakoku may be used more in ways that explicitly indicate it's not intended literally, such as referring to it as "so-called sakoku" (いわゆる鎖国).

You’re right that I didn’t do a good job of making my point. I should have written more clearly that the timing issue I was talking about was that of kaikin predating sakoku. In trying to give more context about why that mattered, I did repeat too much of what you said. My bad.
