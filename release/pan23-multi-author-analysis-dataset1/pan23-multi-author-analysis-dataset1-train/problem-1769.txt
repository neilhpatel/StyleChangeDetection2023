Three; if you agree with their fears, you can try to negotiate terms and location as trying to be a good neighbor. You can say if they want to put it on the property line you will help pay; but since they wish to do it asap; you will have to agree on a payment plan to pay your portion. And agree to having the bill being wrote out and shared to you disclosing what the workers charged. If that is not ok, then say sorry, but then if they wish to have draining then they can pay and put on their property instead. That you're not responsible for their failure to get the place inspected. And everything on your side is currently safe, solid, and without current possible risks to doing any damage to their property. It was there when they looked at the house, and bought it so they was fully aware of them before their purchase.

100% to asking the county/city building department about liability or alternatives. Someone who knows the local building code can be a great asset in communicating with your neighbour and CYA.
