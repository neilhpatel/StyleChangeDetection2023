1) Culturally, they weren't as interested in warfare as the tribes in the Great Plains or on the Eastern Seaboard. Because California has a tremendous amount of natural resources, there wasn't as much conflict over them; and because the resources were tied to water and seasons aren't generally as harsh in California, tribal migration (and potential conflict arising from unexpected contact) was focused on moving up and down mountains rather than, say, across the continent.
This is exactly the kind of information I was needing! Very interesting and it all makes so much sense.
2) Because of the wealth of natural resources, Californian tribes remained hunter-gatherers long past the time other Native Americans became pastoral or agriculturally centric.
Thanks so much for your contribution! Are there any books you could recommend for me to learn more about the West Coast tribes?
California is surrounded by some very inhospitable territory. Walking through eastern Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, or northern Mexico is no joke. There are deserts and mountains, and a lot of them; and the weather somehow seems to be either freezing cold or boiling hot. So there's probably no _major_ migratory pressure from the east or the south. The tribes from the north were doing pretty well for themselves as it was, so I'm not sure that there was a major impetus for them to move, either.
