If he does the neutering on his own in his name the dog is his. At least that was the case for me in Alabama. Her vet records were in my name at that point so they could do nothing.
Follow that up immediately with a written message (email or text or however you're communicating) that says "Dear name of shelter, due to your facility not following through with its contractual obligation to provide neutering services for the dog I adopted from your facility on (date), I will be to finding separate neutering services not affiliated with name of shelter. To off set the cost of having to find separate neutering services the cost of neutering services have been deducted from the adoption fees which I sent on (date of 2nd PayPal) if name of shelter does not agree to this amendment to the contract then name of shelter can refund the fees and retrieve the dog in question, at name of shelter's expense, after the refund has been successfully processed. If I don't receive a response to this message in 3 business days name of shelters agreement to amendment will be assumed.
I would then wait 3 days for a response/refund before scheduling your dog to be neutered at a shelter or vet of your choice. If the shelter tries to get the dog back after your dog has been neutered demand the cost of the service and refund of fees before you will return the dog.
Go ahead and PayPal the shelter the adoption fees minus the neutering service, if you are unsure of the cost called a few vets and shelters in your area and subtract the mean cost.
2. You didn’t mention the dog’s age or breed but it is common practice to wait until a dog is a year old before having the procedure.
