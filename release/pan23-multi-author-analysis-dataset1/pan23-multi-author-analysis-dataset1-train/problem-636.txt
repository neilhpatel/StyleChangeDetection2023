In other words, he knows full well it wasn't a loan. Loans have definite repayment terms. Even the sloppiest interpersonal loan consists, at least, of a promise to pay back the principal eventually.
2. That is family - that is different. When I help, or get help from, family, I usually do/expect something as a "thank you" gesture for taking the time and effort to help me/help them - the harder the situation, the nicer the "thank you" gift. Normally, a little gas money or meals during the time help is being given are enough. The man demanding the money is neither the OP's family, or his FIL, although he IS the cheating former fiancee's father. Also, the timing of this comes into question - if this was asked back when she left the OP, it might have been different (not for me), but he only asks for it when he finds out the house is going to be sold TWO YEARS LATER? No, that's predatory, and sounds like he's trying to weasel money out of the OP. If it were me, I'd be incensed and tell him to GTFA, then block him from my cell phone, along with all social media & email accounts. His daughter broke up the future I had planned with her? He can get wrecked!
