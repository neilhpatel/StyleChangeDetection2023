Last but not least they are getting real war experience in an extremely tough situation that most NATO countries have never seen since ww2 (and for many of those we need to go even further back in time to see a real full scale war fought by the country itself) with maybe the exceptions of US in Korea and Vietnam. But that's 50 years ago with very different technologies.
Because we probably could have negotiated recognition of those territories in exchange for extremely favorable deals on Russian natural resources and I kind of suspect Americans would find having universal health care more important than deciding who administers Donetsk..
Not quite. NATO members could could still let them in by unanimous agreement. There are no hard rules beyond that.
Instead, we'll refocus our energy purchasing towards countries who are wholly incompatible culturally?
E.g. Russia, albeit possessing good aircrafts, it never does such trainings, most you'll see in Syria or Ukraine are pilots flying in pairs. That's part of Russian military doctrine, as they always assumed since Soviet times that NATO forces would dominate the sky, thus they never developed actively such capabilities, but instead focused on anti aircraft and mechanized forces.
