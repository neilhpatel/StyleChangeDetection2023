I'll take a swing at this, but I'll also flag it to /u/qhapaqocha's attention. Always great to read that redditor's answers!
The Inca didn't just "decide" that it wasn't worth conquering the Mapuche; they sent tens of thousands of soldiers, led by the capable general Sinchiruca, to conquer Mapuche lands, and were defeated by a similarly populous force in either a single gigantic battle or a few relatively smaller ones. They also had good reason to try and conquer Mapuche areas -.
Absolutely. It was pretty impressive how much manpower the Inca could point at any problem. There's one siege on the coast where it is said the Inca built a miniature Cuzco out in the desert so they could continue all the functions of court while waiting out the people in an unassailable hillfort. The Inca spent more on building and maintaining a temporary replica capital than the tribe would ever contribute to the Empire, but they did it as a show of their commitment. How many coastal rebellions never happened because the Inca demonstrated they would bring the full weight of their empire down on whoever acted up?
