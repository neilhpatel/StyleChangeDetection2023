There's a lot ignorant folks in America to back these guys up, but they stand for nothing. I'm not a democrat but I stand for democracy. Trump stands for nothing except what will benefit him. His political usary will decimate the Republican Party until they recreate themselves. We need the Republican Party to exist as choice, but they have betrayed their core values for the vote of a deranged populous. Democracy is still strong but it's at a necessary phase where attention to it will make it stronger. I'll wager voter turnout is stronger in 2024 than 2020, which favors the middle class more than Republican or Democrat and should really be everybody's focus. Voter turnout is significantly correlated with income where the more money you make, the more likely you are to vote. When pleasing the rich is no longer a factor we finally solve the problems in America. The only reason the US doesn't have universal healthcare is because low voter turnout.
