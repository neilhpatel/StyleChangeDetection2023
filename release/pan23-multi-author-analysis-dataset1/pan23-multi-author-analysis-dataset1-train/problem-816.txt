The water line needs to be below the frost line when on private property, nothing else. It doesn't matter how shallow that pipe is, even if it's not below the frost line because once it crosses the shut off valve off the main line it becomes private property and can be done with how the owner wants, as long as it doesn't affect anything on the other side if the shut off valve. This is also why it wasn't marked. They will only make what they "own" so really only up to the shut off on their side.
Industry-standard is a contractor is not responsible for damage to underground utilities/lines especially if not marked.
I'm so glad you asked. 25 years in a combination of residential and commercial both in the field and the office doing bid solicitation, verification and accounting. In the last 8 month alone I have completely replumbed a house. Fixed at least 5 broken lines and run more than 1000 ft of irrigation. You might be a good operator but I'll match my experience against yours without hesitation in this instance.
