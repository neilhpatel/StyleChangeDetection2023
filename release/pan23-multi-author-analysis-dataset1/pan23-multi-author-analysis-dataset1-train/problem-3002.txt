I’m positive that strategies predate the theories but that doesn’t mean they are good strategies. A strategy is just a decision rule; if X happens do Y. By gathering sufficient statistics on strategy A and strategy B you can empirically compare and say with good confidence that one is better than the other. Do that enough times and you may end up with a decent strategy. But if you are going to invest that much time in trying to figure out a good strategy maybe it’s just easier to cheat?
So while one could maybe come up with a good strategy for a game, how does one show it is actually optimal by just relying on examples? No amount or examples can guarantee a better strategy does not exist in some situations. Or maybe there is no winning strategy at all - how does one show that just by having massive amounts of data? The genius of humans is in using data to get intuition that allows us in some situations to very intelligently chop up the hypothesis space of a problem in ways that we could only dream of our computers being able to. But in the case of gambling games that would probably amount to formulating theories and defining the proper mathematical definitions of probability theory.
Noughts and crosses comes to mind. Children learn and then abandon this game as they realise that there are a limited number of strategies.
