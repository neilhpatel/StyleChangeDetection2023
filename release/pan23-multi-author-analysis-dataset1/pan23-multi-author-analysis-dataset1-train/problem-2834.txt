I will echo the other commenters and say history is not perfect when it comes to discrimination. I just finished my MA in ancient history, specifically the Roman Empire. One of the archaeology PhDs had to have a pretty frank conversation with his professor, because he has quite a significant speech impediment and quite poor interpersonal skills. She basically had to tell him that he is very unlikely to be hired as a university level teacher in any capacity with his speech impediment, because it would be very difficult for him to keep students engaged with the subject matter. So be honest with yourself and consider whether being an academic is a viable path with your autism. As the other guy said, maybe it won't be a problem.
Most of what is most obviously a "history job" (museums, professorial roles and the like) are extremely sought after, to the point where museums have partnered with some universities to create "museum studies" type degrees to run the place. Because these jobs are so highly sought after they are incredibly difficult to get into, and usually the jobs open up because someone is retiring or moving up to take the role of a retiree.
