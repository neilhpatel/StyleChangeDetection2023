I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.
I used to think people in the 80s were so gullible for falling for all that Cold War rhetoric but then I saw a Reddit comment with thousands of upvotes saying something along the lines of “our enemies in the East are strategically using various sized balloons to test our capabilities for a bombing campaign” and then I got it.
But it saved me. All my girlfriends demanded some public gesture to prove they were my only since I’m always with mama all Valentine’s Day. Usually I just ghost them all and start over. Not this year!
