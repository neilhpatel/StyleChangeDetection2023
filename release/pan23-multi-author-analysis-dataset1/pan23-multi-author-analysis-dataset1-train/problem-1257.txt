does not allow employers to retain employees' tips for any reason other than as part of a valid tip pooling arrangement (and all such pooled tips must be distributed to non-management employees; the business owner or management cannot keep any tips from such a pool). While federal law does permit employers to deduct the cost of payment processing for the amount of the tip itself (though never to cover the cost of processing the entire payment for the meal or service in general, only the amount of the tip itself), CA law does not permit such a deduction at all.
>No. Labor Code Section 351 provides that the employer must pay the employee the full amount of the tip that is indicated on the credit card. The employer may not make any deduction for credit card processing fees or costs that are charged to the employer by the credit card company from gratuities paid to the employee.
California does not allow taking credit card processing fees from employee tips even the amount to process the tip.
