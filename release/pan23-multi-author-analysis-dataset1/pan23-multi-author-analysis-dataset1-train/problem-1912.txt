If he says "Well, we have a deal that I can take the kid" she can say "Not anymore we don't. You're not taking the kid again until you tell me where you're taking it or until you get a court order saying you can take the kid.".
Is there anything in the custody or co-parenting agreement that stipulates either parent must inform the other of a change of residence or taking the child out-of-state temporarily? If not, then no. Neither of you are required to do anything that is not stipulated in the aforementioned agreements. You can contact the courts or entities involved and request the new address, but they may be inclined to deny you that information without a proper motion or hearing. This is all generic, because we donâ€™t know where this is taking place, which is potentially the only pertinent piece of information we need to offer anything more than speculation. Good luck!
If the father says "Judge, I wanted to take the kid somewhere without telling her, and she wouldn't agree, so I'm coming to you asking for a court order that I can take the kid where I want without telling her," the judge isn't going to to sympathetic to the father at all.
Telling a client like her "you have no right to know where the father is taking the kids" without also telling her "but you don't have to let him take the kid at all without a court order" is just bad lawyering.
