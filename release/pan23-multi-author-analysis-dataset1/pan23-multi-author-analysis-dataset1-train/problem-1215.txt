That is just her opinion. International maritime law says something different. Both the flag state and the coastal states have a responsibility to work together to find a solution in case the ship cannot find a port that is willing to allow the people they rescued disembark.
As I said: According to international maritime law both the flag state and the coastal states have a responsibility to work together to find a solution in case the ship cannot find a port that is willing to allow the people they rescued disembark. Them being stuck on the vessel that rescued them is not a solution. It's also just not going to work. At some point supplies will run out.
The "solution" of the NGOs is to twist Italy's arm until it literally has to choose between letting the migrants die or allowing them to disembark, they're contributing to nothing but exasperation and hate against immigrants growing in Italy because they are let in by engaging in emotional blackmail.
