I thought that was for if mine AND hers were on the registration. I definitely could've gotten bad information but could you explain why that is not the case?
Again, registration doesn't denote ownership. How this all works varies by state. I am under the impression that for your name to be on the registration, it would first have to be on the title, but I could be wrong about how NM works. .
Legal guardiansÂ have custody of the children and the authority to make decisions concerning the protection, education, care, discipline, etc.
I'm not in her care though. Could you elaborate on that please. Does her being my legal guardian mean that I'm legally in her care? I'm 17 btw. 4 months from being 18.
ownership is joint tenancy with an expressed intent that either of the owners has full authority to transfer ownership of the vehicle, license plates and/or fees or to record loan information. To transfer ownership of the vehicle, license plates and/or fees to record loan information, the signature of either party will be accepted. Both signatures are not required.
