In short, do not talk to these people. Do not say anything to them about the debt and don't sign anything from them about the debt. If they persist and become a nuisance or start taking aggressive (or potentially illegal) steps, start looking for a local attorney who specializes in representing consumers in Fair Debt Collection Practices Act matters. There is a cottage industry for such lawyers and most are genuinely helpful. The applicable laws provide avenues for them to recover expenses and legal fees in successful actions brought against collectors under the federal and state acts, so there is a viable legal practice for some who specialize in handling matters like this.
Don't acknowledge the debt. Don't do a "partial payment.". Your only statement should be "we don't owe it and even if we did, it's beyond the statute and is uncollectible.". They may try to convince you otherwise, but they will be lying. (Lowlifes trying to collect on debt like this will lie through their teeth.).
As u/Boo-n-BeansMom suggested below, you should do an hour or two of internet research on "zombie debt" and its interaction with both the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and California Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (which covers a wider class of "collectors" and provide additional protections beyond the federal statute).
You don't owe due to the statute of limitations. But keep an eye on your credit scores. If this company somehow attaches this debt to your scores, you need to dispute it.
