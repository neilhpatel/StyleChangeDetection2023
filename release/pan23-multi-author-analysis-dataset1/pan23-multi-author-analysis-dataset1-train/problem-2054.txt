Ok you wanna talk about colonization for centuries, sure thing. Let’s talk about china. Let’s talk about South Korea. I can name quite a few countries that had it far worse than India and managed to come out the other side into 2023 looking pretty good. I hate to break it you, but colonization didn’t just affect india and there are wealthy countries today that were dealt a shit hand and spun straw into gold. But I understand that runs counter to the victim complex India has built itself to evade even possibly considering its own actions that might have hindered growth and development.
Edit: Like this is great news to me. It's not India that's bombing civilians and as of now India hasn't directly aided Russia's war. I am hoping they never directly aid Russia's war and I hope they continue to manipulate the situation to help indians.
Buying Russia's resources because it directly benefits indians is not the same as directly aiding Russia's war.
When it's this small? You're forgetting that's the 5th largest country by GDP percentile at 3.4 percent. Sure it's small by US standards but has basically doubled from 1.4 percent in 2000.
