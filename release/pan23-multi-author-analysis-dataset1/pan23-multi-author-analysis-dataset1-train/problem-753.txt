To the person who said Bernie: Im a lifelong progressive who went all-in on Bernie, twice. I love the guy, I love his policies but he is also too old at this point. We can’t keep going for these geriatric candidates who were literally raised during eras totally unrelatable to today’s culture and hold sentiments that are just behind the times.
And Shapiro had an easy win. Then-US Senator Barack Hussein Obama proved his political skills by somehow winning the Iowa caucuses against then-US Senator Hillary Clinton and the Clinton machine even though then-US Senator Obama is a black guy with the middle name "Hussein".
I agree on the rest. Whitmer right now stands above the rest. (Speaking of governors, I wonder if Murphy is interested... His last term ends in January, '24.).
California Governor Gavin Newsom hasn't managed California well. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger very easily brushed off any recall nonsense. Most Californians would prefer Jerry Brown was still the Governor. Newsom simply road Brown's coattails.
