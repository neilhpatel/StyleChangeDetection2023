The same way that painting over it would be. If it is not yours and/or you lack the owners permission you have no legal right to alter/deface/damage property in this manner.
There is no legal difference between paint and stickers when used to alter/deface/damage the property of others without their permission. Both can usually be removed with varying degrees of difficulty and both are usually considered vandalism. Just don't.
From a legal standpoint, defacing someone else’s property, even if to cover up other unwanted advertisements or art (another thin line with sketchy legal definitions) generally counts as vandalism. The trick would be to get the property owner’s permission.
Interesting perspective. I have a scenario for you to consider which doesn't even involve damage to your car. If I wrapped your car tightly in clear plastic wrap and it took you 5 minutes to unwrap it and dispose of it, would you be cool with that? And would it make a difference whether I attached a poster to it with an explanation why or instead just left you guessing? Would you feel the same about your wrapped car whether the posted explanation was "Big Oil and Electric Vehicles are destroying Mother Earth" or "Watching artists unwrap their cars brings me tremendous joy" Would you be cool with it if I did this to your car every day?
