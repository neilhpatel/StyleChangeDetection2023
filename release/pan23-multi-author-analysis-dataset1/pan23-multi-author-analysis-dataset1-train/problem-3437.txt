Are you an "ethnic Ukrainian" or an "ethnic Russian" if you come from both sides of the border - which is the case for many, many people in Russia and Ukraine?
We largely define ourselves by our nationality (with the exclusion of ethnic minorities like Crimean Tatars, Cossacks of Don or of Zaporozhye etc) and not our ethnicity. Given the shared history of our two countries, it's nearly impossible to even determine it. The poster above was most likely referring to the Russian-speaking people from the eastern parts of Ukraine (they were evacuated the most) who nevertheless define themselves as Ukrainians, so calling them "ethnically Russian" would be incorrect and even kinda crass tbh. It is also the basis of Putin's propaganda and the backlash of a Ukrainian one: Russian-speaking Ukrainians from the East (especially Donbass territory) are often marginalised and called "rusnya" (racist slur for Russians) by their Ukrainian-speaking compatriots, so it's just hurtful all around.
We live in the Netherlands. My GF signed up with a help organization. We met the prospective guests and then had a trial weekend. We have a grandma, mother and teenage boy staying with us. Officially its for 3 months at a time and after the 3 konths, if both sides agree, it can be extended. They had already asked us before the first 3 months where up and we agreed.
Relatives. A lot of Ukrainians have relatives in Russia, seeing that we used to be one country at some point, and after the division the border control and immigration policy were very lax until about 2012-14. Think like Canada-US interconnectedness, it's about the same - used to be.
