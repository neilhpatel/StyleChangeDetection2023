I guess I’m just being paranoid about why someone would do this and I was wondering if there was some sort of other legal action I am supposed to take or if I should just forget about it. The damage was temporary so I guess.
It could’ve been something deliver it it could’ve been something accidental where they thought your car with somebody else’s or it could’ve just been something random, it doesn’t really matter because without a clear idea of who did it nothing can be done and even if you did have a clear idea of who did it the most that you would be able to do is collect money for cleaning your car up wakes it doesn’t sound like what’s the significant amount of money maybe a half hours worth of time and then possibly gotten a restraining order which is a shot in the dark because it sounds like this was a single action and there is no threat to your life or a real threat to your property so it’s questionable as to whether or not a judge would actually issue one.
It’s not too big of a deal. It was just creepy that someone would do that and potentially call my phone about it.
