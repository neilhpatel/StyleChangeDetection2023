>“Corporate crime—in the form of illegal pollution, fraud, reckless endangerment of consumers and workers, cartels, systematic rip-offs, and more—remains rampant, but corporate criminal prosecutions are at historically low levels," Public Citizen president Robert Weissman said at the time. "It's time to end leniency deals for corporate wrongdoers. Corporations are the ultimate rational actors: If they know the costs of breaking the law are worth it for expected monetary gain, then they will break the law—irrespective of the societal damage.".
Ppl seem to forget that the DOJ operates on timelines of like 3-5 years at a minimum when it comes to corporate cases, completely unsurprising that they haven’t filed a lot of indictments as they’re likely still doing initial investigatory work on cases started under Garland.
Yawn... its adorable you think the system isnt totally broken. What do you think all the Cons do when their in office? Bill barr is a perfect example, dude literally slathered his lipstick all over drumpf's tiny pecker... not to mention the supreme court which is now packed with cons who either actively participated in Jan 6 or were complicit in overturning roe... so remind me again how it's not broken? It's so cute when liberals act like we should be above getting in the shit with these monsters. And just to show you I'm equal opportunity how come eric holder and Obama didnt prosecute anyone other than countrywide for driving our economy off a cliff in 2008?
