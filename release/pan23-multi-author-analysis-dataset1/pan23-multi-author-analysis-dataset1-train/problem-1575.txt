A very avant-garde theory, it seems - nothing in terms of Ibsen's character, it's all the impersonal social forces! .
Some specialist, like Jean-Pierre Sarrazac, have shown that there has been a massive shift in the way we write drama since the end of the XIXth century, and that Ibsen/Strinberg/tchekhov really invented a new form of drama, still influencial to this day. To summarize : before, theatre was mostly written according to the aristotelician model : a play was an interpersonal action in the present, with character that were individual, well-defined figures. After that, all those notions - plot, characters, the idea that the action happens in the present etc. - became more and more complicated. This, according to Sarrazac, was Ibsen's invention. At first glance his dramas seem quite classical ; but if you look closely you'll remark that what was the core of previous drama - the plot advancing in the present - is mostly missing because \everything happened before the first scene\. A lot of Ibsen play are just a present in which the past resurface ; the characters are haunted more than they're actors of their life. For people like Sarrazac, this is the reason Ibsen should be considered like (one of) the inventor of modern drama that spanned the whole XXth century.
