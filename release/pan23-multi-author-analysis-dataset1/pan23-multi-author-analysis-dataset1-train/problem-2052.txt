In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I agree with you. I recognized democracy was dead in Texas in the mid-aughts, so I left Texas. I'm legit surprised more people don't do the same. Life is too short to live in a fascist state.

“Knowledge-Based Education – We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.”.
💯 Yup. It’s obvious. They’re going all in on hating everyone else because they know they’re losers and want to keep others down so they can pretend that they’re not actually losers. Their biggest fear now is “great replacement”. So they’re basically just saying even if people want something better we have to stay with them anyway just because. It’s insane so many people want to usher in actual fcking fascism rather than just go to therapy.
