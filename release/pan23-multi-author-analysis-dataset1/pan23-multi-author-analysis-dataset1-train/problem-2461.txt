If there is no specific period to your request, I can recommend Owen Lattimore's paper titled "Origins of the Great Wall of China: A Frontier Concept in Theory and Practice" which is available in JSTOR.
Cool! So regarding this period, probably the best overview of the Ming strategy in their construction of the Great Wall is Arthur Waldron's eponymous book on the subject. Regarding the Qing period there's a whole host of works on the Qing approach to their frontiers: Peter C. Perdue's China Marches West is probably the best general overview, but there's a couple of more specialised works that I'd also recommend â€“ Laura Hostetler's Qing Colonial Enterprise: Ethnography and Cartography in Early Modern China and James Millward's Beyond the Pass: Economy, Ethnicity and Empire in Qing Central Asia, 1759-1864. A particularly useful framing piece can be found in Perdue's chapter to ed. Nicola di Cosmo, Military Culture in Imperial China, titled 'Coercion and Commerce on Two Chinese Frontiers', which argues for viewing the landward and coastal frontiers in conjunction rather than as wholly distinct entities.
