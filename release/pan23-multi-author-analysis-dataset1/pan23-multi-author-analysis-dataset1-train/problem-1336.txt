Spare me the fake outrage. 154,000 e-mails on Hunter Biden's laptop and the most incriminating thing anyone could find after years and years of promises was nothing from Hunter himself but a friend of Hunter who said 10% of an unknown sum to the "big guy" who no one even knows who it's referring to. That gotta be as close to squeaky clean as you can get... Wow, Joe Biden potentially knew about some kind of arrangement and potentially benefited from it... but no one really knows and it's peanuts we're talking about anyway. Really hard hitting stuff here. .
Ever since the '60s with Nixon and then on to Reagan, the Republican Party has increasingly moved in the direction of prioritizing business and capital interest over the common person and courting as many hateful racist sexist religous-fascists type voters as possible to maintain a slim hold on power through gerrymandering.
Was it? Also, Russians literally hacked those emails and released them, and it still wasn't really true that the primaries were rigged.
