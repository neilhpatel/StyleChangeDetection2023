Yeah I lived through a large earthquake in Indonesia and learned a lot about earthquakes in the aftermath. The truly scary part is not knowing if youve already felt the main quake or it it's still to come.
Meteorologist here. I do active warnings for tornadoes and severe storms. Recently had an event in my state where numerous people died, including a 9 year old. It sticks with you. The secondary trauma of being directly part of the emergency response process is very real. Take care of yourself friend, and thanks for getting info to people.
Devastating. I'm not Turkish but I've been following the country more closely for a few years. There is so much unnecessary suffering brought on by an inept and corrupt government and now this disaster. I'm not optimistic but I hope this will help bring the change the people of Turkey need and deserve.
Absolutely appreciate you. Living in the PNW we are pretty aware of the potential for quakes here and definitely would want you - or someone like you- to keep us informed.
