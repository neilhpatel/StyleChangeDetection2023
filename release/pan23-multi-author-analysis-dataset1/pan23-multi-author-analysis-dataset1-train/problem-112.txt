The Federal Government is permitted to put reasonable requirements on continued employment with the Agency. In most cases after one year of employment with the Federal Government you have a "property interest" in your job and are entitled to due process before you are removed, but that doesn't mean that the Government cannot impose vaccine requirements. Vaccine requirements have been upheld for over 100 years. There may be questions as to if the requirement for private employers is valid, there are not similar questions with regards to the requirement for federal employees. You can and will be terminated if you do not prove your vaccine status.
Right, understandable. And as I've said, not here to get political or discuss the vaccination. If it helps at all, my concern isn't the vaccine itself but where I can see this going and being required to receive boosters every so often in order to keep my job. I got vaccinated when it was my choice. I just don't see mandating something like this as the best approach. I've seen instances where it takes a year to fire an employee who was an alcoholic and ultimately just stopped showing up for work all together. I was just wondering if they could in fact have the capability to terminate over something that just came in effect, with no written laws in place yet.
