In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yeah. A GOP sweetheart can call for the constitution to be the ended and the GOP base doesn't care. There is no such thing as a GOP scandal that the GOP base cares about. Before you mention Kanye - Desantis was asked to speak against nazi's when Florida was seeing demonstrations from swatzika wearing Nazis. Desantis refused- he didn't want to insult his base, I guess. Kanye is getting blowback from his controversy within the GOP only because he is not a GOP sweetheart.
