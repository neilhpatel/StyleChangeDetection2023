I've done this with my parents and the thing is, we agree on more things than we disagree on, for the most part. Part of the issue though might be just a fundamental difference in programmed values - conservatives in general don't want anyone to have anything for "free." It's a fairness thing to them, they can't see the whole picture where the people mooching off the system are largely insignificant. They are hyper-focused on and extremely offended by the idea that anyone would get something they didn't work for.
