However everything is on dashcam with audio and it has night vision, so I'm in the clear regarding any sexual misconduct. I literally said I'm flattered but no thank you, I keep work and that stuff separate. When he wanted to touch my dick. I didn't flirt with him or lead him on or anything.
I would say report the sexual harassment but this timeline makes it seem like you are only reporting him in retaliation for him reporting you for speeding, which he did in retaliation for you charging him the inconvenience fee for the damages. I would be worried that he would try to turn it around and report you for some sort of sexual misconduct or other accused illegal activity. The fact that you knowingly drove him to pick up cocaine makes me a little nervous about how that could be construed. We can give advice based on the law, but we cannot tell you what Uber would do. In this instance perhaps it would be best to stop this back and forth now without further escalation. He paid for the damage, which may have actually been caused by the cleaning chemical you used. I would call it even and move on in order to avoid risking some sort of adverse action from Uber or headache from law enforcement.
