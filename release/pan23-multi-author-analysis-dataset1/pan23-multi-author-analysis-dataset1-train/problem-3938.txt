It’s 7pm PST. I’m looking on NYT and seeing Democrats pretty much on track to win 20 seats, not counting the Cali seats that I feel like it’s too early to tell. If Dems can get 4 additional seats (AZ 1, AZ 6, CA 3, CA 13, CA 22, CA 41, CA 45?, haha CO 3), they get control of the House. Is this feasible or even being discussed? Is there actually a world where Dems get all 3?
