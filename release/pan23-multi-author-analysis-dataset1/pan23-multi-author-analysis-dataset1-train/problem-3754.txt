Also before the OP goes off declaring they found the chair for less, it might be good to ensure that they are buying from the manufacture and not some knock off. I've actually had to buy chairs for a preschool and there were multiple sites (wayfair, target, Walmart) who had these chairs online. However, upon talking to people buying furniture those were not legitimately from the manufacturer. Even though they claimed to be.
There may be some other law, but before you hire a lawyer for several hundred dollars an hour to sue the school over $40 per student, you'd be better off trying a moral argument with the principal or if they've refused to hear your argument, the school board that it's unfair to charge students more for the chair than it costs the school to replace it, or that you should be allowed to replace the chair directly rather than paying the school to do so. Or argue the unfairness of requiring all of you to pay for an already broken chair, if your evidence of the hair being broken is strong enough.
