Our written evidence for the Maurya is limited. That’s at least in part due to the massive upheavel during following centuries, which led to the loss of many sources. Its existence is still corroborated by several Greek writers and surviving texts like the Arthashastra. While problematic in a variety of ways (Arthashastra has probably been interloped by later writers, and the Greek writers often repeat third hand information), it’s enough to verify broad swathes of the Mauryan history detailed in Buddhist and Jain texts, minus the more religious claims. Certainly Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the dynasty, existed and led a revolt which toppled the existing Nanda Dynasty in Pataliputra. He then began a conquest which took much of the subcontinent. His sucessors followed this model and continued to expand. Their creation of infrastructure like roads, a uniform currency, encouragement of long distance trade, maintenance of a central army, and governance of a large, multi-lingual and multi-ethnic territory are what makes them an ‘empire,’ although the rulers referred to themselves as raja, usually translated as king.
Very interesting! I thought the Brahmi alphabet being derived from the Aramaic one was more or less settled except for some holdout nationalist arguments about it. With respect to Zoroastrian influence, I would think the Kushan Empire would potentially be a more likely source of that (since there's a lot of material showing syncretisms of Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Hellenic religion, Near Eastern religion, and Vedic Religion/Proto-Hinduism around then).
Great to see a question about an interesting time and figure! I’ve been doing a lot of research on Ashoka and the Maurya Empire lately, and I currently have an article on the collapse of its currency system under review by a journal.
