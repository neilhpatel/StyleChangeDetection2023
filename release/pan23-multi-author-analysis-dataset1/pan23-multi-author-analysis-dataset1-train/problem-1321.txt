By separating Berlin into allied sectors, the allied powers could ensure a consistent weakening of the role of Berlin in German politics and economics (and thus its ascribed militarism) while keeping a close eye on the cultural liberalisation of Prussian culture (as the allies saw it). Clark points out correctly (pp. 675ff) that only the Soviet Union noticed the marked difference between the idea of Prussia (a constitutional law based state) and the ideology of Nazism, while the Western allies (in particular the British) tended to lump it all glaringly into one "militarist" basket.
All three are quite good in showing how in particular the conservatives and the military itself attempted to depict militarism as the "natural" mindset of the German nation within and to the outer world, when the actual public was often actually quite opposed to it (especially when you hear the voices from the political left at the time).
Thank you this has been very informative. Do you perchance know of any books or articles that cover militarism/attitudes to the military in Prussia (and maybe in comparisson to places like the UK).
