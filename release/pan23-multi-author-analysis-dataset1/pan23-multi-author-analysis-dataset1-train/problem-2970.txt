Not all investors specifically buy houses to rent them out but a lot do, if you put a cap on rent then these investors would likely pull out of the UK market what would see a massive drop in house prices across the UK what the government do not want to see has this will effect the economy.
You are not wrong. I work in the food service industry. Other day someone ordered a pizza with just about every topping on it so I looked at the receipt and with the delivery charge/before tip it was like $50 US. Fuck that I'm not paying 50 bucks for 1 pizza.
The problem what is happening now these investors are seeing they can make money so they are increasing prices across the board and with housing prices dropping but nobody can afford to buy houses due to the financial crisis the rich will buy more houses and rent them out with high rent prices, working people already struggling are simply giving more money to greedy fat cunts because they have no other choice.
Its not even indirect. The UK government has not for 25 years done something that might lower house prices. In the same way the US government bends over for the stock market, the UK government bends over for the real estate market.
