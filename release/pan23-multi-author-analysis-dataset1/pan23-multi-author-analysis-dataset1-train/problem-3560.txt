In sum, most people had teeth worn down from chewing poorly processed foods. The horizontal lines, however, are intentional modifications, most often seen on the top incisors (front teeth). They would have taken time and care, but they probably wouldn't have been terribly painful in the making, nor should they have caused eating to have been painful in the long run. While they seem prominent on museum pieces today, they were pretty rare during the generation or so when they were made, and they would have only occasionally been visible even to people who knew to look for them. We don't know why they did it, although finds suggest that it might have been a small subculture of young men who engaged in viking activity around the year 1000. Don't try this at home!
Hmm, I wonder - and maybe this is stretching it - but is this indicative at all that the Jomsvikings weren't unique at the time as being a sorta non-kinship-related civil organization or corporation? In Viking-age-inspired media, they're the only sort of organization that tends not-to-be-all-from-one-village or organized-around-an-agenda aside from the 'state' itself.
