You do need a government body to manage this. However with technology you could work a more efficient work around. I live in Mexico we have our own terroristic IRS called the SAT, they are so paranoid that you are embezzling them they came up with a system called CFDI or electronic invoice. They know in realtime what you buy/sell since in mexico we have a Tax called IVA that is 16% on almost all goods and services. Companies need to carry that tax and pay it at the end of every month. This way the government knows every sales tax, they even know how much inventory you have at hand. Stock brokerages are withholding your tax so the burden is passed to companies that have accounting teams and more accountability than individuals. This is repressive in its current form but maybe the US could use a similar system to simplify tax payments for regular people, itâ€™s ridiculous that a person making maybe 50,000 a year needs to spend 500usd on having his tax made by an accountant or turbo tax.
Weak effort. Might as well pass a bill to just dissolve the government entirely. Go big or go home.
If the opinion editorial itself were particularly well-supported, it might be okay, but this one uses weasel words in the paragraph that makes the claim you cite (saying "economists warned" and "economists said" without citing the specific economists). The only real source explicitly mentioned is the ProPublica report, which only indirectly supports your claim.
