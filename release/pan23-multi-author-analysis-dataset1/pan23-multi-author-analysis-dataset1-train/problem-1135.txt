H. P. Lovecraft saw the film The Golem in 1921; based on the 1915 novel by Gustav Meyrink, Lovecraft thought the film faithful to the book, which he had never read as it was relatively scarce. In 1925 he began to write his essay "Supernatural Fiction in Literature," which was published in 1927. He immediately began compiling notes for a fuller version, which was not completely published within his lifetime.
B. Move to the other side and recommend books on the history of the U.S. I \think\ I am more interested in colonial times and up to the revolution. Multiple books concerning each period are welcome. Of course general recommendations are welcome too.
Historiography is important. Understanding how historical narratives have changed, both in the general sense of how history is written and in the particular area of your interest, will be incredibly useful even if you don't realise it at first. Basically every undergrad I know would point budding historians to E. H. Carr's What is History? or Richard Evans' In Defence of History, but I've personally found the most useful exercises in historiography to be books specifically relevant to the Taiping and Qing with strong historiographical elements. Paul A. Cohen's Discovering History in China and William T. Rowe's China's Last Empire have proven invaluable in this regard.
