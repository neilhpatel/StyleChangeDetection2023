AL allows minors over 14 to consent. So depending on where you are in FL, if you have transportation, and you could get away from your home for long enough to make the trip without issue, that could be an option. You would have to find somewhere that is okay with vaccinating non-residents, so you'd need to call around, also as to what type of ID is required. Keep in mind that because you can only get Pfizer, you'd need to do this twice.
As vaccine development in general, and deployment of this particular set of vaccines in particular, continues apace, further testing and clinical trials (I confidently suspect) will also continue, and I think that will include development of even newer vaccines that (I earnestly hope) will also strive to close the pediatric-vaccination-gap that I've noticed in several independent offline contexts in my life (as a significant example, there is a school bus company in my city that is wrestling with the idea of mandating its workers to be vaccinated, and what the absence of a mandate would mean for the students that they carry on their buses.).
Edit: Their resource guide specifically highlights that "Regardless of state vaccine consent laws, minors can receive some health care services without parental consent in Title X-funded clinics. [...] Call a nearby clinic to see if they will administer vaccinations without parental consent or your state health department for more information".
