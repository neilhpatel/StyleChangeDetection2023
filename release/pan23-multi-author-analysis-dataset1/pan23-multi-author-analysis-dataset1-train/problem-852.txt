The most obvious alignment for Jews was to support the authoritarian, Christian government. The choice was clear, because the most likely successor to.
According to Timothy Pytell's article (which the commenter mentions, it's called "The Missing Pieces of the Puzzle: A Reflection on the Odd Career of Viktor Frankl", published in 2000), Frankl worked as a psychiatrist in Theresienstadt and helped new arrivals acclimate to ghetto life. He also established what Pytell called a "suicide intelligence network," intended to identify and intervene with people suspected of being suicidal. Preventing suicide seemed to be one of Frankl's highest goals, so this makes sense. However, suicide in Theresienstadt was strictly forbidden, it also served the Nazis' purpose of keeping prisoners alive under unbearable conditions so their labor could be exploited. Since Frankl was a doctor and appears to have been involved in the administration of the public health department at Theresienstadt, he may have had access to certain benefits that prisoners lower than he in the internal hierarchy wouldn't have had. He would have also been faced with morally fraught choices. Again, I think it's grotesque to say that this would make Frankl a Nazi collaborator.
