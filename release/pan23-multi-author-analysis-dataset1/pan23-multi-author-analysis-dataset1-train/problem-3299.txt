"Streisand filed a lawsuit against photographer Kenneth Adelman and Pictopia.com for violation of privacy after his aerial photograph of her mansion featured in the publicly available archive of 12,000 California coastline photographs. Before the $50 million lawsuit was registered, “Image 3850” had been downloaded from his website only six times, two of which were done by Streisand’s lawyers. However, if Adelman had merely jumped the fence, public knowledge of the case obliterated it altogether. The following month, more than 420,000 people visited the archive and downloaded the picture.".
