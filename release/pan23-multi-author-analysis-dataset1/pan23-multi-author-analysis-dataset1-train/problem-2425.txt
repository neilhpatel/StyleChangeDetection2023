I work with builders throughout the state of Texas and specifically in that area so I have a few suggestions for you, please note IANAL but work for a vendor. First would be to escalate this to the builders main office because the construction site manager is trying to avoid making costly changes which will directly affect his bonus and if he can get you to just walk away then he can re-classify it as a spec home.
Well, wait a minute. When you say the "incorrect" floorplan is attached to the contract, do you mean the floorplan they are building, the one you don't like, is the floor plan you agreed to buy?
Are they building according to a different existing floor plan sold to customers and does that floor plan have a lower price than the one you bought? Or are they just butchering the floor plan you bought and haven't switched to correctly build a different floor plan?
What does the contract say about what floor plan you were buying? You may have the right to back out and sue them for your damages, or keep the house, have another contractor fix it when they're done, and sue them for damages.
Perhaps tell them to fix it or you'll get someone else to fix it and bill them, which is going to cost them a lot more than fixing it themselves.
