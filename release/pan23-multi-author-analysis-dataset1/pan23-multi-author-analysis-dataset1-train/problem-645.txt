This was bumbled in every place. Gavi never should have made such large orders without the downline mechanisms in place. They left themselves holding the ball with nowhere to pass it.

Interesting. You're trying to pretend a pithy offhand statement defines a system of commerce and industry. Good luck with that.
Would it be very moral and appropriate for all companies to make recompense for the financial loss being experienced by organizations and countries that overbought an ultimately unused product? Sure. Should it be demanded? Not really. That kind of requirement needs strict regulation and coordination that doesn't exist on a global scale. It would be great to see global entities learn from this to avoid entering into disadvantageous contracts and instead be able to position themselves before the highest bidders through some form of globally accepted regulations based on great social needs rather than primarily financial ones.
No one was forced into it. If they wanted to wait for better terms they could have. But they didn't want to. They were told not to by the entities that gave them the money to purchase the vaccines.
