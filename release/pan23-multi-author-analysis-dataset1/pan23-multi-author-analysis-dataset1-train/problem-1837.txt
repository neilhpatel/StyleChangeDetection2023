This is largely not true. As evidence to this fact, I'm going to highlight some key diversions early Muslim scholars made from Aristotelian economic thought, as well as show many of their own, original, contributions to the field.
Drawing again from Hosseini, what he attributes Aristotle's chief economic influence to is more the broader intellectual approach Aristotle took than to his particular economic views, if that makes sense. He claims the scholars I reference above "reflected Greek rationality, a sense of realism and practicality" but yet "produced theories closer to the economic concepts of the more recent centuries than those of the Greeks or pre-modern Latin Christianity." If I had to come up with a crude analogy, it would be more 'using some of Aristotle's tools to create a largely-different product' as opposed to building their own ideas on top of his. As I tried to highlight in my top-level answer, a great deal of the economic writing of the Muslim scholars doesn't really have a linear relationship to any of Aristotle's own economic ideas, and many of them come into direct conflict with what he personally believed (such as with regards to wealth accumulation).
First, thanks a lot. Second, it seems to me, based on your answer, that early muslim scholars used the ideas of Aristotle about economics as a base but they differed from those ideas greatly, thus making their own valuable contributions to this field.
No worries! I'm very excited to have the privilege of being able to provide an answer in this wonderful subreddit.
