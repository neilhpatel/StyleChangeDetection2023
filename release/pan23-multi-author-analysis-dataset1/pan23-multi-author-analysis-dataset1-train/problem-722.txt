The changes during this settlement basically fixed the issues seen during the years of 27 BC - 23 BC. Firstly, Augustus stepped down from the consulship position. Whilst this did not effect his formal powers regarding the provinces of Caesar (as he had imperium proconsulare, it did reduce his power in the provinces of the Roman people. Thus, his imperium proconsulare is declared superior to other holders of imperium and became imperium proconsulare maius which allowed Augustus to command the governors of the provinces of the Roman people. Secondly, the removal of his consular powers means that Augustus did not have the ability to assemble the senate and people's senate, nor propose and pass laws. Therefore, the senate granted Augustus tribunicia potestas which gave him the powers of the tribune of the plebs without holding office, allowing him to introduce legislation and take action such as vetoing the actions of other magistrates.
I guess that makes sense then yes. At the very least I think the distinction between the Principate and the Dominate is a good one.
