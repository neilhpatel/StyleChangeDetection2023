Well I think he either loses or starts ww3 and we all lose. I don't see a world in which he wins a war in ukraine, potentially other places he deems part of russia, and the world sits by to let him. It's less about what the stats are, and more about what is inevitable. The US is not slowing down its aid, and who knows what's coming of biden's kyiv trip. China may or may not choose to back russia, and who knows how far "backing" will go, but it's easy to imagine a point where US and Chinese troops are active in eastern europe. We're not going to dump billions into helping out ukraine and then go "ah well that didn't work out, let's go home".
The main difference between authoritarian governments and stable Democracies is that authoritarians value loyalty above competence while stable, developed Democracies fill most positions based on experience and competence. This is why dictators tend to make mlsorse decisions as time goes on--an echo chamber of sycophantic yes men give a very inaccurate view of reality.
