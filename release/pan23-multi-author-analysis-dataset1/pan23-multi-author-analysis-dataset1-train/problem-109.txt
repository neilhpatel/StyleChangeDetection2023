Very much like today, the knowledge of how to construct domes like the pantheon was known and taught only by the people who were concerned with it, aka it wasn't within the public sphere of knowledge. For example - if suddenly tomorrow all the engineers and architects in the world passed away, the average person wouldn't know how to do all the things that they did without having to deeply study and understand engineering.
Thank you very much! I am a first year student in history, and your insight has made me curious about architectural history. However, I have a follow-up question if possible: do you happen to know where those books by Vitruvius were stored? And if so, what for?

To give an idea of the associated speculation among historians, they are usually simplistically presented as piratical marauders who destroyed many of these urban centres, but it may have referred to a wide variety of peoples - possibly hostile migrations of Dorians to southern Greece and Philistines to the area of what would be Israel, that might be traced to this era, have been linked to these by some (not in any watertight way!), and various hints of names have been tied to particular peoples, including Cypriots, other Greeks and Indo-Europeans, etc. We don’t know very much. It’s quite possible that a chain of events started by drought and then a domino effect of chaotic migrations of many peoples, which we have seen from the Germanic migrations to many Steppes migrations, may have been at play, and may have been a cause, an effect, or both, of this broad collapse.
Again, the causes seem complex, are debated, may be due in great part to drought, and are roughly contemporaneous worth massive migrations that used to be more simplistically blamed.
