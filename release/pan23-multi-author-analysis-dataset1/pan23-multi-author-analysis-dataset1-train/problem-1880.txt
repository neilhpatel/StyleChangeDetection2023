NAL, I would tell him for non legal reasons. The client possibly getting away with said offenses could damage family relations and I would say it is morally just to give him that choice beforehand. My only experience here is as a domestic violence victim whose offender got away with it because of heavily similar reasons and because of it and my severe PTSD and betrayed familiar trust that part of the family has been entirely cut off. As a victim, you standing up for your fiancé’s sister stands quite tall to both of them no matter what your uncle decides should you tell him because it’s attest to going forward with your soon to be permanent family in the best type of way I can think of. I wish you well in this stressful ordeal.
What family connection? Nephew’s fiancé’s sister is not a family connection. Conflicts of interest arise in dual representation of two clients, representing a person opposing the client, or other things like that and none of them have to do with family this attenuated (immediate family only). Husbands and wives can be on opposite sides of litigation with informed consent from the clients. Further, true and blatant conflicts can be waived by clients even if they exist, which here, they dont.
