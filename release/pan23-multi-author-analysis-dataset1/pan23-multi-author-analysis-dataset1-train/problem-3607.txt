Thanks for the detailed and informative reply. The fact that the Auto was a very public and official event is interesting, up until recently I had thought they were rag-tag episodes of popular justice. Can you suggest any good books on the Spanish Inquisition in English? Cheers.
The preparation of the auto took a really long time, and because of that, it was a rather exceptional ocurrence, think of the logistics as something akin to a concert, but with fewer and worse means: the sambenitos, processional robes that the sentenced people wore to the gallows, needed to be made for each individual, and they were rather complex in design. These sambenitos were not burnt along the heretics, but hung in the parish to which the heretic had been ascribed, so everyone would be able to see them in the years to come, and the families of the heretics were publicly known, as they were barred from holding public office (see the Statutes of Blood Cleanliness by Cardinal Sil√≠ceo). The gallows had to be built ad hoc in the main square or in the close vicinity of the parish, as well as the stands for the audience. This requires some preparation and a lot of carpentry. In case one of the heretics had fled or died prior to the auto de fe, effigies (banners) had to be made so they would be executed in effigy.
As far as I have read, autos de fe always involved burnings, be it in effigy or in person. It was monstruously costly, and only happened for really big occasions like entire lutheran groups being busted.
