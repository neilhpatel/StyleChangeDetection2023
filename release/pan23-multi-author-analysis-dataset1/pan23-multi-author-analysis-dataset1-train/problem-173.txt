Oh look, another bad take. It's nothing to do with conversation rate. I'm not even sure what point you're trying to make here, 18k is about the minimum wage in the UK. So its still not the same as what you get in Sydney.
a lot of European countries have an aging population, and a low birth rate if I remember well italy has the biggest problem on that one and of course japan and unless you raises taxes even further pension will be in a deficit sooner than later (more money taken out than brought in) also the way money has been invested is important see singapore/norway pension fund.
So not really. That's the minimum age to start getting your "pension". The french system is different from say the US. You have to work 172 trimester to get your full "pension" so 43 year. You need to have started working at 19 to get your full pension at 62.
No, you're misunderstanding. 20k salary is shit. 20k as a pension, is good. You generally have much reduced costs of living (house traditionally paid off) alongside other benefits (free prescriptions, free bus travel).
