2) This is 35 years after Congreve first invented his version, which were very common, employed during the Napoleonic Wars, besides in India etc. In single engagements, ships would let off thousands of them like at Boulogne. So it was far from "experimental".
The first surviving depictions of the rockets, in the form of an arrow attached to a small tube containing gunpowder that could have worked as a reaction engine come from the Wǔ jīng zǒng yào (武經總要) written in mid-11th century by Zheng Gongliang, although it is also argued that this projectile was a simple arrow with a firecracker acting as an additional incendiary, explosive or sonic device. Nevertheless, in the military treatise Huǒ Lóng Jīng first published in late 1390s includes depictions of shén huǒ jiàn pái (神火箭 牌), or a ground battery for the arrows propelled by a rocket engine, arguably the precursor of the singijeon rockets and hwacha battery common in late 15th century Korea (the name of the latter seems to be borrowed directly from the Chinese huǒ chē, lit. 'fire cart'). What is interesting, that the artillery manual Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima written by a Polish artillery officer Kazimierz Siemienowicz and published in 1650 in Netherlands, although focusing on the classical artillery, includes many concepts related to rocketry, and , that won't be introduced until 20th century. The rocket became widespread, if still not popular in European and American armies throughout the 19th century, especially after the adoption of the steel-body rockets by British who first met such weapon in Mysore ruled by an already mentioned Tipu Sultan (the idea of using iron-cased rockets is attributed to his father, Hyder Ali Khan).
Thank you for your clarification. It is hard to imagine that an unguided rocket would be more effective than artillery.. It seems that I had wrongly (/s) thought that rocket tech was novel to the 20th century or it was developed in 20 years lol.
