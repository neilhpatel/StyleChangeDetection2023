Realistically, as the number of legally eligible smokers shrinks, tobacco will be harder and harder to find. By that point you would definitely need to import it.
It’s crazy how people will recognize prohibition for alcohol didn’t work and created an illicit a lucrative black market for criminals, prohibition of marijuana didn’t work and created a lucrative black market for criminals, but still somehow think it will work for tobacco.
I see. I guess I'm betting that that won't happen to an appreciable degree, because tobacco prohibition won't be 1:1 comparable with drug prohibition. We'll have to see!
Yeah, approximately 15% of lifetime smokers actually develop cancer. This is one of the reasons why the tobacco industry was able to fight off the accusations for so long. Just because you smoke all of your life doesn't necessarily mean you will die of lung cancer.
Yeah, I believe more than twenty percent of lung cancer cases are completely unrelated to smoking at all. Vehicle exhaust emissions and dust irritation are also potential causes that almost everyone is exposed to.
