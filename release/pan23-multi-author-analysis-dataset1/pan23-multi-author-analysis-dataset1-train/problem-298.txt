How is this going to be impacted by the 21st century Cures Act? I'm under the impression that psychotherapy notes are going to be available to clients with this new act. (Side note: I'm still waiting for clearer guidance from my hospital system about exactly what the clients have access to.).
Hi there I know you're being helpful in linking this, but the site you linked is a private entity that provides training modules for the profession, and we don't allow links to commercial sites like that as it can be seen as a recommendation or endorsement of their product or services. Can you please edit your post and paraphrase the content about exemptions instead? Thanks.
With respect to ePHI and the Final Rule, all of the data elements listed under the USCDI is now required to be shared (within a certain timeframe, and with certain exceptions—detailed below), upon request. This includes progress notes, but not psychotherapy notes. Psychotherapy notes should be stored separately (electronically in a designated "psychotherapy notes" section of EHR and/or physically) from the rest of the medical record.
No worries at all. The edit is fine and I reapproved it. We just get itchy about commercial blogs since they exist to advertise, even if informational. Thanks again!
Mental health practitioners have an exemption for HIPAA records for “psychotherapy notes” which is typically taken to mean the direct notes about a session - e.g, “patient has difficulty dealing with mother in law due to their own childhood fears”. Medical records are something else.
