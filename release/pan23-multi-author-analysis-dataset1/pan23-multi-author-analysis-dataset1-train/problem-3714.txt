I’m not so sure. NPR and others have done a lot of digging in Russia and their assessment is that about 80% of the Russian public identify as very pro-Putin. We think that he simply rigs the elections like any good dictator would. But if he ran, even now, with Ukraine raging and thousands of sons dying, in a truly fair, observed election he’d still win by an astonishing margin.

This man was a raging murderous lunatic - probably schizophrenic - under any normal circumstances genuinely certifiably insane.
It never changed. It told you it changed. Communists going to gaslight. Somehow we believed that Russia wasn’t communist even though it was being run like one from a ex KGB member.
Why can’t I call Russia communist when the entire elite and oligarch class is from the communist Soviet Union? They employ the same methods the same controls and the captured land in Ukraine they errecting statues of Lenin and Stalin. It would be easier to call Russia communist and republicans communists for supporting them. The only difference is Russia now has thrown religion into the mix.
