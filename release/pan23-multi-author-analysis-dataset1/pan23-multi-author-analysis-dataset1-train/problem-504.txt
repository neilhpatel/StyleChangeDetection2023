The number of spears can range from 2 - 4 and javelins from 6 - 8 ... with also an item called "Horseman Javelins" being an option which is a bag of 12 throw-able javelins.
Edit: It seems that my arguments can largely be summed up as me not liking the negative assessments of the Bolsheviks so I think I should add that I personally donâ€™t consider the coup or the Bolsheviks as being something positive, my views are very similar to the above mentioned author assessments of the revolution, I am simply interested in reading about history in as unbiased and factual way as possible.

Second, the Caucusus countries are only included in particularly generous definitions of the Middle East even today, and even then Georgia (and therefore Lazica) is still often excluded even when Azerbaijan and Armenia are included.
One is a simple matter of sources. Although it is my understanding that Pipes did have access to and used Central Party archives for the last book, he didn't for the 1990 volume, and that one is mostly based off of secondary sources. Even to the extent that he had access for the 1993 volume, he would not have had access to as much documentation as later historians working in former Soviet archives, let alone deal with the historiography of the past quarter century of such research.
I'm a bit confused by your confusion. The Lazic war was fought over and in the region of Lazica. Lazica was the territory on the western side of the Caucasus on the Black Sea, roughly where modern Georgia is. In classical antiquity, that would have been Colchis (also roughly). The region was called Lazica by Procopius when the war actually happened. (See History of the Wars of Justinian).
