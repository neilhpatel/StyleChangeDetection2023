Then the 40's came and with it WWII. In 1939 DuPont introduced nylon stockings advertised as being lightweight, easy to wash, elastic, long lasting, and tough. However with the war came campaigns to donate nylon and silk stockings, nylon and silk were needed for soldiers parachutes and uniforms. Due to the lack of actual stockings, 'liquid' and 'paint' stockings(and their ads) came to be. 'Painted on' stockings however required shaved legs in order to have a smooth even finish that looks like silk. Liquid stockings weren't new though Elizabeth Arden's 'Velva Beauty Film' has multiple ads from the 30's. During wartime many tips for fake stockings included the use of eyeliner to make a seam for the stockings, I found various images pertaining to this but couldn't confirm the magazines they were from.
Thanks for your answer. Curious, though, what do we know about the practice before 1915 ? Any more details about ancient Egypt, Rome, India? And what about the millennia from then until the early 20th century?
