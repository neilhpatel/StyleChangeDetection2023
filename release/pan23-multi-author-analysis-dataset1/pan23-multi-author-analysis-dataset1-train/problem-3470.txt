The west is basically saying there's a time limit on resources and against the chinese war machine. It's in the best interest for ukraine to take as much ground as they can because they need it to wrap up. That's what i gather from the article.
I am not advocating for Ukraine to give up territory, I am not advocating to let Russia get away with everything they want, what I am saying is if at any point the Ukrainian people ( not the politicians ) feel that they have suffered enough and that they rather want peace than to retake some land the it is important to not let political goals stand in the way of saving human lives.
The Ukrainian government also has a responsibility to preserve the lives of their own people, as long as they do and as long as the people fighting to do out of free will rather than a political agenda I have no issue with their continued fight, neither did anyone in the article, rly.
I understand that defeating Russia is important, I understand that the Ukrainian government does not want to yield an inch of their own country but every inch they retake is paid for with the lives of their own countrymen, so I guess the question is: How many lives are you willing to sacrifice for the cause before enough is enough?
Keep all the sanctions. If Russia really is a dead man walking over the next few years, why send more young men to die for a few more miles of shitty ex-Soviet rust belt?
