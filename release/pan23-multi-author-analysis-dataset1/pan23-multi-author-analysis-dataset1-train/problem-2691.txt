Ironically, in previous eras being poor was precisely the reason you had more kids. More offspring meant more household income eventually and a higher standard of living in your old age from having more kids to take care of you. Now we just warehouse old people in homes, and/or expect the gov't to take care of them. But neither of those options come cheap.
The older boomer liberals have fought hard culture wars for racial equality, just look at all the court cases that struck down laws that enabled race segregation and discrimination in America, which is why we have anti-discrimination laws as part of the status quo right now. The older liberals never did transform into the old racist conservatives of the 60's, instead they became conservative to the status quo racial equality we have today and have accepted it as good enough because they managed to get a nice racial equality benchmark (a black american president) within their lifetime.
My cousin is a Canadian who lives in Japan. He speaks Japanese. He married a Japanese woman, and they have several great kids. Any time he needs to engage with the Japanese government on anything —filing his taxes, renewing his driver's license— he gets some version of, "And here are the forms you'll need when you and your family move back to Canada.".
Basically capitalism demands it. In order for old people to retire (getting money for doing nothing) there needs to be young people working and paying for the old people.
