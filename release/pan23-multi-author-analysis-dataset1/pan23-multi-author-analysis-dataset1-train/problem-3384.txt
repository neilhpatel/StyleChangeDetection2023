Now that the bike rider is threatening legal action claiming your brother was involved in an accident, insurance will get involved. FYI the coverage that applies here is liability coverage not comprehensive, but if he had car insurance he had liability insurance because that is the legally required part.
Hi. Just wanted to respond to you. I had another multi vehicle claim. A woman in the rear of a morning freeway 5 car pileup was trying to make a claim for a braking foot injury. She was never involved in the collision, but rather stopped in time to avoid collision. She felt owed compensation for avoiding a collision by braking hard because her foot hurt now.
She said her foot wouldn't hurt if the insured hadn't caused a collision. Legally, she wasn't involved and was owed nothing. At some point, even the law and juries recognize that you're responsible for saving yourself if you can. What injuries might have been sustained had the cyclist impacted the vehicle? Who knows but flipping over handlebars is probably safer than smashing into a moving vehicle.
