Never understood the hate for calculus, math in general, physics or chemistry. Somehow I always understood that. Languages on the other hand.. shudders.
I’m literally an addiction psychologist. I know addiction is far more complicated than saying “it’s a choice” but it’s also not a part of the person. It is changeable. Being gay isn’t. No matter how much gay sex I don’t have, I’m still gay.
I'm guessing you've never studied actual moral philosophy at a credible academic institution. There are uncounted views on moral philosophy that allow for objective right and wrong, and only a small portion of them derive from the alleged opinions of a deity transmitted without error through scripture/dogma/whatever.
It is not that simple. I agree, this is a laughable position. Let me explain with some thoughts. Say you agree that driving cars 'hurts more ppl' than walking. Are you going to forgo your right to drive a car because it could hurt someone? And likely driving a car is factually more potentially harmful than walking. So I better see you walking everywhere... Obviously this isn't a position you live by. Another potential issue is self harm, do you let ppl jump off a building or do hard drugs? They harm themselves but not others, is that anyone?
1) self harm is harming someone, the person himself. So your rule isn't "don't harm anyone", it's "don't harm others". But fine, I'll drop this point.
