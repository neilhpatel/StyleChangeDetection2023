I say that as a Swede, we haven't sold weapons to anyone in conflict since Finland got invaded in ww2. Even then that's because we love the Finns. We've been neutral and at peace for 200 years.
Austria and Hungary (especially Hungary since they are actually in NATO) being jerks about supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion does damage the alliance and puts member states like the Baltics and Poland at significant risk of further Russian aggression.
There are times and there are times. ww2 proved that there's no such thing as true "neutrality" when there's a large nation doing imperialist invasions in Europe. There are times when things aren't clearcut, but this isn't one of those times.
Austria wanted to neutralize Serbia as a threat as the current Serbian government and military apparatus had murdered the pro-Austrian king a decade prior and was basically Russias protectorate.
And? Canada had a invasion plan of the US during the early 1900’s. So what? I’m sure the US also has contingency plans should any of its Allie’s turn their backs in them.
