Biden seems fine. Still goes bicycling. Still pretty sharp. I know someone older than him who is still sharp as a tack. Really cool guy, too.

Also Obama also expanded healthcare to 15 to 20 million people via the ACA Medicaid expansion, and to millions more via the subsidies, plus protected half the country via the preexisting conditions protections (around half the country has preexisting conditions) and also expanded subsidies for low income college students (via the 2010 reconciliation bill) and also expanded anti discrimination and equal pay legislation via Shepard Byrd and Lily Ledbetter.
Holy shit. It's like that's the only thing detractors can bring up, neglecting the fact that it still involved forcing the rail companies to agree to a deal that gave significant concessions to the unions.
Seriously though. No Democratic candidates have announced and the ones in the regressive side are nightmares. If it's a choice of them or default Biden, it's an easy choice. He's done better in the last 2 years than most anyone could have expected. Still could have done more but he is far from the worst choice at the moment.
