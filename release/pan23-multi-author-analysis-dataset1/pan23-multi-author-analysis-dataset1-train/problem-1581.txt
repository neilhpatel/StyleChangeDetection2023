Perhaps the nation that benefited the most, besides Egypt, was the United States. It had showed the world that the age of these imperialist powers were over and the age of the US had begun. The US was now the unrivaled leader of NATO. Without US involvement, a possible war would have broken out with the UK, France and the USSR, and honestly without America the Soviets would have won, and all parties involved knew that if western Europe wanted to stay capitalist and not a soviet puppet state, then they’d need American support to do so.
This is backwards. France left the integrated military command structure, but remained within NATO. As , "NATO LEFT PARIS, BUT FRANCE DID NOT LEAVE NATO".
tl;dr: France never left NATO. It left some subportions of NATO's command structure but remained a NATO member throughout.
France left the military command structure, and remained within NATO. France did not leave NATO. There's not really room for disagreement on that point. If you'd like to read more about French involvement in NATO, some information is contained in Beatrice Heuser's NATO, Britain, France, and the FRG around page 102-103, and Timothy Sayle's Enduring Alliance around page 119 (Chapter 6). Sayle in particular discusses valuable information about how France's decision shifted from nearly withdrawing fully from NATO to the lesser withdrawal from the military command, and also provides valuable insight into how the UK had been itself somewhat at odds with NATO until France's decision presented an opportunity to paint itself anew as the "good ally".
I have to disagree with you. While they did remain in the command structure, they were not involved in any major NATO operation and actually went against NATO members in notable conflicts such as the Nigerian civil war. Last time I checked, allies don’t formally back different sides in a civil war such as that. Not to mention French sale of weapons to groups that were in direct conflict with NATO members or allies.
