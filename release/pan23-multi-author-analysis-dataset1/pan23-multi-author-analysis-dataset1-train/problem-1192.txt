When the question is "can a religious school discriminate in employment or student privileges on the basis of sexual orientation" the answer is almost always yes.
IANAL. Religious schools in general, and Catholic schools in particular, have latitude to impose policies, restrictions and rules that conform to their religious teachings. Catholic schools have been legally allowed to fire teachers who are in same-sex relationships, or who were divorced and then remarried. There is nothing you, or your parents can do about this.
They can't provide educational services differently to students on the basis of their gender identity or sexual preference, but they can and do discriminate in extracurricular activity and other forms of school-related expression.

Catholic hospitals generally receive Medicare and Medicaid funding so they can't enforce anti-LGBTI policies against their clinical/administrative/ancillary staff, but could against chaplains. Receiving this funding does not require them to provide gynecological/obstetric or urological care that is against their teachings (often there is a carve out in the legislation addressing this specifically).
