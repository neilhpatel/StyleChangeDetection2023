Look up videos on YouTube about not talking to the cops. Idk why everyone thinks it's a good idea...oh wait the years and years of movies and tv shows praising cops as these bad ass do gooders.
Highlight the order numbers, address shipped to (particularly if an address other than your own), card number used for purchase, and dates on each invoice so it's easier to reference if you need to go back and look them up again, I'd also write the order dates and order numbers down on a separate sheet just for redundancy sake and so you can easily add notes beside each one.
Stop talking. Get an attorney. Anything more than a simple traffic ticket should involve an attorney. IANAL, it my mother, father and step father were cops. I am not one of those either. Lol.
Her mother saying that seems to indicate he's either uninvolved in the Amazon purchases or he intentionally made the purchases in hopes of framing the two of you and recouping the money from you or the bank (and maybe fencing the items as well). In either case, you should protect yourself by taking the steps I shared. If you find unauthorized purchases in the account history you should contact Amazon to inform them you didn't make the purchases and didn't receive the shipments, then ask if there's additional info they can provide, such as the devices used to make the purchases, the public IP addresses they were made from, and the timestamps for the logins preceding those purchases. Amazon may not provide that info to you, but if you are arrested, after you get an attorney your attorney can likely subpoena Amazon to request it. Be aware that it's possible that purchases were made from your devices and/or IP addresses tied to you in some way and that even if that's not the case those details may not eliminate you two as suspects. The police or district attorney may have already subpoenaed Amazon for the same info or may in the future.
