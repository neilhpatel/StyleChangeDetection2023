12(b)6 doesn’t mean the issues in the complaint are not in dispute. Technically it means that even if the facts in the complaint are true, there’s still no claim upon which relief can be granted. These are filed every time and rarely succeed.
In the mtd, OC lied about my position, misrepresented my promised salary, dates of my employment, and my hours worked, even though all were documented in the complaint by evidence that originated from my employer himself, pay stub, written employment offer, posted weekly schedules, text message offering the job with start date, etc. The court expects me to adhere to all these rules and procedures as if I were an attorney, but somehow I don't think it would be tolerated if I did the things the attorney does. It's hard to believe that all it takes to steal an employee's wages is an attorney to facilitate the process and engage the support of the court in doing so. Its difficult to contend with someone like that as an unrepresented plaintiff. This has been an eye-opening and disappointing experience for me to learn that the federal court system is broken to such extent that a person should have to work without being paid even a minimum wage.
