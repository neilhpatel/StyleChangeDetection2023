Exactly. The genius of Trumpism is its stupidity. It appeals exactly to the worst of the worst and stupidest of the stupidest type of personality. DeSantis is more in-tune with culture war bullshit (take, for example, his recent anti-LGBT and anti-intellectual education policies) while Trump is really only in-tune with himself. I see a significant portion of former Trump supporters rallying to DeSantis, but the True Believers (Jan. 6'ers, QAnon'ers, etc.) will not bend the knee to anyone but their Great Orange Idiot.
