In general, a lease is binding as soon as it's executed, even if you don't take possession until later on. They may be banking on you being willing to renegotiate, rather than taking the risk of being in the right and also homeless while you sue. That's, ah, rude, but not illegal, unfortunately.
I have a short list of other options though I would want to keep this unit or at least have a fair renegotiation for another unit in the building under the same price or less (for the hassle), I guess I'm just not sure how to approach those renegotiations -- do I outright tell them that they are unlawfully breaching the contract thus they need to remedy the situation by doing xyz otherwise I will look into legal action?
If you aren't willing to pay more, you don't have to. You have a contract. The landlord is in breach if they don't honor it. Remind them that you have a lease, and that you expect the unit to be ready on move-in day, and leave it at that: if they fucked up and rented the unit out to someone else, they need to solve that problem, rather than passing the buck back to you.
