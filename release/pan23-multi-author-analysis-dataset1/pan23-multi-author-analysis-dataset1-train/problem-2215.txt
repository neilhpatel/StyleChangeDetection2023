Yeah let’s ban something that 2 percent of the country used in 2020. I’m sure they’ll just stop using it entirely and it won’t fuel the black market further. Nah.
Especially if that was the only substance involved the only way I can see that happening is freak misuse/accident, weird contamination or using industrial grade (not culinary/medical grade) or they literally refused to breathe for an extremely large amount of time which is absurdly stupid and would require actual effort to achieve.
Oh well, we live in a society. Alcohol won't get banned, cops will come home and get drunk before domestically abusing their wives, and people will normalize alcohol abuse while treating weed like Satan himself. Oh well.
Unlike other inhalants, nos is not inherently neurotoxic and it's euphoric/psychoactive effects, while not fully understood, are a lot closer to that of other dissociatives like arylcyclohexylamines rather than air duster or chrome spraypaint or whatever.
True. As someone who has tried a variety of substances, alcohol is still one of the easiest to access, abuse, and cause serious damage to oneself and the people around them. It's actually absurd.
