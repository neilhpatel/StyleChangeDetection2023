Just frustrating to me that the governments solution to a “labour crisis” is importing cheap labour rather than actually addressing root causes.
Regular immigration isn’t my issue, it’s the governments policy of bringing in tons on Temporary Foreign Workers to work low paying jobs. The standards for TFWs are much much lower than the standards for proper immigration. I probably should’ve focused on that a bit more in my posts, but I thought the first 2 conveyed that well enough. Importing cheap labour en masse absolutely does suppress wages.
Eh. I know we are sick of hearing about it and obviously it has been used as an excuse to price-gouge people but there are actual real supply issues. The "full picture" should take that into account as well.
of foreign workers as it’s hurting the economic opportunities of people already in Canada: FN, immigrants, descendants of imperialists alike. If we had the infrastructure, economy, and healthcare systems to support that many people, I would have nothing to say, but that’s not the case.
