I didnt say we got dumber. But alone 20th century was literally the golden age for science. It had 14 of the elements found on the periodic table, electricity, cars, quantum mechanics, plastics, airplanes, rockets, genetics, antibiotics, etc.. 1922 alone we found a pharohs tomb, set properties for genetic heredity, successful insulin treatment, and Bohr got his noble peace price. (There also is a lot of sketchy Germany science that I will not get into) On top of that, we had the money to do that even after the great depression.

Seriously. Major construction everywhere you look, and yet you still have dopes claiming she's not following through on her promise to fix them. Like, what do you expect? Her to snap her fingers and they're fixed? You actually have to have road crews out to do the work, which they're doing, and yeah it's annoying, but it needs to be done.
