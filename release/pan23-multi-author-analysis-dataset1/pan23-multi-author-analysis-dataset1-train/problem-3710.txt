In a largely low-key address devoid of forecasts of imminent success, Putin sought to deflect blame for what he called the “shared tragedy” of the war that he began, repeating claims that the conflict was unavoidable even as Ukraine and its US and European allies had repeatedly made clear before the invasion that there was no threat to Russia’s security.
Dude. That cachethic old man shits his pants regularly due to bowel cancer, and his limbs are constantly trembling because of parkinsonism. His face is all puffed up due to steroidal treatment and he can barely string a coherent sentence when trying to speak without assistance. Proving that he can climb a flight of stairs by himself would be enough of an achievement already.
Exactly. A persistent and stubborn insurgency that actually killed Americans on a regular basis, and still the US just paid whatever it cost for over a decade. Not quite in Ukraine. Few if any US casualties. Maybe it'll wind up costing the same over ten years, but I'm hopeful the US would just pay it. Throw in the fact that Russia cannot make it for ten years and a favorable result almost seems inevitable.
