Spielberg's (1977) appears to have taken cues from the Hills' experience, depicting the aliens in a similar form and number. Ten years later, Whitley Strieber's story of alien abduction, the international bestseller "Communion", prominently featured a classic 'grey' on the cover. Underground artist Bill Barker's 'Schwa' alien head symbol became popular for a period in the early 1990s, and Greys appeared in shows like the X-Files in the mid-to-late 1990s, serving to cement them further as the depiction of extraterrestrial beings.
Beautiful answer, thank you! Being encased in Western culture, I haven't heard much about the "exotic" aliens you referred to. What are some examples of their physical descriptions and what kind of interactions, if any, have they had with those who claim to have encountered them? Are they also portrayed as morally ambiguous? Harmful? Helpful? Thank you.
Regarding your comment about Gnomes: I am Peruvian, and I always saw Gnomes as cryptids/supernatural creatures to scare off little kids (and particularly annoying ones to me, because they were mostly portrayed like silly looking European garden gnomes... No apparent Precolumbian influences there!).
