Don't get me wrong, I don't mind it at all and think it's great they've found shelter here, but it's a vast change from what things were like before, it's still a bit of a shock. It makes the war so... real here. So many people care about this, so many people have families there. Also all world leaders, all humanitarian support, all the military aid, tanks, everything, it all goes through Poland. Within a year we went from a quiet place to one of the world's most important locations with so much stuff happening all at once. Proud we stepped up to really manage this. Also glad of the vast infrastructure we have built up over the last two decades which really makes this possible. And finally, except for some obvious nutjobs which exist in every country, we are all so glad we can help our neighbors, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, send a big, hearty fuck you to Russia after centuries of oppression.
Probably. But the POTUS is probably the safest object inside Ukraine right now, even without the military. No one wants that smoke.
Exactly. POTUS feeling comfy enough to go into a war zone is a monumental "pffft. We've seen the reports, you guys are fucked." To Putin. Pretty bold move.
