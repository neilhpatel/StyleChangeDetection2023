One more reason, other than education, is that students are more idealistic (care more about the far future than immediate needs) and have less burden (such as a family to support).
Education is naturally opposed to authoritarianism. Free thought and open discourse has lead to revolutionary tendencies since the enlightenment. Itâ€™s telling when historical dictatorships often focused on purging the local intelligentsia; the educated are the largest civilian threat to consolidating authoritarian rule.
Why are you so upset? What is your stance exactly ?. Did me saying fuck all ruling parties upset you? Did me criticizing the British Goverment for doing the same thing months ago hurt you? That's not even remotely related to what the person said I responded to where you wanted to jump in with some non point and drag it out talking nonsense like a politician would. Then come with a full non comparison to the statement which is now deleted by op. His intentions were clear and when called out they ran. Like you should. There's boots to be polished.
Once China has achieved full technological control over their citizens, being able to track and incentivise them exactly as they want, they could unleash another pandemic for which West has even more trouble handling, but thanks to their citizens having no privacy and ways of immediately controlling them China could come out on top.
. I figured you must be a loyalist or at least a fearful Bourgeois. I can say those things. I did. Still am. Also it wasnt the monarchy that arrested people. It was the blue nonce following orders blindly and aggressively. This is a danger for all people. You keep using words like british empire and monarchy to make it seem like the current goverment is not corrupt to the core.
