A modern example of this would be around the Iberian Wolf in Spain, which only began to have some protections against hunting some 40 years ago. Many Spanish farmers strongly oppose those protections, and see the wolves as threats to livestock. And while certain wolf populations do attack livestock occasionally, some studies have found that significantly more livestock deaths are caused by feral dogs...which invariably get blamed on wolves (whether from prejudice, or in an attempt to claim compensation from the authorities, or both, I leave to the reader to decide).
Yes. People would let their pigs free during the days to find their food elsewhere and, presumably, not tear up their shed/barn/yard by rooting. And yes, sometimes the pigs would snout their way into unlocked homes, and sometimes a pig would either eat, or try to, an unwatched infant. This wasn't exactly an everyday event, but it happened enough to leave traces in court records and to be considered one motivation for laws like 15C Nuremberg's against letting your pigs roam free.
