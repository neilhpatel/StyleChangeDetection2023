Their whole policy has been crazy. I can sort of fathom strict quarantines before vaccinations were available, but they’ve doubled down on them plus half-baked vaccines. It’s like they’re trying to make problems for everyone.
My understanding early on was that the fundamental change to a mRNA based vaccine was that it had the ability to change with the disease thereby making the efficacy higher, But maybe that was just one of the early media pieces that wasn’t fully vetted before they wrote about it, or maybe I just misunderstood.
Yes. When you have 2 billion people and no effective vaccine to stop the spread / prime immune systems to limit the extent of the systemic infection of each person, you then have 2 billion prime Petri dishes — and trillions upon trillions of mutation opportunities.
What am I missing? Why is a polio vaccine effective enough to full stop polio but a Covid vaccine is not?
I think it is fair to say that a vaccine isn’t a vaccine if you can still get Covid. At that point it’s just a treatment.
Wonder if they are hoping to spread it to the west in hopes of dividing and destabilizing, weaponizing a pandemic is 100% something I could see China doing, especially after their thinly veiled attempt at total domestic control with their "zero covid policy" failed.
They likely want it to spread to the west, they openly treat the west as their enemy and since their zero covid policy was a disaster that blew up in their faces spreading the new variant to their enemies to further divide and destabilize would give them the opportunity to scape goat the new strain on the west and claim it started with the west... again, like they did with the first round.
