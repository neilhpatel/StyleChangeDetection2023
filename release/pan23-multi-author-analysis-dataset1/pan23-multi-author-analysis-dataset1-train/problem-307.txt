Would the same be true for the time that he was only bound by the terms of his no-contact injunction, before i filed for the pfa? Its really hard for me to follow the status of his assault charges because the only way I can view the hearings are through the judges youtube channel, but they never end up posting the stream. When i call the court clerk her only answer has been “I don’t know what to tell you”…. I received a single page outlining the conditions of his bond, which simply said “no contacting the victims” and no possession of firearms or other weapons. Nothing very specific.

The attorney, or person acting on such attorney’s behalf, shall be identified in any such contact.
