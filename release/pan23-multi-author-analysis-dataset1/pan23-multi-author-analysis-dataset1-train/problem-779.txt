He was kind of a lay about and not a great student, but not really in an unusual way. He was just somewhat intellectually lazy. Much preferred bumming tickets to go to the opera over buckling down over his studies. This is a big reason for his failure as both an artist and a prospective architectural student. While he wasn't completely w/out talent, (his postcards aren't bad), he lacked the natural talent in art or architecture that might have made up for his generally lackadaisical work ethic. A style that he displayed as dictator of Germany. He kept a rather bohemian schedule in which he slept in late, screwed around most of the day, got to work in the afternoon and worked into the late evening, then repeated. Often described as a procrastinator.
Great post. About Hitler's time in the army: you mention that it was one of the best times of his life. Was that considered a bit odd? I mean I can see why some would like the camaraderie, but wouldn't that be outweighed by being on the fing Western Front?!
For instance there at times has been a myth that Hitler was extremely poor after WW I and before his rise to power, but Kershaw states that while Hitler did live in a men's home from time to time after the war, he was also sent fairly regular sums of money from his doting mother, who he often pestered for more cash. He hailed from a slightly upper middle class family background. He didn't come from da streets. .
"Assigning the actions of the thousands of perpetrators of the Holocaust to Hitler or mental pathology, we refuse to engage with them as historical actors whose actions can be analyzed and thus render the whole idea of historians trying to learn something about Nazism and the Holocaust as moot ".
