I die laughing every time people on right wing AM radio make a specific effort to refer to it as 'the free state of Florida' and it's like they can't read the books they want, they can't take the classes they want, they can't buy legal marijuana as medicine if they want, they can't exercise bodily autonomy if they want, etc.
Maybe the DOJ for human trafficking? But if you’re an elected official you can do whatever you want in the USA. It’s worth running for office for pure immunity in America. /s.
Now the general Floridian can accept the POS they are since they take gratification to the point of creating a line item on their state budget to send poor individuals to areas using their understandable naivete against them, often when the weather is detrimental to their lives. It's a fucking great thing the people of the area's these poor individuals are being sent to have the ounce of humanity the average Floridian lacks.
