This is an interesting question that got a thorough investigation in the early 1980s, during the infamous Hitler Diaries fiasco. The German news magazine Stern, which had uncovered the – as things turned out, clumsily forged – diaries, was very concerned that the monumental scoop it thought it had on its hands might be disrupted by some distant heir of Hitler's, of whose existence it was unaware, coming forward to claim copyright over these materials. So it went to some effort to trace and negotiate with any likely claimants in advance.
