You have your mandatory Lithuanian classes, followed with mandatory English classes. At (I believe, been a while) 6th grade (12-13 y.o.) you are supposed to pick up a 3rd language. It is mostly a toss-up between Russian and German or if your school is posh enough, French followed up with really rarely Spanish.
"Typically offered?" Nearly every school I've seen usually offers French or Spanish. And then maybe a third language if your school is really nice/endowed.
Edit: fucking autocorrect turned experience into experieNYC... I believe i have figured out how to butcher english.
What people also don't realise is than in Russian and Polish language schools (where you study in Russia/Polish but use Lithuanian education program - for the uninitiated), you essentially learn that foreign language as a third, as both Lithuanian and Russian/Polish are then considered mother tongue and are mandatory.
Yup. They are surrounded on all sides. If they allowed English to gain a foothold, they wouldn't still be speaking French.
