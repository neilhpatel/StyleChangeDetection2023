The article claims that North Carolina has a bigger gun problem than Illinois and uses the metric of "age-adjusted gun death rate". Of course the average reader is going to use that to say that there are more murders by firearm in North Carolina than Illinois, when in fact that is not the case when you look at the total number of firearm homicides in each state and compare that to their populations. North Carolina has a lot more suicides by gun than Illinois does, but doesn't have more homicides.
Yes, but it doesn't mean that the average person needs to be worried about gun death rates as opposed to gun homicide rates. For the non-suicidal person, gun death rate is not at all relevant compared to metrics better suited for illustrating risk of being a victim of violent crime.
Yeah. Because the majority of our country lives in urban centers or the outlying suburbs. The idea that ‘America’ is small town USA is just ridiculous. The vast amount of wealth in the country is made in the blue areas. It’s insane to believe the majority of this country is republican.
