The Mexica Empire is famous (or perhaps infamous) for their sweeping conquest, and while there is some truth to that, diplomacy also played a major role. The nobles of Aztec city-states were divided into groups known as Teccalli/Tecaltin plural (Noble House) which competed with each other for political power in their own state and over their neighbours. One way of augmenting their power was to ally with Teccaltin from more powerful factions. In Central Mexico, this meant allying with the Mexica. Some city-states joined the Empire willingly because being friendly with the Mexica not only protected them from attack, it also allowed them access to exotic goods flowing in from the Mexica's tributary and trade networks. Cholula is an excellent example of this. This system was cheap and effective, and required little oversight from the Mexica. However, it relied heavily on their ability to form, often personal, connections between a huge number of squabbling political factions.
