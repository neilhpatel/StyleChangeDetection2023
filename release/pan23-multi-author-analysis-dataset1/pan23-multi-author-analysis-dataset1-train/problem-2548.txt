There is a major difference though. The vast majority of Iranians are against their fascist regime while Putin enjoys overwhelming support in Russia. He's revered by nearly every single Russian.
That's quite the oversimplification. Russia's puppet was ousted because he didn't represent Ukrainians, as soon as he went back on his promise of EU integration. And he had already lost once before that.
Uh, that's also a myth, Navalny and his associates have defended Ukraine's right to Crimea and Donbass, for example, and want good relations with the West, but tried for years to not run afoul of Russia's laws that question its "territorial integrity", including of Russia's annexed territories. Russia would naturally acquire a stronger natural "sphere of influence" around itself akin to the one US has with Canada and Mexico solely because of its size and economic growth, but its worst impulses would always be constrained through the presence of democratic checks and balances, and would be of a very different nature to the relations current Putin's Russia has.
