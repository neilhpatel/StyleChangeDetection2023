It's very bad. To address some points of the argument, mostly focusing on the bits about ancient cults and Eleusinian initiation:
But it is reasonable to point out that he talks about other ancient cult sites too, and that in some cases there is a feasible case to be made. He does talk about ergot found at a 2nd century BCE indigenous settlement in Catalonia, and THC found at 8th century BCE Tel Arad in Israel: so in the cases of those two cult sites, yes there is actual evidence: at Tel Arad the evidence seems clear that there was intentional use of THC, but very doubtful in the Catalonian case (I find it implausible for reasons I stated above: because ergot occurs naturally and so doesn't in itself indicate intent, and because ergot can have very undesirable effects).
Thanks for replying. Many books about drugs in antiquity are hampered by inadequate discussion of what counts as evidence for drugs. What would you say counts as "good evidence"?
Muraresku's parallels for mind-altering mixtures at ancient cult sites are in Catalonia and Israel, not anywhere in the Greek world; they don't involve Greek divinities; they have nothing to do with the cult of Demeter, Kore, or Hades; there's no evidence to suggest that the presence of potentially mind-altering substances was intentional (ergotised barley occurs naturally, and juniper use doesn't normally have anything to do with getting high); they're explicitly alcoholic mixtures, and the kykeon at Eleusis is explicitly non-alcoholic; and we have no documentary evidence of any kind for any use of mind-altering substances, in any Greek cult, except alcohol.
Seems like hyperbole to me. Are you suggesting that Muraresku is solely only exclusively based on Ker√©nyi's phrase?
