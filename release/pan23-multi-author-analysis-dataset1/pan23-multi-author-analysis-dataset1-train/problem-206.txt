Isolationist policy isn’t uniquely incompatible with global influence. Isolationist policy is generally more about not getting tangled up in foreign wars and political issues, but that can be separate from a global influence on culture and economy.
Well it is. China will likely exceed USA gdp in the next decade. They look to want to exceed USA militarily. They pretty much have us all addicted to cheap labour providing cheap products - a practice that has hollowed out manufacturing and associated middle class wages in the west.
Of course it is. After Trump demonstrated that the word of the US can be counted on only until the next presidential election, he threw a grenade into US global influence. If US can’t be counted on to keep any promises made, why would people be willing to enter deals with us anymore. Trump did a shit ton of damage in the 4 years he was president. Blowing up the Iran deal is high on that list.
