I'm not exaggerating here. The 20 million figure derives almost entirely from a series of best-guess estimates made at the time, and the reason we tend to think of that 20 million figure is because our first exposure to the Taiping tends to be clickbaity articles that only talk about that death toll and maybe also 'hurr durr Jesus' brother look how dumb Chinese people were'. In reality, our hard data is incredibly limited. The last national census around 1851 gave a figure of a little over 450 million people. Around 1911, the figure was just under that. While it is striking that the Qing Empire should have seen basically zero net population growth across this 60-year period, the interim is just not known. 20-30 million exists as a reasonable estimate, not a hard number. To be frank, it is nearly impossible to work out the precise demographic impact of the Taiping when there were also other major demographic catastrophes like floods on the Yellow River, or the Panthay and Dungan Revolts, which devastated Yunnan, Shaanxi and Gansu, where we do have slightly better provincial population records.
Thanks! I've been reading a little into the Heavenly Kingdom recently and your questions answered page seems like it'll be super useful.
Oh, absolutely. The Taiping were at one stage considered the antecedent to both the Republican and Communist revolutions and so their study was heavily politicised. More recently there's been a bit of uncertainty about what exactly to make of it. The 2000 Taiping miniseries is somewhat ambivalent about the Taiping on the whole, though as of 2012 there was an attempt made by Taiping scholars to latch onto Hong Rengan's 'modernising' agenda. From the Euro-American side of things of course, politics doesn't enter quite as strongly.
