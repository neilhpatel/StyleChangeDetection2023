Unless your son's coach broke a specific promise to you -- if they explicitly promised not to practice against slightly older children, for instance -- it's hard to argue that he should not have practiced against a 14 year old. Yes, children grow a lot between 12 and 14, but there's also a lot of variation between children in when they start their growth spurt, how fast they grow during it, and how big they get before it's over, so a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old aren't necessarily (very) different sizes. Some twelve-year-olds start their growth spurt early. Some fourteen-year-olds haven't started theirs yet. School teams of different ages practice successfully with no injuries all the time; but football inherently carries a risk of injuries, and there's nothing here that says that this injury was directly caused simply by having children of different ages on the field, nor that he wouldn't have broken a bone if they'd been scrimmaging against a group of similarly aged children.
