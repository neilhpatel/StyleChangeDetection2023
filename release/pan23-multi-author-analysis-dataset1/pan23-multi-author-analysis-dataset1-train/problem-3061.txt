You are right to be confused! "Myths" are known from documents dating to ancient times. The authors of these documents were inspired by various things and drew from diverse backgrounds - both temporally and geographically. These authors drew inspiration from oral traditions and beliefs, but they had diverse motivations for producing records of these narratives (and what they reflected about contemporary tradition).
Here, from the point of view of a folklorist, I will provide some background for an understanding of what was likely occurring in folk culture to inspire these documents.
This is the context with which we must view all attempts to document folk traditions - whether it is Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Celtic, Norse, or even when it comes to the lives of some of the Christian saints. With these exception of the last of these (which often followed a different trajectory) these stories and traditions percolated among the folk for countless generations, resulting in a tangle that was at once cohesive and contradictory.
Thanks, thatâ€™s a great primer! Can you point me to anything about the specific histories of eg Selene/Artemis and their development?
Definitions are always problematic. Greek myths include several types of legends - etiological (explanations of the origin of things) and historical (referring to a past in more or less realistic terms, but nevertheless mutated by oral tradition). There are also documents that describe what would be later considered folktales, but the intent in ancient Greek folk culture is unknowable. Here are definitions I presented to my students when teaching folklore; it is an excerpt from my , which I used in my classes:
Myths are not folklore; rather, they draw from and were inspired by contemporary folklore, but they are an imperfect step removed. For definitions, see the thread attached to this one.
