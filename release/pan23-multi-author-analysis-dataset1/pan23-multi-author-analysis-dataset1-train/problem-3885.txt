This is a case that I often remember when dealing with genetically modified products The issue is not whether or not they are better crops, the issue is the intellectual property that these large companies hold. Monsanto suing a small farmer for using genetically modified canola crops, went through the years and years of litigation before landing in the Canadian Supreme Court. Although Schmeizer was eventually found guilty of using the Monsanto crops by 5 to 4 margin, any monetary damage by Monsanto was nullified. Schmeiser maintained the whole time that he never used, purchased, or bought genetically modified seeds from Monsanto, and that the crops obtained the genetic traits strictly due to pollen from adjacent fields of other farmers.
terrible analogy. picking up those 10k? you do that on purpose. random crop from nearby fields in your own harvest is not a choice. it can happen even if i don't want it. thats why people are outraged.

Why? Crops are engineered just like anything else. do you also find it abysmal that we allow cars to be copyright? Or anything else...
“Intentionally concentrates” this is a ridiculous argument. Farmers do that with their own plants all the time. Anytime you find a favorable trait you obviously will select for that for future generations. Farmers not going to ignore the planting a more prolific crop is gonna be beneficial in the next generation. So obviously they will select and concentrate those crops.
