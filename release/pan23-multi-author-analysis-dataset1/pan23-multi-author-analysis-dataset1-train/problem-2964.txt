This is not just an emphatic yes from me, but from Herodotus. Herodotus only rarely has any direct insight to events beyond the Greek speaking world, but he was relatively knowledgeable about events that occurred in or immediately nearby the entire Greek sphere, including the Greek cities of Anatolia in Persian territory. He seems to indicate that the Persian forces marshaled in two location in Anatolia before crossing into Europe.
I mentioned two mustering points in Anatolia above, but the eastern army that started its march in Capadoccia also broke for winter quarters in the winter of 481-480 and dispersed across western Anatolia. Herodotus says that it took seven days for the whole army to cross the bridges over the Hellespont. Once again, this is something that some suggest as an example of Herodotus exaggerating the size of the army, but from a logistical perspective it would make sense to divide the army into separate sections and march them into Europe in separate waves.
1. 100k troops out of 1M persians = 10% of the entire (male) population? That seems like a very large percentage, and a very small overall population.
Alexander I is complicated figure with complicated motivations, but one popular theory among historians is that Alexander framed his advice as goodwill toward the Greeks, but desperately needed to get the Persian army moving out of his own territory because they placed too much burden on Macedonian resources. The Greeks withdrew and the Persians advanced.
