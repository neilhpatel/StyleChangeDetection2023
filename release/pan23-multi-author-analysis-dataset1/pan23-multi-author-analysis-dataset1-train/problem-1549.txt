Yes, the early successes may have largely been helped by rumors that US intelligence was able to surmise basically the entire plan of the early Kiev Offensive, allowing Ukraine to adjust and prepare anti-air defenses, which stopped the VDVâ€™s raid from being able to adequately secure a flight path for reinforcing infantry at Hostomel.
"nearly" dosen't count. He HAS lost 100k soldiers, and thousands of tanks, artillery, and has shown Russia to be a weak corrupt little dictatorship. He HAS given the west a great gift.
It was never close: Russia didn't have the mobilized manpower needed to hold territory, its soldiers didn't have the training or equipment to overcome obstacles, and the idea that the Ukrainians would just surrender because the Russians reached Kiev is asinine.
Infographics has an excellent about this. Russia's plan was to drop thousands of troops at Kyiv's airport use then in combination with the convoy outside Kyiv to seige the city. This might have been something Ukraine couldn't have come back from.
