Social Security and Medicare are INSURANCE POLICIES that we pay for. Not "hand outs". The reason that those laws were passed in the first place is because so many of those wonderful "free market" private insurers made bad investments at best and lost their shirts or took the money and ran at worst, leaving seniors, disabled persons and the others who PAID INTO THEIR POLICIES without resources. The idea of government oversight in these programs is so dishonest and greedy people DON'T abscond with the money. Now Republicans have decided that THEY want to play the role of the greedy, irresponsible thieves and either privatize the programs, leaving them open to abuse or to just take all of the money that WE HAVE PAID INTO THE SYSTEM....OUR MONEY, and distribute it to those who need it least: the wealthy. Is all of this being clear to you? NOT handouts. OUR money. OUR insurance and retirement policies. NOT "entitlements".
EU goods would have no tariffs. US goods some tariffs over health care, labor rights and laxer environmental rules, Central American narco regimes making US underwear would have higher tariffs. Something like that. No need to be Coy.
