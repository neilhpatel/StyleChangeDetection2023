Why build any settlements? No special justification is needed. Nevermind that a lot of the "Settlers" just returned to their property after Jordan's ethnic cleansing, some before the idea that these territories obviously belong to Palestinians was adopted as the latest excuse to tell us where not to be.
Oh? And where had their families been living for the past 3 millennia or so? For the majority of them, right where Israel currently is. It isn't like the whole of the region was deserted between the beginning of the Diaspora and the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. Or, for that matter, that all of the people living there at the time of the Diaspora actually left. There were still a large number of Jews in the area who didn't leave. Shoot, for a time they controlled a portion of the area, though not since the time of Mohammed. Of course, many of those people converted to Islam or Christianity. And, of course, the Samaritans were also in the area at the time, as their land was the area just north of Jerusalem.
