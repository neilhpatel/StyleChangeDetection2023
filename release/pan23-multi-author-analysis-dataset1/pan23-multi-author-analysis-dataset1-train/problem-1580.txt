Speak to the other beneficiaries and tell them your options you can accept the $25K the trustee is supposedly issuing and ignore what happened to remaining money assuming your grandmotherâ€™s house and assets sold to an amount of $700k OR you speak to an attorney that will work for your interest.
Thank you for the clarification. It would have been great if you had consulted with a trust attorney so that you could have asked how to get this trustee removed--with his history of financial misdeeds it would NOT have taken litigation to get him out.
I wish. Unfortunately, Both the trust and the will waive the bond. My mother was the original successor trustee but she died suddenly a few years ago. This guy was named as a successor after my mom. I doubt my grandmother ever thought he would ever be needed, and to be fair, I could see why grandma would name him as successor with his being a professional fiduciary and being well known in her community.
This is very next level. But you need an attorney that is working for you the beneficiary and an accountant that will actually review the books. From what you wrote it seems like the individuals involved in administering the estate have taken funds.
