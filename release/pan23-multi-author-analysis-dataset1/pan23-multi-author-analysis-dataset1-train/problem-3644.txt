I mean it seems, like many people in this post, you're playing mental gymnastics. You know and admit the US has done exactly this before, support "freedom fighters" or other groups financially and with military equipment, in South America and the Middle East which has led to many innocent deaths. We can see that they have done it again here with the SDF militia if Turkey is to be believed (and they have been constantly saying that this group is tied to the internationally recognized terrorist organization PKK) , But this time you say what... "this is different because..." "The US is just being scapegoated because..." ???
Turkey accused the United States of complicity in the attack because America has long maintained a military partnership with a Kurdish-led militia in Syria. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, during a visit to the site of the attack on Monday, dismissed condolence messages from the United States, saying this was like “the killer is among the first ones returning to the scene.”.
Did I say this is different? What mental gymnastics are at play here? My comment was a tongue-in-cheek remark about the US’ history regarding exactly what Turkey has accused it of.
