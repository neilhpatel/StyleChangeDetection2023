Jerry Mungadze, the North Texas therapist Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker credits with his mental health recovery, has a history of controversial statements and treatments, including a variation of "conversion" therapy and a belief that choice of crayon color can reveal whether a patient has been possessed by a demon.
Well, no. Scandals do matter. A politician who’s as unbelievably stupid and immoral as someone like Walker or Trump is obviously unqualified for office on that alone. Because even if they say all the right things policy-wise, they’re still a person and such obviously flawed people are going to bring those flaws into the job.

Exactly. It would be nice if they all reported on the issues and beliefs. If you don’t agree, don’t vote for them. Instead we just hear about scandals and why you shouldn’t vote for someone rather than reasons/beliefs that line up with your own.
