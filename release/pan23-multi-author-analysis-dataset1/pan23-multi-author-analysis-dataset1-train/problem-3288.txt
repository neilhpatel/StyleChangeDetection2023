Flann O'Brian once wrote of an imaginary reading service for people who had many books but didn't read them. The highest level of service would add scribbled intelligent marginal notes, like "yes: but see McCormick's critique of this". When I am looking at old academic books, mostly instead of intelligent notes I find yellow highlighter. In the first few chapters, many sections. Then fewer, and fewer, finally none. You can track the path of the student. First "I will TOTALLY learn Michel Foucault". Then, "I better mark this passage, even though I am not quite sure what it means". Then "I'll mark this, and figure it out later" then, "I'll mark this, and ask what it means and if it's important". Then just silence.....
From my modest experience as a tutor, plenty of students follow the method of highlighting what they think they need to read - which often means leaving out adverbs, qualifiers, parentheticals and a few odd digressions here and there - and keeping everything else. It saves some time, I suppose, and it does for funny answers when one decides that "contrary to that" and "not at all" are not significant enough to pass the highlighter test.
