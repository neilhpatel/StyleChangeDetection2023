Yeah, we know the parliament was against him and tried unsuccessfuly to impeach him legally. That doesn't negate nor justify the fact Castillo tried a self coup, an extremely illegal power grab, and got legitimately thrown in jail for it.
He did get elected democraticaly, but this has nothing to do with the recent events we're talking about : his illegal attempt at a Coup d'État. That's why you're downvoted.
yeah, when the president literally concentrates the power in his person, closes the parlament that was also choose by the people and literally wants to rewrite the entire constitution of the country and other country wants to give asylum to the same guy that wanted to be a dictator the oligarchs are the ones to blame when Peru doesn´t want him to run from justice.
Got lucky? Man you really know a way with words. OP was right, this was an organized coup from the richer far-right members of the government. If you follow thier previous tactics in the last few decades, you'd know this wasn't beneath them.
