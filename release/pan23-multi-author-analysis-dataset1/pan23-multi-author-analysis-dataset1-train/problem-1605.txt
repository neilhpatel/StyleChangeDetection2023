Not against any help for devastated people, but it shouldn’t the rich Arabs countries offer and act such things first.

This is accurate, but to give credit where it’s due: Saudi Arabia has sent six planes’ worth of material humanitarian aid to Turkey and 569,000 Saudi Arabian citizens raised a total of $51.2 million for survivors (as of yesterday); UAE businesses and the UAE Red Crescent have engaged in sizable philanthropic/fundraising drives while its royal family has donated roughly $13.6 million to Turkey and organised 22 planes with 640 tonnes of aid for both Turkey and Syria; Kuwait has sent firefighting and military teams and pledged $30 million for relief efforts in Turkey and Syria; Bahrain has dispatched military teams and a SAR team; and Qatar’s Emir has donated $13.7 million to survivors in Turkey and Syria.
