In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Ontario recently tried legislating an unwanted agreement on its education workers. They too would have been striking illegally and could lose their jobs. They said OK, letâ€™s do it, it would be easy for us to find new jobs in this economy, and impossible for the employer to find and train replacements for us. The Province/employer backed down and they returned to the bargaining table.
