US makes claim about Chinese fishing vessels invading territorial waters of other countries and do bottom trawling.
Gall? A sovereign nation can do whatever it wants, right? So what’s the problem? Didn’t that joke of a country, China, build a little island in the middle of the Philippine sea to stretch its tiny dick? Doesn’t China willfully enslave a million of its citizens because believing something a little different hurts the tiny, fragile egos of agnostic, corrupt Winnies? Don’t Chinese rockets fall from the sky, endangering random countries because it can’t even figure out controlled descent? Don’t rich cough corrupt cough Chinese companies pretend to invest in nations only to hold the assets and land hostage? Doesn’t China frequently displace its citizens making them homeless, just to build giant buildings that no one lives in, just so they can demolish them, resulting in untold amounts of pollution and human suffering? Seems to me like little, shitty China is nothing but a wannabe.
