In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yep. Just had this argument this morning. Buddy is of the opinion that with further gun control “we’d become just like North Korea or China”. The stupidity is nerve wracking. I’m of the thought process that the rampant gun violence is what is truly taking away American rights and “the American way of life”. People can’t go to school, work, out in public in general without this shit potentially happening. But no, people on the right need to keep worshipping their guns. I’m tired of it.
Many Republicans think that underage girls aren’t mentally mature enough to get an abortion but are mentally mature enough to give birth / raise a baby and are mentally capable of getting married, but all children aren’t mentally capable of understanding that LGBTQAI people exist, that drag queens can read stories, and actual history will upset the white children, while also fully supporting kindergartners and up having to have active shooter drills and if that should happen in their school they shouldn’t try to politicize it to demand stricter gun legislation.
