There is so much overt antisemitism all around the world that Trump and whatever is going on with American right wing conspiracists is nothing new or shocking to him. The American evangelicals still want to protect Israel and they view the Jewish government as an ally in the modern Crusades, even though they are fundamentally antisemitic, so Bibi will nurture that relationship as long as he can.
Bibi and the Israeli right are much more concerned with Iran and local military threats, and they perceive the American Republican party as hawkish along the same lines, so he will tolerate any antisemitism from the GOP as long as Christian conservatives continue to believe Israel must be protected from Muslims and want to continue pouring in military and economic support.
I'm not saying that the evangelicals are solely to blame. Far from it. However, I think they are working to feed the flames and make things as bad as possible.
