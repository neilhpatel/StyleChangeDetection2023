For the year 1940-1941, nothing much would have changed, except that you would see the "vert-de-gris", German uniforms, here and there, and that you would sense a mood of hostility against teachers.

Being back alive from the front would have made you look like a coward in the eyes of conservatives, because you were supposed to show the example and die for your country. In the Revue des Deux-Mondes during the Summer, Philippe Pétain would accuse teachers of inciting defeat by spreading pacifism and socialism, and some measures would be taken against them.

It's Monday. You have to raise the flag and sing "Maréchal, nous voilà!" with your students. Some are missing. You have no news from your Jewish ex-colleague who was sent in a work camp last June. Hopefully they feed him well. You are luckier, you teach. At least, you have a job for as long as you can put up with the Pétain thing.
