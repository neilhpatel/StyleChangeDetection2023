Salt has been a staple ingredient of world cuisine for millennia. It could be called the "first and most common of the spices", and there's archeological evidence of it already being used around the year 6000 BC. Salt can be mined relatively easy, as to get it you mostly need to evaporate seawater to extract the salt. Salt is not endemic to any particular area, you can get it anywhere where there is access to the sea or, less common, where there are salt mines. It was a common ingredient in Antiquity, if somewhat expensive, as the production of salt was a costly and labour-intensive work, prone to health problems on the workers. We have uncovered rests of salt offerings in Ancient Egyptian tombs as far as the 3rd millennium BC, and by Roman Imperial times salt was incredibly common. There's the enduring myth that salt was used as a payment for early Roman soldiers, hence the word "salary", but that is just a speculation from Pliny the Elder, writing in the 1st century AD, when soldiers had been paid in cash for already many centuries.
Salt wasn’t prohibitively expensive. It was just pricy enough to make extensive salt recovery worthwhile. In Diocletian’s famous price edict he set the price of salt to be the same as the price of wheat. But while a modius of wheat would make about 10 days worth of bread, a modius of salt would be enough to cover a year’s worth of salt. Salt was expensive the way grain was expensive.
