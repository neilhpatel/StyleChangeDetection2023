US Air Force from an air conditioned room somewhere in Virginia: "Authorization for Tomahawks is go, code Tango Bravo Sierra 2783 Delta. Target coordinates 37UDB 05802.593 51687.793, launch when ready. Anyone got an extra coke?".
Pro-Kremlin pundits are furious over US President Joe Biden's surprise trip to Ukraine's capital on Monday, criticizing Russia for allowing it to happen and calling it a "humiliation" for Moscow.
I have no idea. I don’t follow that stuff. I’m saying, I’ve never even seen any pro Russian sentiment in the south. So saying that conservatives are putin sympathizers is silly. It’s not true. Everybody hates Russia. So quit with the lies.
There’s been literal Republican congresspeople who’ve voiced support for Russia and iterate Republican talking points.
Yeah again, it’s not that I don’t know any. I’ve literally never even seen a pro Putin or Russian flag anywhere in the south. And I drive around quite a bit. You know what I have seen quite a bit of? Liberals who romanticize the idea of communism. You and I see things differently, and that’s OK.
