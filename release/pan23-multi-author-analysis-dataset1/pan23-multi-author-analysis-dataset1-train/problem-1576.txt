Were you just going for something out of left field to complete the list, or is this a reference to something from actual fiction? It’s… oddly specific.
The "weird tale" and horror fiction as genre were more strongly solidified in the early 20th century as it pursued different paths as novels, short stories, theater, and film - the emergence of pulps like Weird Tales (1923-1954) created a market for horror fiction which was emulated by other magazines, and especially in the 1930s there emerged the distinct "Weird Terror" or "Shudder Pulps" - while Weird Tales sometimes skirted censorship laws with nude covers or the subtle hints at necrophilia, incest, or gore, pulps like Horror Stories and Terror Tales avoided the supernatural but doubled down on bloody sadomasochism, torture, and women in peril.
The history of horror in the mid-to-late 20th century is seen with both a vast diversification of horror in different media and forms, and a growing ability by writers and artists to articulate those horrors as explicitly as they wish. It is not that Alien (1979) was the first extraterrestrial horror story - but it was a fresh approach to a large body of work where the popular forms of extraterrestrials became more familiar and correspondingly less horrific than in previous decades. The Xenomorph was no "little green man" or faceless robot on a flying saucer like The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951).
