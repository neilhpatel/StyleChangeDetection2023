A while ago, I had read this story about a famous person, I believe it was a scientist, who could not figure out which major to choose in college. He ended up choosing whatever came first on the list of subjects the college had to offer. He then went on to come up with many theories and won awards for the same (I am not sure if he won any Nobel Prizes, though). Pretty mainstream guy, I think, because I'm not a science-y person, and yet I have read about this person. I wonder if any of you recall reading this story somewhere and can remember the name of the person in question. Thanks!
My point isn't that these were the dominant hairstyles of the Middle Ages - nearly all my evidence is monarchs from just one kingdom - but rather to point out that just like now fashion changed but older trends could return again much later. The Middle Ages was big and long and complicated, this applies as much to its fashion as it does to its politics or war.
The Middle Ages lasted approximately a thousand years, and as you would expect with a time period that long fashion changed a lot. There were huge variations across time and geography in what hairstyles were considered fashionable. I am far from an expert on the topic (I'm only really comfortable even sort of answering this question because its Friday Free for All so we can be a little more casual). The type of fashion that crosses over into my line of research is mostly male aesthetics at the end of the Middle Ages. I would note that we know a lot more about what was fashionable in Europe in the latter half of the Middle Ages than we do for earlier periods. This is because we just generally have a ton more evidence for the later periods, especially artistic evidence which is especially useful for this kind of analysis.
