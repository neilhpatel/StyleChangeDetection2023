This conflict is far from over, Putin's public declaration of continued support for the army and his attempt to flip the narrative to one of "defending the motherland" is indicative of his resolve. He believes that the West will grow tired of sending billions in aid to Ukraine and will gradually lose interest. Russian disinformation campaigns will increase as will funding for Republican candidates, the NRA, and right-wing publications.
Ngl this is the most lazily written piece ever. There was no way Ukraine would have been conquered with the pathetic state of Russia's military. Not that western aid didn't help, on the contrary it did help a lot but no amount of the lack of western aid would make up for the fact Russia underestimated the ferocity of the resistance they would encounter and the inadequacy of their ability to supply their invading troops.
You would hope that EU would step up. EU with $16T economy, third largest in back of US and China, has the resources necessary to support Ukraine and defeat Russia.
