Since the start I've vehemently stated that this is just a Sword of Damocles. We can't compromise the rights and liberties that define us, that our ancestors died for. They can't break that. If they use nukes or not isn't up for question, there's no alternative: We're not going to bend the knee and arse for dictators to fuck. Go ahead, try and nuke us and see why the west outspends russia over 100 times to 1. Of which half was NATO-countries working on anti-ICBM/airplane doctrines.
"May?" No doubt already has. Russia isn't going to abide by anything, it seems. And with that nut at the trigger, it's a scary thought. Which is why he's stating so publicly.
Yeah they could still kill billions but that's entire beside the point; There are things worth dying for, and if someone gave you the choice to live under someone like putin where you'd be jailed for 90% of political ideologies we have or even talking about them, 80% of our cultures, 70% of our sexualities, if you'd take a true moment and realise that if you'd tolerate that your children would be next: Then no, there's no choice here.
The equation has changed. Ukraine is attacking inside their borders. I don’t want that however much they me be ethically writhing their rights. That’s how WW3 really starts.
If it becomes WW3, does it really matter who is to blame? Death doesnt care who started it. I believe that is avoidable if Ukraine just defends. They are kicking the shit out of Russia within their borders. Let that suffice.
