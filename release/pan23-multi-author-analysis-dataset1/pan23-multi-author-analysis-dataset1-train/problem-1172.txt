Soviet aerospace development involved Design Bureaus (abbreviated as OKB in Russian). The OKB are very roughly analogous to Western aircraft companies in that they had were fairly self-contained and would have requirements passed onto them by the government for competition. OKBs generally specialized in certain areas, and often times politics would play a part in procurement. In general, the trend through the Cold War was that Tupolev was specialized around bomber development, Ilyushin around transports, Sukhoi around interceptors and heavier tactical aircraft, and Mikoyan-Gurevich around frontal aviation. Yakovlev fell more into trainer aircraft following WW2, although we also see them have some niches with VTOL aircraft (Yak-36, Yak-38, and Yak-41) as well as some long-range fighters and a failed bid at the contender for what became the Su-27/MiG-29.
Interesting answer, thanks. Do you know, was there any philosophy of fostering competition between the design bureaus as part of this approach, as a way to keep quality high? Or is that a western/capitalist kind of idea that wouldn't pertain?
