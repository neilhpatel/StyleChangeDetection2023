Oh, I think I can answer this one! I'm honestly excited to have a chance to talk about this because it's also a subject I've found to be fascinating. The short version is that it only took effort from men who weren't already fighting Ivan the Terrible's (better translated as Ivan the Formidable but I digress) European wars, and for Russian economic interests in fur trade, made profitable by the river layout of European Russia and Siberia combined.
Hello! I am Russian and I really enjoyed this answer, in fact I am from a region where the Stroganovs and Yermak were really important. I don’t know whether you know it but there is a popular video on YouTube called ‘Russia’s geography problem’ which attempts to explain why Russia is so big in terms of a 4X strategy player that can see the entire map and also plan out his game 300 years in advance. calling Siberian permafrost ‘buffer zones’ that would protect the flat European Plane and the like. It almost gave me an aneurysm but now it’s a popular refrain repeated by armchair specialists on Russian history, so I really appreciate the nuanced and quality response. I know that askhistorians is excellent on quality but it still encourages me to see it in action on a complicated question with a popular false answer.
