Other critics of Marshall's work claim that his data is in fact, invention, essentially accusing him of fabricating data for the purpose of his writings, and have even gone as far as to question his own accounts of his experience fighting in the First World War, with there being some rather damning evidence that he could not have been present at the various battles he claimed he participated in for a variety of verifiable reasons, for instance, his claims to have been in Bantheville during the fighting there, when he was in fact, records show he was taking the West Point Entrance exam that day.
And therein lies the rub. Marshall claimed to have kept copious records of his interviews that backed up his statements. After his death, these were found to not exist. Some of his military assistants who accompanied him during his interview sessions with troops did not recall him keeping detailed notes. It seems that Marshall did not collect "quantifiable data;" rather, he formed impressions from talking to troops recently returned from combat and used those impressions to craft theories on the nature of war. That's, uh . . . not a great methodology.
I'm not sure how you are sourcing your claim, but by simply looking at field manuals from the era Marshall did his study in, and even prior to direct US engagement to the Second World War, the idea of suppressing fire and covering fire was well established as battlefield doctrine for all forms of infantry, specifically rifle and heavy weapons battalions.
Indeed the most basic tactical doctrine explained to infantry for attack and advancing as described in infantry field manuals, is described in military parlance as the Four Fs:
So the idea that suppressing fire is a modern doctrine that was not taught to US Infantry in the Second World War is not a very coherent one. Combine this with Marshall's frequent references to human nature in regards to firing their weapon in "Men Against Fire", his conclusion is rather clear.
