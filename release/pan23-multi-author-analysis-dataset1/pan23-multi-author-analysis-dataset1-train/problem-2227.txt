Finally, to answer your question about the lady, her arms are emblazoned as proboscides, which means trunks (as in elephant trunks). It is a rare ornament that mostly exists in german coat of arms. As for their signification, it is hard to find one, but a suggestion is that they represent horns ; horns are both used to symbolize dignity and power.From there, two possible explanations either the lady herself has a signification that was lost in time, and she is the person of dignity and power, but it's unlikely ;- or the bearer of the coat of arms is the person of dignity of power, and it is linked to the helm, which leads us back to the interpretation of a high-ranking officer.
This is a great answer! I only want to mention that the vast majority of arms historically have very shallow symbolism.
Yes ! I'm fixing it immediatly, thanks for pointing it out. English isn't my first language and despite having a good level now, I sometimes get fooled by what we call "fake friends" : words that write or pronounce the same, but mean different things.
Excellent answer. For a moment I thought this was the single most comprehensive response Iâ€™d ever read on r/heraldry, then I went back up and checked which sub this was.
