and Bob was very unfair to me, Bob Woodward, just so you understand I gave him great interviews, I gave him whatever he wanted, and he did it, and I knew he was gonna do it, I kept saying you're hopefully going to, but probably not, going to treat me fairly, and he was nice to me with words, "thank you, Sir," and then all of a sudden here comes the Political Hitjob of the Year. he really did a number on me with a Fake and Unfair Book, full of Lies about your Favorite President. I give him Gold, way better than Nixon, and he turns around and treats me like a dog. it's very very disrespectful to the 45th President of the United States. ok, good night, enjoy yourselves.

Probably never. If he had stroke tomorrow and was no longer able to walk or speak, they'd still wheel him out at rallies and events and say: "Look what they did to him Donate now to make sure they don't do this to you or your loved ones".
