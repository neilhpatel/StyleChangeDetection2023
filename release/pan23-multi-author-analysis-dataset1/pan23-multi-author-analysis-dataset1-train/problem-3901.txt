Russian Empire still existed, as did Greater Hungary. both are just crying about it now rather than focusing on their actual countries.
Really? Sorry, I had no idea. In any case facts don’t mean a thing to anyone here when hate has to be strong. I gave you a context of why Orban will veto. You don’t have to like his reasoning, but it’s still a fact. This is why Reddit sucks.
Ignoring Hungary's incentive and focusing on Russia: Russia is actively invading another country. Sanctions support limiting the influence of a particularly threatening country.
2. Public trust. Paks suffered an INES 3 incident due to the inadequate fuel rod cleaning equipment sent by the French Framatome company (which the Hungarian agency did not notice was inadequate), and one of the units had to be shut down for a year due to the resulting damage and radiactive gas leaks.
For example. In 2014, when the crisis in Ukraine was already under way, Hungary contracted Russia’s Rosatom to build two new nuclear power plant blocks in Paks, without announcing a public tender. The project is financed by a €10 billion loan from Russia and a majority of that is going to Lörinc Mészáros who owns the contractring agency that will be building it, and is one of orban's keys. Presumably, the ONLY reason this is being vetoed is because of the threat to Orban's power structure and influence.
The incentive FOR the veto is mostly people in power wishing to preserve that power by aligning with those that got them there.
