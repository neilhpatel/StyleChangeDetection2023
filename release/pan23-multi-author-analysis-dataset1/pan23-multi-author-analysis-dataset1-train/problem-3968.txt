Which time period? Written texts of folk tales date from the later 18th century with the work of the Grimm brothers. This coincided with the ascent of modern educational theorizing, in work by Rousseau (building on Locke and earlier empirical philosophers of the Enlightenment) and Mary Wollstonecraft, among countless others. Rousseau advocated for special courses of reading for children (works like Robinson Crusoe), but said nothing of spooky or supernatural tales that we think of as children’s fairy tales. Indeed, the telling of such stories to children was sometimes aligned with the toxic influence of “old wives tales”, which is something we see for example in the early 19th century story “The Sandman” by ETA Hoffmann, where a nanny figure frightens the protagonist Nathanael with the story of the Sandman.
You're absolutely correct to call out the question of what is true. This version is true to itself; my caution is to understand what it may and may not have been: it may not reflect what was in oral tradition; rather it may reflect one author's literary undertaking.
