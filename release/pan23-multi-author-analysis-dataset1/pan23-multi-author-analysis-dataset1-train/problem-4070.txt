I just wanted to go back to my original job duties where I was at a remote location and these sites. I would be fine one a week but they ignored it. By not just letting me “go back to work “ they increased the work load for another employee who handles the other remote site. So he was now encumbered with now double the work load so people’s issues were now not getting resolve the same day. Instead now he had to work around his existing duties and added more stress on him. Simply put I just wanted to go back to being part of the team but instead they babysat me.
Being a terrible manager does not generally become illegal because their particular brand of terribleness affects some employees more than others; sounds like he's an Equal Opportunity Asshole.
Thank you. I’m still been trying to put the pieces together and make sense of all of this. Feels like a dream I am lost in. Most of my life experiences has been either neglect or feeling of I never mattered to others. Even when I was nothing but loyal.
