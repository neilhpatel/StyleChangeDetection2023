In addition to the naval conquests of the Cholas, are there not much more ancient accounts of Indian seafarers in southeast asia and the Persian Gulf? I'm thinking of the kingdom of Kalinga and it's relationship with the Javanese (?), or the Brahmi graffiti on that island off the coast of Yemen.
An addition I would like to add (which is related to this question, especially if you are Indian and, thus, the reason for posting this very question) is there is a tendency in Indian media and to some extent in Indian school curriculum to portray India (and the kingdoms that used to make up the subcontinent) as having never invaded neighbouring kingdoms/countries in its entire history, which is not true. The naval expeditions of the Cholas is an instance proving this wrong. There are also the methods that independent India employed to incorporate many of the princely states after 1947 to name a few (albeit very few). Anyway, this is a different topic that merits a separate explanation but suffice to say nationalism and patriotism have been a major force in shaping this historical narrative.
