The IAH is free to file, and you can do so online or at the courthouse. Expect to spend an hour or two on each Petition as itâ€™s quite a process. When you fill it out, you have to give a detailed list all of the incidents, including the dates. Be sure to look up everything you need to bring to fill out the injunction.
Speaking to the parents of the known bullies is the most effective situation without privating her account since the police cannot really punish a minor without a direct threat, and creating a restraining order for all online bullies (there are people that literally dedicate their days to finding targets and bullying) would be costly and overall ineffective since finding the identities of these individuals would be near impossible without hired help (assuming the bullies use alternate accounts as stated in the text.).
If the judge issues the injunction, his clerk will fill out the information and have it served to the defendant in person before the effective date listed on the order, which you will pay for. The cost varies according to district and lenh of drive. The injunction is good for a year and you and your daughter must keep a copy of it with you always.
