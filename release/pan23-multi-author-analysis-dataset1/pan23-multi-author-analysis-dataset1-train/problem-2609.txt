Ill help clarify my statement, if it offended you so much. You seemed to infer from my statement, that "fentanyl is fake news, and doesn't exist", and got all haughty and blustering "w-w-well you don't care about what the CDC says on X, but everyone defended the CDC when it came to Y", hypocrisy, blah blah.
Or, to say it a different way, if they didn't care about covid, but they care about spooky border fentanyl, they either have ridiculously off-base risk assessment skills, or they're putting forth a bullshit agenda.
And if people (again, right wingers mostly) didn't give two shits about covid, then the appropriate amount of shits the'yre allowed to give about fentanyl (while still being expected to be taken seriously) is about 0.25 shits.
And again, amongst the right wing, people seem to wax fearful about fentanyl 5 times as much as they would covid, which...is pants on head stupid, because the mortality data cancels that argument out rather instantly.
But to see all of this shit, nearly universally from the right, about so much fentanyl coming across the border, and being a major killer, and major threat, and its super duper dangerous, and ultra major priority number 1 for safety...no. It isn't. More people die yearly as a result of diabetes (102,000 in 2020). About as many people died from the flu (53,500 in 2020).
