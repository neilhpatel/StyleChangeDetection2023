The usual Russian facade. Announce major changes, then either nothing changes or everything goes to shit. You can't do anything in a country that corrupt.
Certainly. But numbers are still a huge deal. Ukraine generally seems to have better drone recon and quicker artillery responses than Russia for example, but this has been an artillery war with some huge percentage of casualties being from artillery and when Ukraine can shoot something like a few thousand rounds a day vs Russia which was shooting something like 50,000 a day, that is very concerning for Ukraine. Look at Bakhmut and Soledar and the Donetsk in general. These are more akin to ww1 battles with trenches and massive artillery duels than the type of war we thought we had transitioned to in the West. To say that artillery isn't what's making a difference is a very strange statement about this war. That's all this war has been.
Russia had extremely well-working tactics of relying on using agent-provocateurs to terrorize and cleanse the target nation (killing off local leaders, businessmen, probable opponents and activists), then night/thermal vision in tandem with precise artillery/air attacks and heavy signals intelligence technology. In 2008 Georgia and 2014 Ukraine, it was nightmare to fight against it. There were deep studies and . (This talk also explains and predicts current war and its (likely) outcome super precisely - 7 years ago! -, a good watch).
Doesn't mean the PLAAF is better either, just means that they're organized differently, because transportation and logistics and things that aren't missile carriers are very important for the USN, which has global committments, while the PLAAF is basically just going to be in and around China, so they naturally have less of a focus on transports (and a few hundred pretty old, definitely obsolete jets).
Putin can't cut his losses. A defeat in Ukraine would end him so it will drag on if for no other reason than Putin wanting to save his own neck.
