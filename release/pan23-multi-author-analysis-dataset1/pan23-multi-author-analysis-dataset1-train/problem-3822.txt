california has an which includes hot/cold water (and one would presume the water must not be contaminated or otherwise unpotable due to on-property issues). CA requires that the landlord be notified and be given a reasonable amount of time to repair the issue. if the landlord exceeds a "reasonable amount of time" for your specific municipality, you can withhold rent (it's recommended but not required in CA to place the funds into an escrow account) until the issue is resolved.
Take photos of the tank and the rats. Take a large water sample and send some to a lab to be tested or have a water testing company come and do it. Give doctors results of tests.
If the tank had a proper lid on it that was secured properly, to pin this on the landlord you will need to prove either they knew about the hole in the lid and failed to fix it in a reasonable time frame, or that they should have inspected the tank more frequently and found the problem, or that they knew there was a rat problem and failed to act, or other similar line of reasoning.
