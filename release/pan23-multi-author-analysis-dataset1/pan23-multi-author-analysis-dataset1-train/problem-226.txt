On September 13-15 Azerbaijan attacked Armenia proper, killed 200+ Armenian soldiers and occupied 100+ square km of Armenian territory, it's not about Nagorno-Karabakh anymore, it's about exterritorial corridor to Nakhijevan.
Yeah but, its not working out to well for him at the moment. Although I fully encourage Russia to ‘liberate’ Armenia and the nefariously backsliding Kazakhstan into the peaceful and loving embrace of Mother Russia.

It's so pathetic that in this day and age an old imbecile like that believes that annexing other nations is what takes to make their own shit hole better and more powerful instead to actually properly administering it to be better. He knows nothing about modern economics and technological advancements of the previous 100 years. It's people, not the dirty beneath his feet, that makes nations great these days.
