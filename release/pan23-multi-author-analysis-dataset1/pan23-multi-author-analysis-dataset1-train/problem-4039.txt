I'm not a lawyer. There could be some legal kung fu that would see her lose the house if she's not careful. Though it's also possible a lawyer will tell you that taking a loan out for these repairs will circumvent the legal argument the original predators are bringing. It's likely your mother will need her own lawyer for at least one court date anyway.
Title insurance covers things that are recorded on the land records but were not found and listed as exclusions on the policy like an incorrect description of the property boundaries, its size, dwellings built, dimensions, etc as described on the title policy, undiscovered liens (for eg: unpaid federal taxes, property taxes, personal debts of current/former owners of title, utility charges, probate taxes, etc), undiscovered inland/wetlands located on or near the property and its regulations and effects, failure to locate and secure the Certificate of Demise (death) issued by a Probate Court if any deed in the chain of title gives a life use benefit to somebody (usually found in quit claim deeds between family members), failure to secure a recorded mortgage, etc.
Wow. Aren’t they shady. Not even a website. These are vultures masquerading as a non profit. They are definitely doing something illegal. I hope you uncover it and bury them. You’re mom might come out of this ahead.
Rule 10 of the RPC should be consulted, as it discusses the fact that the legal profession is "self-regulated" and resulting extra responsibilities of the Courts to regulate professional conduct, which overlaps with the private right of action the victims have to sue for malpractice, and sanctions that parties of court can apply for for the violations.
Blue sky idea. Take a mortgage out on the property to perform the repairs, rent the house to pay the mortgage, let the banks cabal of lawyers fight these predators.
