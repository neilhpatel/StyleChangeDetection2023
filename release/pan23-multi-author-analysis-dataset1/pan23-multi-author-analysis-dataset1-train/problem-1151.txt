It has nothing to do with religion, it is about old nut case wanting to exert his dominance. There are pictures of his grand daughters and nieces(or grand-nieces) with short skirts and no hijabs. Same with many middle-east royal families. Look at Dubai's Queen for example. The royal families of each kingdom is huge, they have different rules compared to the average women in their country. Lot of them live in LA, UK, Toronto and etc. They go to clubs like any other chicks.
While I respect your opinion I don’t think removing religion solves anything, non-religious dictatorships and authoritarian regimes aren’t exactly uncommon.
The hashtags mean something. Posting on your Instagram stories mean something. Time and time again, the call from Iran is the same, “Be Our Voice”.
Abrahamic religion and religious fundamentalism is a historical driver of intolerance and persecution. The only time it's been a force for good from my perspective is when good people reform it to fit modern morals and remove it from government. At that point it's a diluted form of itself that humans have modified to be less destructive and more tolerant.
