I haven't forgotten about you! It's much harder to find solid info on the tankodesantniki than I would have guessed, owing largely to frequent wartime table of organization and equipment changes including some temporary TO&Es for severely understrenh units, as well as the Soviet predilection for ad-hoc task-oriented groupings. This also probably owes to, as I'll dig deeper on in a moment, the fact that tankodesantniki were not a distinct unit type the way Wehrmacht panzergrenadieres or modern mechanized infantry are. Rather, they were a semi-improvised (albeit so frequently improvised as to earn formal instructions in tank and infantry manuals) task-dictated role for infantry units.
Thank you for this amazing answer! I never expected anything as comprehensive as this - I fully understand how hard it is to find any information on ad-hoc/non-official units (considering how many times Chinese units were shattered and hastily merged together in the Sino-Japanese conflict...).

For secondary reading, Neal Dando's From Tobruk to Tunis: The impact of terrain on British operations and doctrine in North Africa, 1940-1943 and Kaushik Roy's Fighting Rommel: The British Imperial Army in North Africa during the Second World War, 1941â€“1943 both have sections on the columns.
2. It's not a traditional academic source, but honestly the best place I've found for the small-scale TO&Es has been Despite the name, Axis History Forum is a surprisingly credible and well-sourced place.
