Yes, because fossil fuel is incumbent. The infrastructure, business model, laws, contracts, subsidies, lobbyists, PR is already there.
Two. Your supposed understanding of environmental sciences shows that when it comes to radiation exposure and toxicity levels for tritium, you don't know shit.
5. Bioaccumulation, many fish giving off radiation inside another fish will cause a higher concentration of radioactive materials than the surrounding water.
About time... It's tritium folks. Occurs naturally when sun rays interact water molecules, so there is plenty in the ocean already. Though in very very low concentration. But Pacific ocean is pretty big, so a tad more won't be noticed.
In a world where renewables are the near future dominant power generator, fossil fuel funding anti-nuclear campaigns is like abacus companies funding anti-calculator campaigns.
2. Safety regulations are based on LD (lethal dose studies) very strict countries regulate to LD 50 meaning "safe" kills 50% of marine life.
I can attest that LD 50 is considered a strict national standard in my country (so less than 50.01% of the population exposed to the dumped concentration die) which is considered acceptable in acute studies, not chronic exposure (as long term, low dumping rates would be). My country has comparatively very strict environmental standards.
One. I didn't say tritium cannot bioaccumulate. So accusing me of saying that, is a strawman fallacy.
