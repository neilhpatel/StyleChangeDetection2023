I mean Greece and Turkey never really got on, but he has definitely made it worse by far. But I donâ€™t think he wants to start a war with NATO, who would likely come in overthrow him quickly, recognize the Kurdish people that would instantly ally with the Iraqi Kurds to push for international recognition. This would cause a huge shit show with Iran and Syria as they have large Kurdish populations. In the mean time Greece gets to live peacefully while Turkey, Iraq, and Iran go to complete shit.
Obviously. Whenever it gets serious US deploy aircraft carrier in agean and germany start mediating between both sides. It is same shit going on for decades.
Assuming that Russia's nuclear arsenal is not full of duds (which is extremely unlikely given that it and the US held mutual inspections of each other's arsenals up until the COVID pandemic broke in late 2019/early 2020) and the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces don't mutiny when given the order to strike, the United States may be able to survive the resulting nuclear exchange in relatively good shape, but European NATO countries and especially the nearby non-NATO countries both in and close to Europe are unlikely to be anywhere near as fortunate.
