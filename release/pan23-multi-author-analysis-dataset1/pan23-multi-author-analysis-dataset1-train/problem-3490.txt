becuase italy was first state to become fasist through democratic means. In Italy, there were economic and social issues that came from the first world war. Alot extremems can from the left and the right. However in 1922, an goverment was formed under beneto musillini. A fascit one. In 2023 Mussalini ordered the assasination of the communist leader at the time. There were protest but the goverment did not care. Then another leader of the opposition dead, then another etc. Apathy gripped the nation. Italians beleived that the govement killed because they were fascist. It was in their nature. So as dead bodies piled up more and more people saw it as a way of life. As human nature. the state could kill and no one would bait an eye cuz at least it was not them.
