Of course there’s always a risk when you have large numbers of animals living close together but the squalid conditions and the way they’re kept literally on top of each other is another pandemic waiting to happen.
Agreed. I’m not sure why he took me there. It was in the mid sixties in a rural area and I was about ten. I think he knew the guy that ran it and it was obviously a shitshow even to a ten year old. Luckily it did impress on me how horrific it was and was one of those first times when you learn that humans can be pretty terrible.
Absolutly. But especially ones like this. I can understand food animals, I don't like it but I get it. There is zero fucking reason shit like mink farms should still be a thing.
We need to stop focusing on the obvious (Re: Clearly attributable to Covid because a person has died while actively having a covid infection) Covid mortality and go back to the conversation about how Covid is killing people months after the fact, still permanently disabling millions, and yet is now treated completely incomprehensibly as if it's gone away when it has not.
Mink farms are a nightmare. My father took me to see one when I was a kid. The smell was horrific and basically it was a cannibalistic system. The minks grew in crowded cages, they were killed and skinned and their bodies were ground up to feed back into the food chain.
