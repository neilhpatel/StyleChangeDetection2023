The thing to keep in mind is that each were written by their authors for different reasons -- Hornblower is basically a set of morality tales that are set in a seafaring setting, and do not reference actual historical events very often. O'Brian's books are studies of friendship, particularly male friendship, but in a nautical setting that is often based on real events that happened in the Royal Navy of the time. (HMS Sophie capturing Cacafuego is based on a real battle between HMS Speedy and the Spanish ship Gamo.) O'Brian spent much more time reading contemporaneous accounts of battles, journals, diaries and other historical materials to be able to understand the setting for his stories, whereas Forester seems more to have consulted some general naval histories of the period.
Right. The policy on excluding fish is much older, though. When the Admiralty published its first Regulations and Instructions relating to His Majestyâ€™s Service at Sea in 1733, fish had already been out of favor for some time. from the first Regulations - notice that there's no fish on it. There was a substitution list as well, which listed items that could be substituted if something on the list wasn't available, and that doesn't include fish either. That's not to say that no salted fish were allowed on board, but rather that the Admiralty would absolutely not pay for it.
