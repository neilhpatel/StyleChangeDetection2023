I think he's toast. The midterms proved how toxic maga culture is. The GOP may be a lot of things, but they aren't stupid. They have to clean house. It will be painful in the long run, but necessary.
Astroturf away but the majority of GOP voters I am seeing across social medias are blaming neocon leadership, especially regarding national party funding aid to primary winners.
Agreed. DeSantis is dangerous because he’s a worse version of Trump, in a cleaner, well disguised, more politically, acceptable package. He also seems more capable of playing the political long game; meaning he’ll be more tolerated, and for longer, and that’s dangerous. Trump was like an MLM-scam, a lot of enthusiasm over buzzwords and potential, creating hype to disguise that fact that nothing was underneath of benefit. Those at the top of the scheme are the only ones to benefit, but it’s a small slip to a sharp drop.
