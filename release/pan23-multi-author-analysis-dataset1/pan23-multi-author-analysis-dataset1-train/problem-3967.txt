For reference, the idea of Wasson et al. -- and many not-very-rigorous discussions before them, including the likes of Robert Graves and Carl Ker√©nyi -- is that a drink prepared in the course of the initiation rite, a kykeon, contained a psychotropic substance. A kykeon normally means a drink containing barley and usually pennyroyal, designed to refresh someone after exertion, or for medicinal purposes. In the case of Eleusis, the idea is supposedly that the barley was infected with ergot. That isn't actually impossible, but (a) there's absolutely no reason to think it; (b) ergot can be decidedly poisonous; (c) ancient medical writers discuss the effects of kykeons and they show no awareness at all of any potential psychotropic effects other than the fact that it's refreshing.
No, they do not. But they are found within the bud, so it's not impossible a little of the psychotropic substances might be present. But you'd have to eat a lot.
