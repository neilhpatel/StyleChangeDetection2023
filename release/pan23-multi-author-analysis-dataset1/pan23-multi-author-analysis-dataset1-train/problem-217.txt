The real answer is that until they can prove this theory, we have no reason to believe a massive impact occured so recently. There is no consensus in the archaeological community that such an event occured, and thus trying to speculate how it impacted the world is a bit like trying to speculate how aliens shaped WW2 or how Bigfoot influenced US foreign policy during the Civil War.
I simply enjoy knowledge. I got hung up on this topic because I see a trend in our education that puts effort to do their best not to stray too far from what what know about our "linear history". Look at the skulls we found in the foothills of Peru for example, not only do they suggest completely different migration patters from what we thought before, they may not have even been homo sapiens. I love for knowledge let me to this theory, not the other way around. If I'm wrong that's awesome, it means we disproved a theory clouding our view of the truth, but that hasn't happened and we still don't know how this event occurred. This theory is plausible and it's consequences seem varied. I see absolutely no harm in exploring a reasonable hypothetical, we do it in physics all the time. My original question wasn't even deploring the idea this even was caused by a cosmic impact, simply in the occurrence if it was, what effects could we see; but if you absolutely refuse to explore the topic, I suppose I will look for others to discuss the topic with.
