While there _is_ the psych thing too, I recently heard the actual reason is so you'd have to give a bit of change, so it would have to go through the register, so you couldn't just pocket the money. .
Reconciliation and reconstruction is superior to reparations. Trying to overburden the Germans is exactly what led to the creation of a situation like WW2 Germany and the power of a Hitler type person. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past. It seems u partly agree things should be done differently, but your intended solution sounds like they should’ve been even harsher instead of more lenient. I don’t think that’s a good idea. That will just create a new more determined enemy that is full of hate for you later down the line.
Exactly! Pretending to be a free and fair country. 9000 is a joke - he's not criticising Putin, Putin already said mistakes had been made in the mobilisation. This guy's agreeing with Putin. The implication that this is brave is like bravely telling Putin he's only the 5th most handsome man on the planet.
