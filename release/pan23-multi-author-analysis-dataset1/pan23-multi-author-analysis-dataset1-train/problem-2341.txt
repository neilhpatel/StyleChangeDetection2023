From type 1a falchions to Indian tulwars, Turkish Pala, and Persian shamshir, fine-edged cutting weapons have proven to be effective against layered textiles. The ability of a fine, hard edge to cut fibres is part of the reason broadhead-style arrows are more effective than needlepoint styles against gambesons, and the same physical principles apply to sword design.
While it's true we typically think of textile armors being most susceptible to penetrative thrusts, multiple instances of convergent evolution in weapon design across nations and centuries developed cutting weapons with extremely fine edges to deal with layered textiles.
The development of arms and armor is complicated, and the impact of material, technology, fighting systems, fashion, tradition, and the arms and armor of neighbouring regions all play a part in determining how weapons and protective equipment are designed.
Fair enough. I wanted to point it out since the question was about India. And for a period of history northern India was in direct conflict with armies coming from Persia.
