>An enforced disappearance occurs when a person is deprived of their liberty and authorities refuse to acknowledge the detention or to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the detainee, placing them beyond the protection of the law. In an armed conflict, this may amount to or involve multiple war crimes, and when an enforced disappearance occurs with the intention of removing the detainee from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time, it is prosecutable as a crime against humanity under the International Criminal Court’s statute.
Don't even go there. You are responsible for your own actions. She sealed her fate. Sure she's a victim. But why stay though? And she can bring her loved ones with her. I didn't say that she leave her loved ones behind?
So now you’re moving the goalposts to “before the war”, essentially blaming Ukraine for not preemptively abandoning their country, and at the same time, trying to contradict the choir of Russian trolls saying “It is just military exercise” for the following four months between Nov and the invasion.
Oh I agree. But was she expecting to correct the whole of Russia by staying as an activist in Ukraine, as it is being invaded?
