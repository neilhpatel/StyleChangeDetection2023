She can still sue the other driver, which gives her the capacity to enforce the judgement through things like garnishing wages or seizing money in her bank account, but the sad fact is that many people who do not have insurance on the car are unable to afford the premiums, and aren't going to have money to seize and often make too little money to legally garnish wages. A judgement from a civil suit does give her the ability to try to collect for much longer than the statute of limitations to bring the suit, so if at some point in the future the other driver becomes solvent, it is possible that she will collect... Eventually.
She can sue the driver. How does she know that this driver has no insurance? Did the police confirm that.
Unfortunately, if the at-fault driver has no insurance and has no money to pay a judgement if your friend sues, there isn't a third option unless your friend has collision/uninsured driver coverage and her own insurer cover the repair or total loss payout.
I agree with that. I think she was just trying to get the cheapest available insurance she could get and in Ohio you have to at least be able to have liability insurance. Unfortunately she has been in a rough spot for a few years so she doesn't have the extra cash to pay for insurance that would cover her as well.
