Oh Paul, bless his heart, he hasnâ€™t figured it out yet. He thinks the maga movement is Trump, and ridding the party of Trump will fix it. Paul my boy, the maga base IS the party. All the conservative mumbo jumbo, the old guy with a pipe by the fire stuff, it was all a bit. Pretend play acting. It was never real. Sorry you thought it was Paul, but this is the true face of conservatism revealed, the same racist hate fueled religious zealotry that hid itself behind a guise of conservative ideals after the civil rights movement. it has just reverted to OG form, and it aint goin away until they lose too much to have power or destroy the party again.

I think what this person is trying to say, and I agree with them on, is if Trump had actually won outright, he would have been exposed as a fraud and a loser in a second term, given that his economic policy would have had time to catch up with him, and the Republican Party itself would have lost a lot of power, except perhaps in the judiciary wing. Trump would have had an even more unfavorable second term than W, given our current economic climate and the war in Ukraine, and might have even managed to get himself impeached AGAIN and removed from office if Dems had managed to take both chambers of Congress in these midterms, which almost certainly would have happened with him in office and Roe overturned.
No, no... This is the Ayn Rand fanboi Ryan taking on his bestest Dagny Taggert role opposite Trump, the would-be John Galt. Except this Galt is inexplicably more of a loser than even the one in the book.
