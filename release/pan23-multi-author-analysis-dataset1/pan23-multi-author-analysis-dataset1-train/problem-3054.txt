I'm not sure about that. I remember when the debt hit 1 trillion around 1990 and there were predictions that Social Security and medicare would be backrupt by 2000 and the US in general would be bankrupt by that point. It never happened. I'm not saying our debt is irrelevant, but it is not a priority to eliminate it. It is impirtant to keep an adequate debt to gdp ratio though.
National debt is not like a credit card. It will likely always exist. It is much more important that the US remains a strong and stable power than lowering the debt. As long as that happens, our economy will be fine in the long run.
Well, you’re wrong about the Alex Jones part but you’re definitely right about the fact that there is a new world order, every single president since JFK has used the term prior to the advancement of any mass surveillance programs like the patriot act or major conflicts like we saw across the Middle East with multiple presidencies. America is still an empire with dreams of maximum control.
