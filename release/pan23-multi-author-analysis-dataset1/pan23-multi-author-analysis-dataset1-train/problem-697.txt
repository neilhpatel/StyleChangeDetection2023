The quick answer is that the average american probably did not have much perception of Buddhism other than it was some sort of enigmatic asian religion that involved monks and statues of its founder and perhaps a general sense that Zen Buddhism entailed a relaxed "go with the flow" mentality. That said, for a subset of the culture, there was intense interest in and engagement with Buddhism. Especially Zen Buddhism.
I’m not sure what metric is being used here for ‘some [of the first]’ but I think this might be at best rather misleading? There was quite a lot of Western scholarship on Buddhism more than twice as long ago: Eugene Burnouf and Christian Lassen wrote detailed treatises on it in the 1820s... colonial officials in India, Burma and Indochina were expected to know a lot of the basics. Schopenhauer was immensely influenced by Buddhist thought as well, and linguists had already published detailed grammars of Pali and translations of some key texts in English, French and German. I would estimate that a fairly educated Westerner of the late 19th century would be expected to have some inkling of Buddhism and who Buddha was. There was even a Western Buddhist monk in the late 19th century, who went by Dhammaloka.
