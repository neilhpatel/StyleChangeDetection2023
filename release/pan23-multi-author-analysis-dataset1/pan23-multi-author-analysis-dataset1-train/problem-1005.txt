This. It's all made up bullshit. It's betting. Like betting which horse will win the race. They think x company will go up so they buy it, which inflates the price bc now people want it and there's less stocks to buy. Or they sell off stock bc they think a company will lose based off of s news article. Money is such a man made problem. We're all fucked.
before amyone starts singing Les Miserables, please review a history book and realize that the French Revolution started with taxes on the wealthy to refill the royal coffers, and ended with the poor and middle class rebelling at the King stationing troops around the country to protect against the rich.
No it won't. A unstable political regime will crash the economy and make things worse. You can only take out the rich people and feel better. Heck, you probably cannot even do that, as they will just fly to another place if there is a revolution in the UK.
Exactly. I'd venture to bet that there is a disproportionate amount of older people tapping into savings in this because that's what people do when they retire.
