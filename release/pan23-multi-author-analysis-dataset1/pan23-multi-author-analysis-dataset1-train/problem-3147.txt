Third, there is "proper" technique imposed by society. For example, it might be considered not proper to kick the opponent in the groin, to grapple during a sword fight, to grab the opponent's blade, throwing one's sword, etc., even if these techniques are taught by a particular school and are effective. Even in a "no real rules" fight, expectations such as these can matter - winning a duel about honour through dishonourable means can be a pointless victory, and even if any means of victory is OK in a fight, expectations of "proper" affect training, and a fighter might, through habit, stick to "proper" technique.
And yeah they are pretty isolated. Without going too much into the boring details, my story has the 500 people at the start, and then a slow trickle of people being added (lets say.. 2-5 a day). I was thinking about “starting” the story say... 10-ish years after the 500, but I’m not set on that number yet. Maybe I’ll make one of the 500 or people added afterwords have some former experience...? I assume that would help?
Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you're asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don't know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in-depth or highly plot-reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.
