It will only impact you if he has children with his previous wife, and was ordered to pay child support to her. Generally previously ordered child support is deducted from income when calculating new child support payments, so all things being equal the first children to file earn more.
I would do it ASAP. If his wife finds out and files for divorce (and possibly also child support for her kids) before you are awarded child support, then the court may award your child less support. It’s often advantageous to be the “first one” to get a child support order against someone. Even if it gets modified later based on his new post-divorce financials, that will be an uphill battle for him and you’ll get that extra $ in the meantime.
Not automatically, no. He’d have to petition for a modification of the child support order based on a material change in circumstance (change in number of days in which he had custody). Of course, if they are fully back together and sharing finances, it is a bit silly to pay money to CSE and have the deposit the money back into the same account, so most people would file for an amendment. But there is a range of “back together” which include him still living in his own place and just hooking up with his ex on occasion.
