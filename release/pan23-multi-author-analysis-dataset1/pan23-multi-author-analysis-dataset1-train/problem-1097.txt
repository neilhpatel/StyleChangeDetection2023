As with All's Well, Shakespeare is in general pretty faithful to the settings of his sources even when they are not Italy or England. (Hamlet perhaps being the most famous example.).
Considering the way theatre was seen in the Elizabethan and Stuart era (to whit: very poorly; with the playhouses (especially after 1595) being located in the heart of the red light distract (in the case of The Rose, The Swan, and The Globe theatres) or in a part of London famed for being seen as run by criminals (Blackfriars- it gained its reputation after Henry VIII dissolved the Dominican friary who owned the region, selling the land to various landlords, but never updating the by-laws in the region; as such Blackfriars was under Church Law but with no church to enforce it; thus it became widely accepted that all warrants for any criminal could not be extended into Blackfriars; hence its reputation of criminality and its nickname to Londoners at the time, Alsace, after the contested region of France).
It's not the end of the story, because adapters have choices. But the bulk of the reason for the various Italian city-states' setting of Shakespeare's plays is most likely his sources. Good old Will took a lot of his source material from Italian literature, especially Boccaccio's Decameron. A lot of these texts are actually medieval, not "Renaissance," by basically every stretch of the imagination.
