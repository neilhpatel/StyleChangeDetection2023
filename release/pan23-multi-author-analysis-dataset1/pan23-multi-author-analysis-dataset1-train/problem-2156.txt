I think that's probably an easy assumption to make there Sherlock. .. I'm just giving you a hard time, but the head of state having top tier, specially trained security goes without saying. That's the case for pretty much every country on earth.
A few Russian political organizations took credit. US Intel said it was Ukraine, Russia agreed. Generally accepted that the target was her father. She was also going to be in the car with him. So Ukraine special forces accepted killing the daughter of a Putin supporter as collateral damage. Then only got his daughter.
TBH: with the way Putin and his cronies absolute crapped the bed with the way the war is running right now (logistic/tactics, etc), do the West/Ukraine risk killing/assassinate Putin and have someone that actually know how to fight a war (or someone that's more psychotic like the Wegner head Pugoshin) get into the position of power and make the war worse/longer? There's a reason why Sun Tzi said don't interrupt your enemy while they're making mistakes.
