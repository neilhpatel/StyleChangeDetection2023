The parole and exchange system in the Civil War is fascinating. During the middle of the war, the US and CSA had a formal arrangement called the Dix-Hill cartel that allowed for the quick parole of soldiers on the promise that they would not fight again until they were formally exchanged. It seems crazy to us that you'd release an enemy soldier on his promise not to fight, but both sides seemed to uphold the agreement pretty well.
Sometimes, after battles, officers would agree to exchange wounded POWs so that they would be treated by surgeons from their own side.
Surrendered soldiers generally got the same medical treatment that other soldiers did -- surgeons as a rule saw their obligation to treat the wounded regardless of who they fought for.
Compared to other CWs, surrender was much more common in the ACW, largely because officers and soldiers expected to be treated well afterwards. In other CWs, it was common for POWs to be executed as traitors (results vary depending on which cw we're talking about), but the American Civil War was really unusual for how often and how prominent surrender was.
Hi! Thanks for being here and answering our questions. Speaking of which, and this might be a gimme, but how did the South's policies influence the attitudes of black Union soldiers and civilians regarding surrender?
