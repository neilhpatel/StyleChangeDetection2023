In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yep. And nor is it the opinion of the constitution that those who incite a coup or attack the US should be barred from seeking positions of governance. Thatâ€™s flat out in there.

Exactly. Trump was exciting. All the fraud. Constitutional violations. Every day, another moronic tweet to laugh at. Coup attempts. Death threats. Graft. Grift. Treason. A thrill a minute. This new boring competent guy is a snore.
Well-off liberals who dismiss the worsening economic conditions for those outside their social circles as just being right wing gripes or the concerns of the ignorant inherently offer no viable alternative to the populist appeals of fascism which allows it to develop as a movement. When the fascist takeover is completed these same people will wholeheartedly go along with it to keep their status and the flow of treats they're accustomed to.
