company name was not mentioned. it was a general explanation of these products and what can go wrong with them. these products are widely discussed by consumers, there are countless Facebook groups and Reddits where users are trying to figure out what is going on with their malfunctioning product. My post was basically, "here's what you need to look at on your product to know it's made correctly", "here are the common problems your product could have", here is how to navigate the support channels to get help. No product names. no company names, no identifying information.
I'm not going to analyze the strenh of your case. That's a job for someone with a full knowledge of the facts who is knowledgeable about law in your jurisdiction. And preferably getting paid.
This is more of a reddit policy question than a legal one, but I did a cursory reading of PART of the policies and I get the impression that they only disclose user information to law enforcement and government agencies after careful review.
