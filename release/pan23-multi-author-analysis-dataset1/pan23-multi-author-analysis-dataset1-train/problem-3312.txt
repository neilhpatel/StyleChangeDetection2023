In the Anglophone humanities disciplines, "theory" tends to mean "critical theory" (Foucault, Derrida, Benjamin, Heidegger, etc.) whereas "philosophy" tends to designate other themes (but can include White, Hegel, what have you). Of course the critical theorists are (continental) philosophers themselves, so in principle you could lump the entire thing under "philosophy," but in practice the key difference is that someone who does "historical theory" is going to be trying to tell historical stories _in light of_ critical theory, whereas someone talking about philosophy of history is going to be talking about history as a practice through a philosophical bent.
E.g.: If I were to state "Husserl was a continental philosopher", most Husserl scholars (like my mentor) would roll their eyes and move on. It's 1. anachronistic and 2. in direct contradiction with Husserl's philosophical ambitions (Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft).
Then, the distinction is kinda analytical/critical and continental/speculative philosophy if I understand correctly.
It \irritates\ me that a lot of people \talk\ about Heidegger without being familiar with his texts.
