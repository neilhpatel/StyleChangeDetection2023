They way it works is that countries that are affected by this ban already don't buy Russian oil due to separate sanctions, and it primarily affects using Western services that would have to comply with price caps on deliveries elsewhere. At most West loses some service revenue.
Refusing service and declaring you will buy something a price you pick are different things, the market picks the prices in a free market which I thought as being a real liberal I would have support over things like free speech freedom of choice freedom of speech but people’s hatred of everything these days blinds them to making rational decisions.
I’m in Alberta Canada. The 4th biggest proven oil reserves are about a 5hour drive away. And that proven oil reserve is only 65% of Canada’s oil.
This Russian ban also isn't actually enacted yet (only posted) as it only comes active in February after Russian Government produces required supporting documents.
This might come as an absolute shock to you. But real life isn't a video game, production takes time to ramp up, and for the last year that is exactly what the west has been doing.
