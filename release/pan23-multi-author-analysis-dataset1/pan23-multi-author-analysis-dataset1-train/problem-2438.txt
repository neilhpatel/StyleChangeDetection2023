The individual was involved in the disappearance of my brothers wife and kids. This happened over a month ago. When it happened and we didn’t know where my nieces were.. my entire family was posting on Facebook for help in finding them. We knew she was involved so I messaged her. I have no idea who this lady is. And I don’t care. I messaged her at the time of the incident saying that she was an accessory to kidnapping. Because I had no idea what was going on at the time. I made a post that was not threatening but did say that she helped abduct my nieces with my sister in-law. The post was up for maybe a couple hours before I deleted it after I found out what was going on. Before that I had messaged her as stated all of 3 times. I said good luck with your life, meaning I didn’t agree with her decisions and thought she was doing wrong. I then said see you in court. Meaning the possibility that she was in the wrong here. Mind you I have no idea who she is where she lives, I know nothing about her. I don’t believe anything I said was threatening and I am completely not a threat and have not been harassing her. She filed this yesterday when the incident happened on Dec. 19th. If I was harassing her would t I have still been doing it for the past month? I blocked her on Facebook and have no future of talking to her or having anything to do with her ever again. Haven’t even thought about her in over a month..
Given - not the facts, whatever they are - but how you presented them in this thread, my advice (from a non-lawyer) is that you really need to get a lawyer to represent you properly, and present your side of the situation correctly and completely.
Yes that was a stupid thing to say. I was not implying that I would be taking her to court. I’m saying I would SEE her in court as in part of a trial.
