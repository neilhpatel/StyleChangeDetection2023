3. 黑 is an interesting example. One folk etymology is that it's fire (灬) under some kindling (土) with a box holding wood to be made into charcoal. But if you look at the earlier forms, it's pretty clearly a human with a giant marked head. I can't say what connotations the word may have had centuries ago, but a facial tattoo punishment certainly could carry different connotations to charcoal. Not that you'd know for how 黑 is used in compounds today.
Can someone direct me to examples of attempts from history to liberate concentration camps/detention centers/prisons/etc. by outside forces, other than in the context of WWII? Any time period is fine.
Briefly I want to establish that 1) Ricci unwittingly confirms distinctions between schools that would not have existed in the Confucian mind prior to the Han but 2a) Ricci isn't completely off the hook because even after the Han, the schools continued to use the same base vocabulary, albeit with different connotations and also because 2b) , Ricci mistakenly believed the boundaries between the schools were clearer than they actually were even as late as the Ming dynasty. This set up centuries of misunderstanding between Chinese and Western during religious dialogue because it helped create the "myth" of China's "four schools" of Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, and Legalism.
I want to give her a present of sorts (hopefully before this Christmas!) in so far as honoring her family by contracting the services of someone to formally compile and organize the documents my mom has, interview her, and write a comprehensive family history.
3. Did the evolution of the script change the connotations of a word's meaning (source especially appreciated here).
