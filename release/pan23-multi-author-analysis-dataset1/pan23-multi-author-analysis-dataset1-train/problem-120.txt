Next, document every encounter with date, time, place and content. Forward all information immediately to trusted family/friends and the police.
Have your service provider change your phone number, this can be done at no cost to you. Limit who receives this number to who needs it. Inform people who receive your new number not to give it out. Back up important files, then factory reset your phone. Use a password/PIN lock on your phone. Don't let other people handle your phone.
another thing I suggest and it's up to you and how comfortable you feel about it is to bait them with photos/things you don't really care if they got out just to see where are they getting your personal data from, for example: take a photo on your phone and put a different photo on your computer and depending on what they send, you can find out which source they're getting your personal data from.
This is my worst nightmare. Iâ€™m so sorry this is happening to you. Are they contacting you on social media? Or purely by your cellphone?
