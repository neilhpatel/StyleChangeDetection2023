Doing this yourself, without an attorney, is foolhardy. Notarization has no magical powers and will not protect you. Your insurance company will.
You have insurance (at least you'd better). She calls your insurance company, files a claim, they handle it and get a legal release from her that guarantees you won't see a lawsuit later. Her deductibles on her insurance are completely irrelevant.
Okay. She already has my insurance info I texted her a copy of the ID card. I’ll send her that text right now letting her I changed my mind. Thank you.
Ideally in an accident you wouldn't admit liability, but if you were at fault you might offer or agree to a set amount of compensation in settlement of and for a full release of any actual or potential claims. The settlement agreement often doesn't mention either party's liability at all.
Well. One more follow up actually. I do know of 2 attorneys I could speak to tomorrow am, I’m pretty close with both of them. Would it hurt for me to wait and talk to them tomorrow and see if they can possibly help me draft a release of liability?
