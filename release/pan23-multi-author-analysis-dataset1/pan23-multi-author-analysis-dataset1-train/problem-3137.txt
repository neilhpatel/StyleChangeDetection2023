My tin foil hat vibrates a bit when it comes to many of the individual elections. I have a feeling there's some secret club in Congress where, once you reach a certain level (not sure what the qualifications are exactly, but I'm guessing there is some degree of shamelessness and fundraising capabilities), you can dictate whether or not you wish to remain in Congress on your own, regardless of whatever the election outcome is, then people in the right places pull the right strings to make it happen.
Good for him. I thought his covid policies were a case of him doing what he believed was right knowing it would cost him reelection. Heâ€™s exceeded my expectations entirely.
The map at that link is really telling. The most poverty-stricken states are all in the south, plus KY and WV. Possibly the biggest tell is the difference between next door neighbora VA and WV. VA in the top 10 lowest poverty rates while WV has the 7th highest. I wonder why.
He has an infinite budget, apparently, and the worst of the worst corporate interests backing him, so he could get away with putting up a bad Democrat candidate, even, (or blocking out any new and viable Republican ones, which doesn't seem so hard, especially considering his approval), which was the case last time. I don't buy the name recognition and seniority things on their own. It doesn't add up.
