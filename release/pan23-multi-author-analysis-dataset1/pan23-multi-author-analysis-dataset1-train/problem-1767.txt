To focus only on the Romans (as I tend to do), the answer is straightforward: they (typically) drank in moderation, and watered down their wine.
The usual estimate is that adult Romans consumed about a liter (that is, rough a quart) of wine every day. Since this equates to about 1 1/3 modern bottles of wine, you might assume that they constantly tipsy. By and large, however, they were not.
> All flag officers, and all persons in or belonging to His Majesty's ships or vessels of war, being guilty of profane oaths, cursings, execrations, drunkenness, uncleanness, or other scandalous actions, in derogation of God's honour, and corruption of good manners, shall incur such punishment as a court martial shall think fit to impose, and as the nature and degree of their offence shall deserve.
Oh Duh. That makes more sense. I should've figured that out myself. Now that you put it that way I feel a little dumb for not thinking of it. Thank you!
Beer was generally brewed and cattle were slaughtered in winter months, which affected the manning of a fleet (to sail in the summer, the ships and men necessary would have to be "established" the previous autumn, so that brewing/slaughtering could take place during the winter).
But of course. Some hungover Romans clung to garlands of freshly-cut ivy and myrtle. Others guzzled honey, chewed cabbage, or crunched almonds. Still others pressed amethysts to their skin, rolled in mud, or performed calisthenics.
