Reviewing the logs of CAP fighter losses at the Battle of Midway in Shattered Sword reveals that several Type 0 carrier fighters (commonly known as the Zero fighter) were lost during engagements with American aircraft attacking Kidō Butai. Fourteen Type 0s were shot down while on CAP duty, with probably the single greatest concentration of Japanese fighters lost during a running engagement with then Lieutenant Commander Jimmy Thach's section of fighters, where he utilised his newly developed "Thach Weave" combat manuver to great effect. Of the lost Japanese fighters, one Type 0 is listed as shot down by SBD dive bombers, flown by Warrant Officer Kodama Yoshimi off of Hiryū, shot down during an attack on Marine Corps flown SBDs operating from Midway. However, many Type 0s are also listed as having been shot down by generic American aircraft over the course of the major dive bomber attack on Kidō Butai from about 1006 to 1040 in the morning.
Absolutely. The Nakajima B5N2 torpedo bomber was probably still the best of its kind at the time of Midway. However, it was nearing the point of being a Devastator: too slow, too clumsy, and difficult to defend. It only carried only a flexible 7.7mm machine gun for its own protection, and nothing firing forward. It did have a combat range of 1000km, but all that fuel came with the obvious drawback of making the "Kate" a Molotov cocktail looking for a light.
