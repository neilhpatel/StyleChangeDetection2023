well, I had a long conversation with the manager today and I do believe they are evicting these people. The manager disclosed to me that they've been a problem tenant in numerous other ways and they want them out of here. I'm just trying to understand why it's taking them so long - is it incompetence? - and to try to get a sense of how long this might take (or at least, when they plan to file the actual eviction, at which point it depends on the court date, obviously).
Yeah, they've issued a 30 day notice at some point (won't tell me when), and when that's up they will file an eviction. I know covid slows things down, but I'm really hoping it doesn't take 6 months. Ugh.
If the tenants are claiming a covid hardship, It's unlikely anything will be done before the end of June when the eviction moratorium expires (assuming it isn't renewed again).
I agree you do! You pay just like they do. But unfortunately most (not all) complex’s don’t do much unless the tenet isn’t paying their bills. Unfortunately you just got to be right across the hall from an annoying and rude neighbor.
