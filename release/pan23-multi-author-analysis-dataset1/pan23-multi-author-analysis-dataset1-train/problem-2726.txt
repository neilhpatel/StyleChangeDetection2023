So why did these countries' economies implode? Essentially because a Union-wide production and distribution system completely in the late Soviet period, at a time when macroeconomic instability massively increased. To put it succinctly, the republics, asserting their sovereignty even before the 1991 collapse, retained control of products, resources and revenues, preferring to barter with other republics or regions and starving the central government of revenue (a gap which was filled by printing lots of money, causing massive inflation). The Soviet government’s budget deficit in 1991 exceeded 20% of GDP, foreign loans exploded to $56.5 billion, and the economy had declined by 6% in 1990 and would decline by a further 17% in the first nine months of 1991. Inflation was running at 250%. The former Soviet republics didn't even fully disentangle their monetary systems until 1993, when Russia retired Soviet ruble notes and ended its connection with the former Soviet "ruble zone". All republics had major issues of state budgets spending vast amounts on subsidies to largely non-performing industries and having twin issues of inflation and economic decline.
thank you for this. Very cool answer. Like I said above, I find it very plausible that a significant amount of Ukraine's GDP is still a shadow economy, since the average salary isn't high yet I saw a lot of people with iPhone X and Apple Watch on the Kiev subway.
3. This lack of structural reform placed the Ukraninan government budget under massive pressure, and with limited ability to raise taxes, it resorted to inflation. This led to ....
I was a bit confused on how much defence spending could have fallen to account for such a huge amount of GDP But going from 5 million to 1 million service members alone seems like a huge difference to me.
