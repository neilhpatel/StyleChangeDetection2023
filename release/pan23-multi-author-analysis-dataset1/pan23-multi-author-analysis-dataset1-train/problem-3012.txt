I agree completely. Mods make it great, but let me also say that this community gives me constant reminders that there are people who want to learn, are flexible in their beliefs, and who are kind and appreciative of others. It is absolutely a place to restore faith in humanity.
Unpopular opinion. I don't like this subreddit at all. I get all excited about a subject, and even check ... 60 comments. Open it up. Nothing. Comment deleted. Comment deleted. Of 20 posts on this subreddit, 1 might have a response good enough.
Seriously. I know of multiple times that I have had conversations on other subs and thought...I shouldnâ€™t post that. I would be embarrassed if someone from askhistorians saw the way I was stating x, y, or z. I should be more kind and appropriate, even with those with whom I disagree.
Interesting. For me, this subreddit (and similar forums with strictly enforced rules) are reminders to me about why anarchy doesn't work. If you let the mob police itself, you end up with things like the old default subreddits (e.g., r/pics).
