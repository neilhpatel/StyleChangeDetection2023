Attorney's fees paid for by the losing side is something that happens in certain situations and lawsuits.
And a lawyer not taking a fee unless you win is called contingency, whereas having your attorney fees paid by the opposing side is something else. Two completely different legal concepts.
I'm in Ohio they are in Pa. The Kia rep told me to pay to fix it and submit it to the settlement folks and they may reimburse from the kindness of their hearts. lol.
Without knowing a single thing about your lawsuit (or your location), it's impossible to tell whether getting your attorney fees paid by the opposing side is even an option.
I agree. I think maybe I just need to find a local shop instead of a dealership to do it. I still don’t understand why they would only partially fix the problem and return it to me in an unsafe state. Maybe I should sue the dealership that swapped out the engine for ultimately not test driving it enough at the right speeds to get it to try and shift and not finding the problem. It’s frustrating.
