So, first Portugal and then Spain, which developed strong navies in the Western Mediterranean in the late 1400s, decided to try going around Africa to reach India on their own--not, as the story often goes, to try to restart the trade or free it up--but to try to cut the Ottoman/Genoese/Venetian trading block off and get a piece of the pie for themselves.
I just want to stress out something that /u/khowaga maybe didn't make clear. The vast majority of the trade and goods coming from Asia went via Egypt and Syria. And those weren't controlled by Ottomans until 1517 - a quarter century after Columbus and two decades after Vasco Da Gama. I go at great lenhs about it in my comments linked by /u/DanKensinon.
Most of the European trading houses were already doing business with the Ottomans before the fall of Constantinople, as the Ottomans controlled most of the ports elsewhere in Asia Minor along the Aegean, and were also making a hefty profit off of facilitating the trade This is one of the things about the "the Ottomans cut off the supply" argument that's non-sensical -- part of the reason they wanted to dominate was to control the trade and make money off of the taxes that they collected from it. Providing safe routes for traders coming in from the east was hugely important to them -- you can still see the caravanserais (inns) along the old trade routes throughout modern Turkey that the Ottoman state built to keep traders and their goods safe.
