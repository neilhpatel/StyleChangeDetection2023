From 1808 onward, the Royal Navy was empowered to overtake and capture ships in the Atlantic with slaves on board, returning any slaves captured in the process to West Africa, most frequently Freetown in Sierra Leone but also as the 19th Century went on, to St. Helena, Cape Town, Lagos and other British-controlled ports in West Africa.
>"It can be done. Clonfert and his black pilot know these waters perfectly. Look, here is the Jacotet anchorage just at hand, where he cut out the American. Yes, they should manage it well enough; though of course it must be done by boats and in the night; ships could not stand in against that fire, without being sadly mauled.".
Also, in HMS Surprise it is often mentioned that the frigate Lively, during her time in the Pacific, had obtained several Chinese crew members and several more Malays, who were very probably pirates but who had since settled down and become model crew members, and who are in fact selected for by Aubrey for a very dangerous covert mission into an enemy-held town because nobody would take them for Englishmen.
Thanks for this. I was not certain about the specifics of the scene in The Commodore described by the OP, but this sounds right in terms of how O'Brian writes Aubrey in the books.
As the OP says, in this case, there's some of O'Brian's usual work to reference the historical backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars.
