I just did a quick google search to aid in my answer. It appears your heat season is October 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021. Between 6AM - 10PM and if the temperature is below 55 degrees, it appears they have to keep the space at least 68 degrees. Because of this, begin documenting the weather each day and then begin documenting the temperature in your apartment. If you notice it is below 55 degrees outside and your apartment temp is below 68 between 6 and 10 pm, tell your landlord and instruct them to fix it. If they refuse/don't turn it up, document it and keep asking throughout the day. Keep documenting it. Next, it appears that it has to be at least 62 degrees inside between 10pm and 6am regardless of what the temp outside is. Do the same type of documentation type thing for this.
But you are correct that a tenant of an un-permitted unit may not be best advised to withhold rent for that reason alone; the lack of a permit may not be at all deleterious to a tenant and is an issue between the landlord and the jurisdiction's building department or housing authority.
Just to add to this. This could be construed as constructive eviction. I would find a new place and move. demand your deposit back + cost of moving...
