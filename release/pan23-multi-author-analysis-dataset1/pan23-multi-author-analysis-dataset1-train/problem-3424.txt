For the attorney handling your malpractice suit aganist your CPA: Ask for blood, depending on the facts and circumstances. Also, your malpractice attorney might want to talk with your bank-dispute attorney.
So, your next task is to consult with an attorney that specializes in malpractice, against CPAs and similar recordkeepers. As someone who works in litigation, and in financial analysis (former pension actuary) I would guess that professional requirements for a CPA generally include not disclosing client information unless required by authority.
IANAL. I am a licensed CPA. The only time a CPA may disclose a client's confidential records are pursuant to a lawful subpoena or as part of a Quality Assurance review by another firm, which is bound by the same confidentiality.
The CPA should have recused himself from any participation in the bank board's deliberations, and should not have supplied his client's confidential information to the bank.
u/bastionfour is absolutely correct. But I can at least provide some unprofessional questions you should answer for yourself based on your facts above. Maybe they will help you with a cost/benefit analysis.
