Well yeah, but a Patriot system costs $1billion per system, while the S-300 is only $150million. So you can have 6 S-300 systems for the price of one Patriot.... That's not to mention that each Patriot missile costs $4 million per shot.
Another point to make, is that the Patriot system costs 1billion per system, while an S-400 system is only 300million, with the S-300 only costing 150million... The cost benefit analysis heavily favors the Russian systems.
Peace was tried. Russia wants to keep the territories they’ve invaded and illegitimately annexed. As you can imagine, that peace “deal” wasn’t popular in Ukraine. The war goes on.
Russia and US talk to each other, be it back channels or regular channels, and even if they dont talk to each other, they spend a lot of $ spying each other, Russia has spies all over the US and US has spies all over Russia, people with power within the government, they know what the other is up to, dont believe me? just watch the facts, US knew every step Russia was going to make even before their own people and im talking about people at high places, Russia has invested a lot of money buying politicians all over the world including the US (we'll leave their names off to avoid D's vs R's chitchat), both of them are able to spy from above (satellites) and so does their allies.
