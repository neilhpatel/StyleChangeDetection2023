I don't know whether an answer of this nature is accepted, so please feel free to remove it if it is off-topic, but I feel that more people should know about Manuela Saenz, a legendary and brave South American woman who led an exceptional life that ended on a tragic note.
Once in Berlin, the two resume their love affair. One afternoon, on a trip to Berlin Zoo, Lahousen warns Bihet-Richou that Hitler is planning to invade Czechoslovakia the following March, and that if Britain and France make a stand, he is willing to go to war. Bihet-Richou rushes straight back to Paris to make her report, and this information ends up on the desk of the Foreign Minister. Another report closer to the invasion goes unheeded. In 1939, with the clouds of war gathering, Bihet-Richou leaves Berlin to visit her son, who is critically ill in Hospital. She does not get the chance to return before Germany invades Poland.
Aboriginal people remember her as having a courageous spirit and endless ingenuity and determination.
Bona resolved to march on Genoa. It is unclear if she was wholly aware of the kind of risks this decision entailed, emptying the city of Milan of loyal soldiery and straining the Duchy's finances. But what is unmistakable is that it was the umpteenth bold move on her part. Bona's formative years, split between classical education and the rugged lifestyle of the alpine highlands, culminating with a period in the French court in Paris, had produced a woman much more cunning than her rivals ever expected. Ottaviano Sforza had drowned while fleeing Milan, while Sforza Maria Sforza had been poisoned by her agents. Just enough persuasion would have been enough to convince the King of Naples not to deliver Sforza Maria's fief to Ludovico, and thus cut off her last rival from any source of income (for he certainly could not return to his fiefs in Lombardy). At the end of her two years of regency, she was inches away from crushing all her rivals.
