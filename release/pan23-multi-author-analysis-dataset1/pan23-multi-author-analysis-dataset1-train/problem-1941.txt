I frankly think that the role of the KPD has been overstated in the past when it comes to the actual end of the republic. The KPD during these years embraced a strategy of shunning the Social Democrats under a doctrine of "social fascism", claiming the SPD would be the main promulgator of fascism. This was heavily influenced not just by the Soviet policy of the time but also the deep running antagonism between SPD and more left groups since the SPD's failurte to embrace council democracy in 1919.
Not really. Actually, under Raymond Poincar√®s term of 1922 to 1924, France tried to heavily undermine the republic of Weimar, even to the point where they instigated an unsuccessful "rebel movement" in October/November of 1923 with the goal that the Rhineland became an independent, France-leaning state.
I have a sort of meta question I guess. You must be aware of the parallels that could be made between your write up here and the very recent political history of the United States. Even as someone with a political orientation that would lead me to make comparisons between modern right-wing politics and early 20th century German right-wing politics, it makes me somewhat skeptical that you might be focusing on certain aspects or telling the story in a certain way to intentionally invite those comparisons, possibly leaving out other things.
No, not really. The SPD represented Social Democracy to democratic socialism and was ideologically and politically opposed to the communists. They had been invovled in government with several parties that later supported Streicher und Papen. It was just that a program of social democracy was not something the German conservative elites was ready to accept, even in small bits.
