Title: Cited a marked lanes violation and operating to endanger for swerving and crashing my car to miss a deer. (18M).
Haha, no sorry not loss of control/qualifying trigger as in psychological defense element Loss of Control, I meant loss of control of your vehicle. My apologies for not using precise language. For example in many statutes it's called Failure to Control or Operating Without Reasonable Control. It's not getting off with charges dismissed but it's often a way a Lawyer can negotiate an outcome that's a step down from reckless/dangerous/negligent operation.
If it gives you any hope this Charge actually gets dismissed and reduced quite frequently in single car accident cases like(I can see the lane change sticking, although).
Yup, Massachusetts. And yeah, were looking into a lawyer. Really pissed they decided to go about this as a criminal charge it was really fucking unnecessary. But then again I live in a small town and there's nothing better for the cops to do than this shit so oh well.
