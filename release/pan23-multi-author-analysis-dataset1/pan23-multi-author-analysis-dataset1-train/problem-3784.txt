While this isn't perhaps the idea you had in mind, I'm going to focus on one specific aspect of anti-miscegenation laws that were probably most disproportionately applied with gender in mind, namely white men who had married women that legally speaking were not "white" as defined by the race laws of the time, or even might be construed as not doing so, given how such laws of the period were written. This wasn't a situation of the state pursuing the couple though, but rather the husband using this information to seek the dissolution of his marriage in a time when divorce was rare and allowed in only a few narrow circumstances.
This part stood out to me. Was this wording based on an ignorance at the time of Mexican indigenous peoples' existence, or the presumption that there had been no mixing between them and the Spanish colonists? How separate were the full-Mexican, mixed, and full-Spanish populations in Mexico at the time?
Absolutely. I would refer back to the Ferrall case and the judge's admonition that Frank was seeking to leave his marriage in a way:
Wonderful answer. As a follow up, were there anti-miscegenation laws barring marriage between whites and east Indians? Or Malaysians, Indonesians, etc? i.e., south asians who def could not pass as white but were decidedly non-African.

This is how state courts are supposed to function when dealing with Federal constitutional issues - state courts do not have discretion to overturn or even examine Federal precedent, they just have to blindly apply it when a Federal question comes before them.
Because the issue in question was the law's Federal constitutionality, the Arizona Supreme Court had no discretion to make their own determination as to its constitutionality. Instead, they applied the current Federal law on the subject, which was that anti-miscegenation laws were constitutional.
