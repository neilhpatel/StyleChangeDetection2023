Thanks for all this info, I have been in touch with the insurance representative of my employer and they are going to try two things, 1 - Send eob for denied claims and hope my wife's insurance agrees to pay as my son would then be only on her insurance and never double covered & 2 - Since the claims were resubmitted, relax the 90 days policy and process the claims themselves.
NAL . A lot of insurance plans will cover x days post birth on the mothers by default NOT because they wee added. Double check your wives policy on this. Also check pay deductions. Did either of you pay for a plus 1. If so make sure to bring that up. ( ie took payment therefore expected to be in good standing ). Also check what state your plans are registered to . Are both your plans virgina ( several states I worked in had my plan manged out of state due to head quarters) Of the 4 states I worked in none had the default birthday rule, though individual companies would require it. If it is a company specific policy and not a State policy you may have an easier time covering the time.
