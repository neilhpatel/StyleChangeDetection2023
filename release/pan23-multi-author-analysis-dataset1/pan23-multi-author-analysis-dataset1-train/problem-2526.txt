One of the articles I read had scans of all the checks. The signatures are all different but the rest of the writing is more similar, like it was intentionally trying to write different signatures. And like half the checks all had "Puppies" written in the memo section, which is odd enough they all used the same wording but the writing is similar (e.g. several of them had all capital Ps). I think some real analysis would show they were his hand, but I admit that is largely based off the fact that he's a compulsive liar. I think there was also evidence that he actually auctioned off puppies, despite saying he never purchased them.
And the puppies that he auctioned off around the same time have no relation with the puppies that were fraudulently purchased using his checks, that he knows nothing about. This is just the internet trying to slander his stellar reputation as an upstanding member of the community and US Representative.
I don't know about that. But I do know the ones I know actually love and care for their animals. Neighbor buddy of mine's horses get more attention than a lot of kids and they live in way cleaner conditions than most people.
