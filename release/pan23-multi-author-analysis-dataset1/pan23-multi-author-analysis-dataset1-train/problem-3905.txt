Courts may use earning potential for extremely low income non-custodial parents or non-custodial parents who are not employed at the time of the hearing.
Courts may also use financial disclosure statements and other sources to determine the income of a non-custodial parent for child support calculation.
Thank you for your response. I spoke with a lawyer who offered a free consultation. They said you have to wait a year to adjust the support awarded, and they advised me to fill out custody paperwork asap because once that is filed then they can actually change what each parent owes. They confirmed the numbers were put in correctly but there are lots of credits I should’ve used that wouldve got the money down several hundred dollars. So basically I am stuck with what I’m ordered until the custody case concludes which would be several months. 5k they want to retain them too. Baby momma who doesn’t have any living expenses at all is basically rubbing it all in my face like this is what i get. She’s keeping me from seeing them for more than two days a week and basically nothing I can do about that until court. Such a mess.
