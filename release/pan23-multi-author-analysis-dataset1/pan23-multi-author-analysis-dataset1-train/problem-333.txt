Yes the balloon was in the stratosphere which the low stratosphere all US fighter jets could reach. If it was in the high stratosphere (it wasn’t) I don’t think any plane could although I’m not sure we know the true flight ceiling of the F-22, when I googled it I got answers around 50-60k feet which is where the F-15 and 16 both fly.
Idk, I personally didn’t hear anything about that, for me that wouldn’t make sense because it’s just a balloon and F-22s need something like 17 man hours of maintenance for every hour of flight or some shit but it’s possible. If they did then I guess they could’ve used them.
it should have been shot down when it was over Alaska, honestly the way they dealt with this is quite shocking, a foreign craft flying over continental US, never in my life did i expect the US to react like this to such an event, as a european i think this is an ominous sign about how US will react in the future to russian/chinese severe violations of US/allied space.
Also, the weight. I don't think this balloon could carry the weight of a life support system and a crew.
And even then hot air balloons don't go that high and they would have to be up there for days with oxygen, food, and water.
