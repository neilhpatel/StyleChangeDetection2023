In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. Same with people who say “Want a better job? Up your skills.” Considering how high tuition and book/supply costs are, many can’t afford to take classes. Plus, how many of these people have 2-3 jobs? When can they take classes, or even watch YouTube videos?

It absolutely is medically necessary. If the “baby” has no chance of surviving birth, there is absolutely no ethical or logical reason to force the woman to carry to term. Pregnancy causes drastic changes to to the body that last for months after birth, and that’s not even considering all the various complications that can arise between now and then. If the fetus starts to rot, it can cause the woman to develop sepsis (blood poisoning) which is very difficult to treat once it progresses to the point of being noticeable and often results in death.
