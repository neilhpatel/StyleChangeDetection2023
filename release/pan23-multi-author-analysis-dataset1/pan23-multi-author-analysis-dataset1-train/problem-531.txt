People were absolutely aware that Mazovian aurochs are the last of their species. Jędrzej Święcicki have written in mid 16th century Topographia sive Masoviae descriptio (Topography or description of Mazovia, published in 1634), in this book he included one of the most valuable descriptions of aurochs:
All true. Bear in mind that some island colonization events with mammals lead to populations that flourish temporarily and later crap out after a few thousand years if they don't get new blood. I recall a paper a few years ago showing that the remnant mammoths on Wrangel Island had major genetic problems from inbreeding towards the end that would have doomed them one way or another. Cheetahs hit a nasty bottleneck ten thousand years ago and have rebounded in the short term but are sort of looking screwed genetically as time goes by. The fact that an inbred population flourishes temporarily doesn't mean it has a long-term future.
Biologist here. A genetic bottleneck isn’t great, but they absolutely could have propagated from 24 individuals. We have done that with Black-footed Ferrets, Whooping Cranes, and California Condors.
