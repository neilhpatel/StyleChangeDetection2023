This is why Southern Conservatives don't learn from their history. Because our focus on party names makes this discussion seem far more complicated than it needs to be. If Southern Conservatives had to consistently go by one name for their set of beliefs, they wouldn't have nearly the success they have with their hateful ideas today. But they get to call themselves "The Party of Lincoln", when it was the Southern Conservatives who went to war against him. It's absurd.
so instead of having two sides forced together and not getting anything done while they hate eachother, perhaps it's better if we let people form their own unions, do democracy with terms and states they generally agree with, and produce results which satisfy both types of people. conservatives deserve conservative gov't and leftists deserve to have leftist gov't. and if we had separate unions, I'm pretty sure that's what would happen. Not two USAs.
And yeah, Lincoln was elected by Northern Liberals and Progressives who called themselves Republicans, while Southern Conservatives were busy giving us the Confederacy.
3. Even if purple states slow the rate of divergence, they're not gonna stop them, so more divergence over time would make sense.
