So the question is: " was this the "wilding" of the early 18th century? Note that in the newspaper quote above, the writer speaks of "Pranks of the Mohocks" almost as a generic term from violence-- he gives no indications that this actually is a specific gang of that name, his account is equally consistent with the idea "'Mohocks' is the name we're giving young drunken disorderlies today". Note that the account itself states that despite the arrest of these individuals, more violence was subsequently committed-- either these aren't "all the Mohocks", or more logically this is just a name that's being applied to random drunken thuggery.
Thanks again! This is such an interesting topic. Are there any books about it that you could recommend?
The "Mohocks" are a bit like the social media frenzy over "Mo Mo", the Duke Lacrosse team or the Central Park "rapists" -- a hysteria that had some kernel of truth to it, but which was overwhelmed by drama and invention and a desire to over-hastily read into an ambiguous incident some list of perceived deviance in contemporary society.
