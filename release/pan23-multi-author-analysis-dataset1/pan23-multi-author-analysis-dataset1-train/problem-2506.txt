Here we are focused on what the law is. When I was in private practice if a teacher had come to me with these facts, which undoubtably are worse than you presented, because you likely tried to paint yourself in the best possible light, I absolutely would have filed a for a protective order.
I read your thread. I didn’t call her a stupid bitch, but she is teaching 200 students while mentally ill. She literally said she prays to the lesbian gay transgender bisexual queer flag. Prays to it, fucking prays to it. And replaced the national flag with it 😂. Want to know why most people don’t do that? Because it’s fucking insane. So I did essentially “show that bitch” by tracking her down, but NOT forcing her to take the flag. That’s where you are 100% wrong, i live 2000 miles away and have no control over what the bitch does with the flag. And once again since you’re clearly learning law from one of these goofs, sending a package, is, wait for it, not illegal, whether I used a database to find her address or not. I’m an edge lord indeed, because when these people grow in power they spread, and half the country will be bowing to a rainbow flag. I’ll be long gone in China by then, or Russia. Until then I’ll let YOU change the story and I’ll just sit and assume it’s correct because you’re in highschool political science. Tard.
