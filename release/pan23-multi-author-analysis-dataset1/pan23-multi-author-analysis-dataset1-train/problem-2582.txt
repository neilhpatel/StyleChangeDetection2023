It’s absolutely fair game to be critical of these beliefs, ESPECIALLY if they’re being used and espoused to further political goals and suppress peoples rights. Criticism of religion and criticism of horrid stuff committed by irreligious groups aren’t mutually exclusive.
No it doesn’t. Mind you, I’m not religious, but if “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her” is calling for oppression and violence, I’ll be damned.
While, yes I agree, I think the point the other commenter was making is more along the lines of: they claim to be religious but they don’t even properly follow the claimed religion by the sheer fact of their oppression and use of violence. It’s like saying Stalin was not a communist; while true, he did use that image to enforce his totalitarian dictatorship, much like Khameini today, and Khomeini before him, with Shia Islam.
I’m not trashing on them? I’m just saying there is heinous stuff in religious texts and some people use that heinous stuff as justification.
I get you but using one quote from one religion doesn’t prove the point against a tonne of the heinous stuff in lots of religious texts that people follow as fact.
