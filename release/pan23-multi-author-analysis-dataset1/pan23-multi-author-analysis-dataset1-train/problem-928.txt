Do you not understand what the word damage means? Using chalk on a sidewalk is not causing any damage. This isn’t make believe land where someone can come up with their own definition of the word damage. This would be the equivalent of a apartment complex trying to fine you for using a command hook on a wall claiming that you have damaged the wall even if it comes off without any damage to the paint. An apartment can not fine you for damages without the actual presence of damages. Nor can they fine you for something that they don’t directly prohibit. Using chalk on a side walk would not constitute damage and is therefore not prohibited unless directly stated in the lease. If this was allowed can you imagine what they could claim as damage? Literally under your idiotic reasoning you having mud on your shoes and walking on the sidewalk could be considered damages if we are letting the complex come up with their own definition of what damage is.
No, i'm not. how is sidewalk any worse than a welcome mat? if anything a welcome mat would be more likely than chalk to permanently alter the color of the pavement compared to the surrounding area.
