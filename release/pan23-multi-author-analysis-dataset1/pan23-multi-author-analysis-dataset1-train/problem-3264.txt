Should probably go after the doctors overprescribing as well. At the end of the day you need a valid prescription in the first place to get the opioid from a pharmacy.

No way Doctors can prescribe anything and everything they want It's up to pharmacists to examine the patient, determine if the patient needs the prescription, determine if the doctor has a pattern of overprescribing, determine if the doctor is writing prescriptions for fake patients, and then refuse to fill a pain medication for John who just got oral surgery because his doctor prescribed a suspicious amount of opioids to other patients!
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
