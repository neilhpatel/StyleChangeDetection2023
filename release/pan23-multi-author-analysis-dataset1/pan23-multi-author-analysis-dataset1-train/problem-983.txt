KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine spurned an offer from Russian President Vladimir Putin for a 36-hour ceasefire over Orthodox Christmas, saying there would be no truce until Russia withdraws its invading forces from occupied land.
Ukraine has previously dismissed the prospect of any Russian call for a ceasefire as an attempt by Moscow to secure some respite for its troops, which Ukraine is trying to force from territory Russia seized by force after its invasion last February.
Lol. Imagine if some intruder got into your house on Christmas eve. You fight the guy to protect your family and then it becomes 12AM Christmas Day. The burglar goes "hey man, lets stop hitting each other for a sec, its Christmas" then dude walks to your kitchen to grab a glass of water.
Exactly. Why should Ukraine allow an invading army within their borders any respite from the war when the country that army represents terror bombs civilian targets and kidnaps their children? If the Russian military wants to celebrate Christmas, they can simply go back to Russia and do so.
