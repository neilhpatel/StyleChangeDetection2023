This is a fun question because it is always intriguing to consider what might be missing in the ancient record. Key words here are "civilization," "akin," and "Bronze Age.".
Since "wagons", "riding", and "shepherding" all assume domesticated work animals, I guess there's a deeper question there: could a paleolithic civilization have domesticated work animals, relied on them, and then disappeared, with no surviving record of this early practice of domestication?
Thanks for this. /u/PapaFranz offered an excellent breakdown of the history of the term "civilization" in anthropological literature:
We might find a village or even a town. We might find a clay tablet covered with astronomical observations. We might find a child buried with a wolf pup, or a copper bracelet, or some other artifact seemingly out of time. But we are almost certainly never going to find any site where the feedback loop between this suite of innovations created a Bronze Age-equivalent society far outside our currently understood timelines.
