For those of you looking for a more "general history" book which is also a great way to get people interested in the past, I highly recommend E.H Gombrich's A Little History of the World. A bit old admittedly; 1936 when the first edition was published, though you can easily find newer ones with additional material by other historians included. This book was one of my first ones when I was starting out on history (and the name AskHistorians was about three years away from ever becoming a commonplace utterance of mine), but it is frankly an amazing work of story-telling which traces some of the general trends, civilisations, and progress that our societies have undergone in the past four millennia or so. I also rather like the minimalist design of the cover and the illustrations inside the work, so bonus points for aesthetic there. It's probably one of the few history books I could fall asleep reading, not because of how boring or argumentative it is, but simply by how it flows so well and reads like your old bedtime story (and since that story is based on true fact, all the better!).
Any books on proxy conflicts in the cold war, especially civil wars where both superpowers powered different rebel parties under ideological or material reasons? I'm new here and I'd love some recommendations thanks.
