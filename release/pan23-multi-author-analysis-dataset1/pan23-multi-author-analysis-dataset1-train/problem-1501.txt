The main issue is going to be the time frame involved; if your employer is able to address the issue and get their systems back up within a relatively short time, it's likely that the issue will be settled before any investigation has been completed or the DoL has compelled them to take any action. Still, even getting word that the DoL is investigating them might encourage your employer to be more proactive about implementing some interim solution to make sure employees are being paid properly, regardless of the cost, so it might actually be worth filing a claim (and encouraging your fellow employees who aren't being paid properly to file their own claims as well; receiving a large number of complaints at once regarding the same employer might encourage quicker action by your state's DoL...).
You have received reasonable advice via the posts of others. What I would suggest is to (today, ASAP) go to each of the 4 major credit bureaus and 1) pull your credit report (review it to make sure that nothing is out of sorts); and 2) put a freeze on your credit file. This is all free.
A ransomware attack doesn't absolve your employer of their responsibility to follow state and federal laws regarding pay. It's their responsibility to have redundancies in place to continue paying their employees as required by law. You should keep careful track of all of your hours worked and send those records to your manager on a regular basis (e.g. weekly), and also follow any alternative processes to log your time that your employer has implemented. If they know or should reasonably be aware of time you have worked, they are required by law to pay you for that time on your regular pay date.
