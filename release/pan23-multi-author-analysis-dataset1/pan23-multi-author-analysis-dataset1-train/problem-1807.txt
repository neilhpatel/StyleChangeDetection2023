Sorry, we don't allow "throughout history" questions. It's not that your question was bad; it's that these kinds of questions tend to produce threads that are collections of disjointed, partial, inadequate responses. If you have a question about a specific era, like "classical Americas" or "ancient and medieval Asia", feel free to rewrite your question and submit it again. If you don't want to rewrite it, you might try submitting it to /r/history, /r/askhistory, or /r/tellmeafact. I'd recommend /r/history for this one. .
I've been doing some reading and googling, and it seems that the TL;DR timeline is: first evidence of primitive trade around 17,000BC, first records of over sea trade around 3500BC between Egypt and Phoenicia (I assume animal-powered trade came before), then no "major" advancements until the steam-powered train in early 1800. That's when we get into the "modern" era, with the train followed by trucks (apparently there were steam-powered trucks first, that was impressive to learn about!), then airplanes.
