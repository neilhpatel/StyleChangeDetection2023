The planning for the invasion itself was somewhat rushed – Brigade 2506, the American-backed and trained group of Cuban anti-Castro exiles, had been training in Guatemala, but under pressure from its neighbours the Guatemalan government wanted the Cuban exile force to leave by April of 1961 to take the diplomatic pressure off of Guatemala City. This, combined with the logistical issues of landing a substantial number of troops (only about 1,500 landed at in April of 1961), presented severe constraints on the scale of the planned invasion. Furthermore, the top-secret planned invasion was not necessarily unknown by the Cuban community more generally – it’s said that in Miami, the invasion was a common topic of conversation in restaurants and bars. Because of this difficulty in obtaining deniability, American willingness to provide overt support was limited.
You mention that Kennedy felt misled by Dulles. The reading I've done on the Bay of Pigs suggests that the military/national security apparatus took advantage of the Eisenhower-to-Kennedy presidential transition by representing the operation to the incoming President as a slam-dunk, and also too far along to cancel without embarrassment for the U.S. The military effectively boxed-in Kennedy's options at the very beginning of his Presidency, a lesson he would remember during the Cuban Missile crisis that came later.
