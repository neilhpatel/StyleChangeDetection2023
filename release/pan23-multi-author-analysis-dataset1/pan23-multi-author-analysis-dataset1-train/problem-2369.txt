that's actually an awful way to put pressure on anyone, because putting pressure implies using something as leverage to get someone to act in a particular way, and they're literally eliminating the leverage... so yeah, i'd say there are better ways to put pressure one someone...
Both. Its both. We help Ukraine with money we steal from Russia by funding our own economies to assist in there rebuild while simultaneously full on capsizing the russian market. Meanwhile there is an even deeper foothold in the Ukranian market do to an influx of western brands from construction materials to cocacola. Soon enough the populous is as enfatuated with overprocessed-designed-for-the-dump-garbage as any stadard American is and full populist assimialation will be complete!
Don't think it's a silly take at all. Ukraine will not be built overnight and a lot of scavengers will come out of the woodwork setting up fake construction business looking to nick their share in the chaos of massive distribution of funds. Can you remember what happened in US with the PP loans?
The best solution IMHO for the people is to move them to somewhere with existing infrastructure ASAP, not scream through the newspapers how Russia needs to be disowned and devise weird schemes that of course will apply to that but not to any other war in the past or future and will likely worsen the situation socially and politically.
