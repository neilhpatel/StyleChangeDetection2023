The Reedy Creek Improvement District (Disneyâ€™s self-government) is basically the only example in the US of a private corporation actually building publicly accessible infrastructure at no cost to local taxpayers. Disney literally pays for it all themselves. But then if their self-government gets taken from them, they wonâ€™t have the ability to do this anymore and the state is gonna have to take over all of it, with the cost going to local taxpayers.

Disney has historically donated big to republicans. Corporations prefer fascism to democracy. It kind of allows them to do whatever they want without having to be held accountable.
