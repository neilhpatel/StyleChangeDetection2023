Incidentally, this "support" TV Rain wanted to give, misconstrued as sending physical items, was actually a chance of telling their stories. And again, only an idiot would prevent the soldier of an opposing force from giving a testimonial about how shit the condition they are in is. Leaving us with only the Russian government's story about how great everything is going for everyone. Good job.
For an reference, the law dictates that any official meeting with government officia or government issued paper must be in the official countries language-latvian.
Okay. Listen. You cannot give such message in a country where the population already has many russians that think russia is the best and never wrong. It’s war and you can’t help one side but also allow a message to send or suggest sending aid to the opponent. Latvians pay a proportionally huge sum for military aid to Ukraine and have a media that says “but let’s support the opposite side because they’re also victims”. How does that make any sense?
