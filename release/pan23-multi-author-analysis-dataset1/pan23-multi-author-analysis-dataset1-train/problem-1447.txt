They weren't testifying against your character. They were testifying as to your other counts, which the judge felt like it wasn't sufficient enough evidence to bring to the jury. There's a lot of other instructive jury charges that tell jurors what they should or shouldn't do. I've never been at trial or witnessed a trial where the judge didn't give them all that information at least once in his or her addressing the jury. Generally, we don't question the jury as to how they came up with verdict that they came up with. So, unless it was some majorly egregious jury instruction that if followed, the jury couldn't do their job properly, most of the time it's going to fly, even if an objection was made, the issue properly preserved for appeal, and actually appealed.
