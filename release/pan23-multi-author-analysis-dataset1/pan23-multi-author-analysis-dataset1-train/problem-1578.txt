Making a UM claim is an either or thing. You either file the claim with your insurance company OR you sue the driver. If you do both then the insurance company can potentially come after you to recoup whatever they paid out on the claim. You can sue and then make a UIM claim, but doing so is not something you should consider without talking to a non-tribal attorney.
You will need a tribal attorney to handle the case for you. Even if you're represented by a tribal attorney, your chances of getting a fair hearing are fairly low - but without a tribal attorney they are non-existent.
Yup makes sense. Not that this matters when the tribal court is stacked against “outsiders”. But she has 2 DUIs with most recent one in December 2020 where she was arrested for not only DUI but bypassing the interlock ignitition. This arrest happened by a non-tribal police department. Thank god.. My guess is she lost the drivers license then. Despite this, she wasn’t booked last night by the tribal police for driving without a license or insurance. My guess is they skipped on the breathalyzer test as well. It’s one thing to protect tribal members for minor infractions but it makes you wonder where this enabling ends. I guess tribal members really have zero accountability on the reservation. A truly unsafe place for all “outsiders”.
