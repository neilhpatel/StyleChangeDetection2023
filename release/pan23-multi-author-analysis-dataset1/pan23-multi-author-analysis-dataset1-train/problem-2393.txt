SIDEBAR: The Fox Network was--after many years of trying--the first successful attempt at creating a "fourth network" to rival NBC, ABC, and CBS. It was effectively a full syndicated network, and while the Fox shows were on in the evening blocks, the rest of the day was your standard syndicated talk shows, game shows, miscellaneous cartoons, old movies, et cetera. (I grew up in the suburbs of New York City; here NBC is Channel 4, ABC is Channel 7, and CBS is Channel 2. Channel 5 (WNYW) became "Fox5" in 1986. There were two other syndication channels, Channel 9 (WWOR) and Channel 11 (WPIX), which later became UPN and The WB respectively when those were launched in January of 1995. When those two syndicated networks merged into The CW, WPIX retained the programming. WWOR had--oddly enough--been purchased by NewsCorp in 2000 and run a combination of both UPN and Fox shows, despite Fox5 already existing. It later became home to another syndicated network, MyNetwork TV, which was kind of a disaster but technically still exists. Go fig.).
Akom production company was one of those studios, and itâ€™s interesting watching the show because you can pretty much tell which episodes were produced by Akom immediately, because the animation is noticeably worse. Akom ended up producing 12 of the episodes before WB cancelled their contract.
