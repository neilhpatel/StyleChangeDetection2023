The ruling party since the fall of Apartheid in South Africa is the ANC who received support from the Soviet Union in their struggle against the apartheid government so the party apparatus has close ties with the Russian state.
That's not how they started. The Taliban became relevant later, years after USSR wasn't a factor. They started concurrently, but not really relatedly, with Pakistan funneling US money, US money they were tasked with disbursing for general use against the USSR in Afghanistan and then US friendly forces after 1989, to fund the training and build influence of the Taliban fighters to bring Afghanistan under its sphere.
WTF. This hasn’t been done already and it’s been a year. What is the point of the UN if they can’t do anything. Why can’t they make decision with a majority like 75% of country agree if make a statement and send in troops and money and specialists. Why does everything they do seem to need 100%. Please correct me if I am wrong. I didn’t research anything.
