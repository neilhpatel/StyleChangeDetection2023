Dccc democratic Congressional campaign committee. It was one of those NY districts that they should have won but didn’t because again they fucked up. Looking where it is, there are a ton of small news outlets. It’s part of the nyc media network, which would be national. They could have destroyed him before the election and didn’t.

You'll notice that conservative media is currently demonizing fact-checking and trying to subvert the authority of experts while doing two things: first, flooding social media with a ton of minor actors repeating the claims they want to propagate and second, telling their viewers to 'do their own research' while also indicating that those minor actors are more reputable sources than the actual experts. Overwhelming common sense with volume, drowning out facts by repeating debunked claims over and over again.
