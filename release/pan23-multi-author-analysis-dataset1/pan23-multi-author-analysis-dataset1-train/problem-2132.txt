I recently picked up Douglas Boin's Alaric and have gotten about halfway through, and I am putting it here rather than in the book recommendation thread both because I want to write a longer review wen I finish it, but also because at the moment I am somewhat more interested in some of the meta issues around it than the book itself (which is quite good, to be clear). It roughly narrates "the beginning of the end"--the period from Adrianople to the Sack of Rome--with a focus on Goths in the empire and a thin veneer of a biography of Alaric, one of the most significant figures of the time.
So yeah. Alternate history Sicily is just kind of cursed. But we can't stop laughing about the crazy things happening.
History is the worst offender - virtually everything i was taught in school before college was false(even a good chunk of what i was taught in university was false too), and the majority of the public operates their whole lives on this false conception of history because they donâ€™t become historians. I recently saw a textbook belonging to a family members child that claimed people in England in 1066 would routinely rub their own feces on themselves to protect from disease, that they would deliberately poop in their water supplies and that British (specifically British) nationalism existed since time immemorial.
Weird. I distinctly remember reading a passage about an intelligence source that had to be kept secret when Krause finds out about the wolf pack, but when I went back to quote it, all I found was a reference to HF/DF.
