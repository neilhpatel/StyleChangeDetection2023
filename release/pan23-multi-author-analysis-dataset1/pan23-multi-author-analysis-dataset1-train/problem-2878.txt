It just seems like we got put in a corner where we were two naive to ask and nobody ever communicated that the money we had received for personal property was supposed to pay this Restoration company and we thought that the insurance was paying them directly just like they were paying the contractor like they would cut us a check to pass off to the Restoration company but evidently that was not the case. Now the Restoration company is suing us for the fees and we don't have the money to pay them. They refuse to set up a payment plan and they refuse to give us some of the items back and then sell off some of the other items. They will only accept the payment in full within the next 10 days.
High value structural materials and contents that have slight reversible damage are typically cleaned and evaluated by materially interested parties. Damaged materials that cannot be cleaned or are of low value should be documented and removed to facilitate restoration.
