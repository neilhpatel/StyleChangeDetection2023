Ok, so how much was 8 shillings in 1300? Or 24 pounds in 1400? Well, comparing prices and wages across centuries with any degree of accuracy is basically impossible. Wage labor was not nearly as common in the Middle Ages as it is today, and what people spent that money on, and how much of their money they spent on which things, has changed dramatically in the last 700 years or so. The Late Middle Ages was still a time when most people were agricultural workers of some sort who often didn't earn or spend money at all on a daily basis. But for a skilled laborer in the early 14th century, like a mason or a thatcher, a commonly cited wage is two pence a day. That means that in a good year, this person could expect to earn around two pounds, or 40 shillings. So the cheapest, smallest book would still represent more than two month's income. In the years following the plague wages went up (assuming you survived it, of course), but even if your wages had doubled, so had the price of books. As for the large, illuminated books commissioned by cathedrals, universities, or the wealthiest of the wealthy, our skilled laborer might work his entire life, saving every spare farthing he made, and still not have enough to buy one.
NP! Followup q-the article mentions very briefly occasional work that may have been done "on spec"; was this at all done with the more popular works and was it more common on the continent or in England?
