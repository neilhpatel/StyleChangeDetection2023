In a personal injury context, the maxim is that you take the plaintiff as you find them. A minor legal wrong that nonetheless causes major expenses still leaves the defendant liable for those expenses, even if they were not reasonably foreseeable or preventable. That's one of the reasons why employers are expected to carry worker's comp insurance: expensive medical bills due to a workplace accident are a small risk starting on day one of someone's job.
Your health insurance will require you to go through worker's comp for injuries in the workplace. I've never once met a policy that allowed you to make claims for workplace injuries without doing so. It may be what you want, but it's not a reasonable or achievable outcome. You can talk to your insurer to confirm this, or review your policy paperwork.
Your former employer's decision not to carry insurance is of no consequence to you or your rights, or to your obligations to your own insurer. If you want to settle with your boss, you can do so - I would strongly recommend hiring a lawyer to represent you, if you do - but be prepared to settle on the basis of the costs you're willing to eat out of pocket, not costs you wish you could transfer to a different insurer.
No. Under the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act, an employer is required to provide medical care and wage loss benefits for the aggravation of a pre-existing condition.
NAL, Not legal advice. Regardless of what your employer has said, how certain are you that he doesn’t have workmen’s comp coverage? That is a serious lapse with serious consequences, especially in the construction trades. It is possible that he has intentionally misled you in an effort to disguise unsafe work practices and not have a claim against his insurance.
