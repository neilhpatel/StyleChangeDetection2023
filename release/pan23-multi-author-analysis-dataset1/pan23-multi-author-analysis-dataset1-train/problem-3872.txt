He's going to die in prison. Russia will not give him medical care. Russia is the type of regime that murders civilians like it was a sport. I expect the worst.
It all changed once propaganda machine got stronger, but all that it shows is that opinions can transform quite fast, and it all comes to agenda that is being pushed and it has nothing to do with "historically evil country" or whatever nonsense being pushed today.
How did he sell out? By not going back to the US so that he can spend the rest of his life in solitary? Its more the US that betrayed him after he did the right thing.
That's completely different. Navalny did not have an entire state and an army behind him. He was all alone going into Russia and just got arrested. He had zero chance of succeeding. Zelensky, on the other hand, has an army and an entire nation with NATO support behind him. He actually has a decent chance of succeeding, unlike Navalny. Zelensky's move to stay was risky, but not unreasonable. Navalny's move to go into Russia was foolhardy.
I think it was foolish for him to go back to Russia. What the fuck did he expect was going to happen? Hoping that a revolution will arise due to his martyrdom is not a good strategy. It's built entirely on hope. He would be more effective from abroad.
