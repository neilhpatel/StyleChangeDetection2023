Now we have to look where the 144 million inhabitants of Russia are concentrated. For this we can have a look at this graphic:
It sounds so refreshing when you put it this way; I think another cool fact that people would like to know is that a lot of burgeoning urban centers a bit further East (compared to Moscow), were either established or greatly expanded because of WWII and the massive evacuation of people and industries, essentially re-building entire industrial centers in a new place (I think the number of factories, large and small, moved East numbered in the thousands). Is it correct?
Anyway, industrialization and urbanization was largely pushed in certain directions by Soviet planners, and very much with an eye to develop new industries, rather than serve existing market needs (consumer goods were notoriously under-emphasized during the Soviet period, and local industries in rural areas actually were wrecked as rural regions were pushed to produce grain above all else). New cities were located where it made most sense to planners to locate the industries that those cities were to be based around. If this involved paying bonuses to people to, say, mine nickel deposits north of the Arctic Circle in Norilsk, so be it (although the original construction there was done by prisoners).
