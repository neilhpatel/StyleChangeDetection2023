I would let him go ahead with the suit and the rest. The only award the judge can possibly give him is monetary. It will be his burden to collect the money from you even if awarded. I'm not a lawyer, but I've been reading up on small claims cases. Thanks.
As u/Biondina said, the burden of proof will be on your ex-friend to prove that they are entitled to damages on some legal theory, most likely conversion (the civil equivalent of theft). They would have to do so by a preponderance of the evidence, meaning that they would have to prove it is more likely than not that you stole or wrongly kept their property. You would have a chance to refute that claim by offering proof that the items were gifts. In some cases, showing that an item was given in connection with a special event, occasion, or holiday can help to show that a gift was given. Keep in mind that in order for something to be a gift, the owner has to have an intent to transfer ownership to the recipient, as opposed to simply lending the item and expecting to get it back.
