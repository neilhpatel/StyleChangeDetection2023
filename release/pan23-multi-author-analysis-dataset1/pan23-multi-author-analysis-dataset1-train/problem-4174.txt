I think other people are referring you to the state department of labor, as opposed to federal. Some states do have more favorable laws and processes than federal, buts thats something you should look into. Some states don't or might not have very well-functioning processes. I know of nothing saying you have to file with state versus federal. I believe generally though once you file with one, you cannot file another complaint with the other. This is probably something to discuss with an attorney knowledge in employment law in your state before proceeding to choose one, as they would know what the best option is.
As you mentioned you are a law student, can you check in with your law school clinic and see if they have a labor and employment practice? She might be able to get free legal help there and other nonprofits if she's pretty low income. The fact that it seems this is a regular practice and apparently a large employer would probably make it pretty attractive to them, especially if she knows other people this is happening to from work she can also encourage to join in any legal proceedings.
That's what I told her. They would almost certainly settle this, and if they didn't, a judge would probably award hefty punitive damages. So, again, they would settle lol.
Yup a lot of states for auto insurance exclude coverage if workers compensation coverage should apply, and most other states are secondary coverage to workers comp or similar insurance.
