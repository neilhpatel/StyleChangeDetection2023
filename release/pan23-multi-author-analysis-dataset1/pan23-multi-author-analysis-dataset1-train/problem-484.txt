How likely? And which people get the money? Does a white persons that’s a descendent of a slave get reparations? Does everyone need to take a dna test?
Rather than addressing any type of institutional racism in their police departments or fixing redlining, you’re content with giving every black American (many of whom would not be descendants of slaves, for example an immigrant from Nigeria) a few thousand dollars instead of lasting and consequential change? I’ve always found people in favor of monetary reparations to be incredibly naive and terribly short-sighted.
But so what? How is it close to fair to take money from someone who did no wrong and give it to someone who suffered no personal harm. The person living today has no personal experience of slavery. By that logic, everyone should get reparations (from whom I can’t imagine) because someone in their genetic past.
