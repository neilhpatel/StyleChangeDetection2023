So that bit about Chinese funding for Soviet opposition in Afghanistan really caught my attention. I was completely unaware and the issue is tremendously topical with the PRC presently working to stabilize and influence the new Taliban government through their well established investment strategy.
But the answer really does not end there. The United States government did fund numerous Islamist opposition groups to the communist government in Afghanistan, and did so persistently from the founding of the communist government to its downfall. This money, weapons, training and other forms of state aid for the anti-communist effort was funneled to numerous mujahadeen groupings, and pretty much anybody who said they did not like the Soviet Union or PDPA. The US was not the only one funding these groups, with the People's Republic of China also seeing the presence of another pro-Soviet government on its borders as a threat. There was also backing from numerous right wing governments in neighbouring countries (all of which would have themselves been beneficiaries of American aid, and were using that fact to offload older or surplus equipment to the mujahadeen), and from other Western states such as the United Kingdom. It is important to keep in mind that direct distribution of support was largely left to local allies, such as the Pakistani ISI.
