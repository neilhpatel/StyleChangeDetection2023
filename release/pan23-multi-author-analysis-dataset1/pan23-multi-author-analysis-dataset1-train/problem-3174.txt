Rent goes up. Tax goes up at the same rate. Interest rates go up. Taxes go down. Rates go down, taxes go up. This caps landlord, and hedge fund profits if they hold onto real-estate.
Totally. Housing programs need to be backed up with other social programs so people can integrate into communities and have incentives to not be antisocial. Housing is only the first step.

Typical American mindset. "I want reforms and improvements but don't want to be personally affected by them." It's why our society is so stagnant and nothing ever is fixed or improved. No one wants to actually pay the higher taxes for social reform, or no one wants to see or face the projects directly out of financial concern or other biases and prejudices. Americans expect things to be fixed with magical solutions without requiring them to endure any actual change or sacrifice in their own lives. Such a selfish nation honestly, and the selfishness is literally killing us.
