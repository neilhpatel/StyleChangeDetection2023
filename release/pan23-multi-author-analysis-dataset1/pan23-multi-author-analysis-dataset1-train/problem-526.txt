I know you didn't. I just stated how silly Falwell's point was on the purse argument. The whole stereotyping people based on how they dress or what they are carrying is such horseshit to me. Anyone can rock a purse. I carried a purse in college, with compartments for my books and another for my cell phone. I would gladly rock a purse again, because I hate carrying things in my pockets. I used to have a fanny pack, but that ended up breaking.
So vile and disgusting; a hateful false narrative that only applies to pedophiles, which apparently Desantis cannot differentiate between. These are not groomers, nor do they need control by the very people who have a much larger penchance apparently for children.
