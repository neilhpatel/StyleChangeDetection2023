You're overthinking this. People's sites get taken down all the time without copyright registration being required. They wouldn't force you to take down your site, they'd make your provider take down your site. Or you'd make their provider take down theirs. Or both.
Basically if I go into this and make an original character with a catchy website title offering a niche service and skip all copyrighting, are you basically saying that I'd be protected (udner "copyright protection") even if someone else copied me / tried to C&D me / shut me down (via them copyrighting it since I never did)?
Here's the bottom line though. Let's say someone "stole" your website. If they are also in the U.S. you'd need to hire a lawyer to sue them in federal court, which can take a long time, costs a lot of money, and doesn't guarantee anything. If they are outside the U.S. there's little you can do. So make your website, have fun, and if someone copies it, issue a DMCA.
Copyright only protects fixed(written) creative contributions. The execution of an idea basically, not the underlying idea. And someone can't come later and force you to take down your site, because they have the same idea.
