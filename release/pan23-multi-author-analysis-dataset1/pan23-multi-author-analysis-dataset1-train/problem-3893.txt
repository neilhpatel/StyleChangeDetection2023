“Xenophobic” was the term being tossed around pretty heavily if I recall when a lot of us were calling for bans on Chinese flights until they get their reporting correct. But what do I know!
I do think we need to test people from China on arrival to monitor the variants from there (because CCP lies about the covid situation in China and is not keen to share accurate information, like they did when the pandemic started) but banning entry to people doesn't achieve anything (variants will spread anyway) and is a simple move which scores easy political points.
Smh. Either a majority of people are really just guppies and can’t retain any information for an extended period of time, or reddit is just a domestic propaganda machine now. Or even worse: both.
Do you know that for a vaccine resistant variant to grow, it would most likely be in a population with high immunity, and given that in China, people have no immunity, the chances of such a variant to emerge are actually low?
Whaddya mean? It's still around, everywhere. Covid hasn't stopped just because the news stopped talking about it. In my country we have a record number of sick in hospitals right now, though thankfully very few in the ICU.
