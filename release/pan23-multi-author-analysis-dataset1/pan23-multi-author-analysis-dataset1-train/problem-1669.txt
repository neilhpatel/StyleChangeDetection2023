I agree. As I commented to someone else, I stuck to my feelings about this and requested they speak to the current tenant again ASAP to arrange a walkthrough this weekend. The landlord wasn’t rude or hostile towards me and said that he will speak to the person again, and he will be at the unit twice this weekend to get a contractor estimate. I insisted that’s the best opportunity for us to meet. So we’ll see what happens!
Alternatively, ask that the photos be incorporated into the lease and provide a general warranty that the apartment is in good condition- essentially representing that the photos accurately describe the condition of the apartment.
No, they do not. It’s an independent landlord I found on CL vs. an apartment complex. I’m very happy I was selected but I also want to do a walkthrough. So I may just call him and try to explain….
Renting from an agent, they generally won't let you sign the contract until you've seen the property, so best to practice the same process renting from a landlord directly It seems like he understands but don't feel bad at all, just stick to your guns and hold out for the inspection, otherwise you may regret it.
Great Point. My guidance assumes they can actually rent the unit. In which case even more reason to at least see a model/similar unit. If they can’t/won’t show others, run.
