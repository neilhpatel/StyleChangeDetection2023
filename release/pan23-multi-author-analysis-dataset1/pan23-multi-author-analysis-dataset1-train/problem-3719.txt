New York has very bad (for the parent) GP laws - several other subs have detailed people's experiences. The good news for you is it is extremely expensive to litigate - so the lawyer sending a letter could be the start and end of it. You'd be best served to at least get a consultation with an attorney in your area to be prepared. Get a lawyer who can shut it down in New York and has experience with GP rights. Also, document EVERYTHING.
The default is not that the parent must prove the visits shouldn't happen. The opposing party must show detriment if the visits don't happen. This is because parental rights are protected by the US Constitution, so the parent gets to choose who to let into their kid's life. It's up to the opposing party to prove the contact must happen. Not the parent to prove it mustn't.
I expect she has a pretty strong case for visitation, but if you do not trust her to communicate courteously, you might want to ask for help setting up communication through a third party site that offers monitored communications and scheduling services. Those products do have a cost, but they may provide the structure to help you manage an otherwise adversarial relationship. u/Fuego_pants's advice is also excellent if you decide to actually try to go no contact, but you should also plan for the possibility that the judge says no.
