In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Exactly. Bidens team could have said nothing about this and no one would have ever noticed anything was gone like they didn’t for 6 years, and they still let it be known and gave them back. There’s absolutely no real equivalency here. It’s not even remotely close to the same situation to expect there to be a raid. Yet the right will pretend to the end of time it’s the same thing, and the media will fall for it.
