Two weeks notice is courtesy. There is no legal obligation to do so in most cases, but not burning your bridges at the very least can lead to a positive recommendation in the future. Thereâ€™s also opportunities for severance/vacation pay if you have any. If you have any employment contract with them, make sure to read it over and see if there is any required notice.
I really appreciate your feedback but this is the same guy who smacked me in the back of my head purposelly with his elbow as I was sitting down and it was intentional and it was very hard to the point that no way was it accidental so when I got up to confront him about it acted as if the incident never happened and there were already previous incidents that already had me develop a "guard" around the guy which is why I said I had no choice but to confront the guy because I knew there was negative intentions from him and now he was causing me physical harm. So I hope you can understand why i feel a little cautious about giving 2 weeks.
