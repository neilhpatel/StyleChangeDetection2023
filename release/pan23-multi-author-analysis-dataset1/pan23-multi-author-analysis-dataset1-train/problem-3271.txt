I would not count them out completely-it's absolutely possible for Russia to reform their military. However Russia might very well lose Crimea before it can do so-particularly if Ukraine manages to split their line in two as their bridge has been destroyed.
More basically, if Ukraine can cut off the coastal highway it's may also be in range to start seriously damaging the bridge. Regardless, if Russia has to retreat across the bridge while under fire, they are so spectacularly screwed. Death corridor would not even close to describe it.
In the first few days and weeks of the invasion, the world hadn't yet woken up to the incompetence of the Russian army, and Ukraine's incredible resolve was obvious, but their ability to resist was still the subject of some doubts.
Yeah. I know Sweden has 500 of them (which is quite a number tbh) but still. Arguing for a year over 6-12 archers with little mention of IFVs, then from nowhere announcing an IFV donation the same size as the US one... it's quite something.
