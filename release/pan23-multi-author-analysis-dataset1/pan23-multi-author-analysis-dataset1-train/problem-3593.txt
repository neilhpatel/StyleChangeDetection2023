Also, ways of cheating on exams seems an interesting topic, and a pretty good business to run, making cheating-underwear. Very very cool.
Within Cao Xueqin's famous Dream of the Red Chamber, one of the main characters is Jia Baoyu who is extremely negatively affected by his strict, Confucian scholar-official father and he is both apprehensive and put-off by the civil service system, pointing to the extremely uncomfortable social position that sons of men of learning were put in. They were expected to succeed both for the honor of the family and for a chance to advance the social standing of their clan. In Liaozhai Zhiyi, or Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, a famous collection of some 500 short stories written by Pu Songling, there is one story contained within the anthology that describes a young scholar's unsuccessful attempts at taking the metropolitan exams in the capital. He returns to his home, heartbroken from his failures and quickly falls gravely ill and perishes. Then his corpse/zombie/ghost/spirit thing wanders back into the capital to retake the metropolitan exam, which he passes, but upon his return, his wife points out to him that he has long since died, at which point his spirit vanishes into thin air. Quite bizarre, I know. Pu Songling himself was born into a gentry family that had fallen onto hard times, and he was a repeatedly unsuccessful candidate for the Gongsheng degree, or the Provincial-level exams. As a result, he grew rather disillusioned with the entire system, not unlike many other disgruntled scholars from both the Ming and the Qing, where the examination was extremely competitive. That shit makes the bar exam look like a walk in the park. Pu Songling's story is one that emphasizes the sort of intense nature of the late Imperial Chinese examination system. Both men write of an unforgiving system for those unfortunate enough to pass through them as failures.
