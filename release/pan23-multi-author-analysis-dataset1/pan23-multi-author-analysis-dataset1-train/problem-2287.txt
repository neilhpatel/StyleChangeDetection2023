You will need to reach out to the landlord. As long as she has the income to pay for the place herself, the landlord will likely allow you to terminate the lease and her start a new lease.
If her income doesn’t support the landlord’s requirements (usually 3x the monthly rent), then the landlord might have problems taking you off the lease.
Probably. A person can only be removed from an existing limited term, non-month-to-month lease with the permission of all parties to the lease unless the lease describes a method otherwise.
You can also ask both your ex and the landlord if they're willing to remove you from the lease, or possibly with some sort of monetary payment, they don't have to agree to any terms whatsoever.
Your ex, if they're thinking straight, wants you out but still on the lease so if your ex doesn't pay they might be able to get away with it if the landlord only goes after you.
The landlord will likely still want you on the lease as an additional person they can go after if your ex doesn't pay.
