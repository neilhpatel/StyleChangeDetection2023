Throw in people having their retirement fund managed by a 3rd party, and not knowing that part of their portfolio had this shit in it in the first place. I lost some money despite being very conservative with how my fund was set up. I want to know who the hell underwrote this and certified the risk level so that Blackrock could even have part of peoples retirement portfolio invested in this garbage. Because IMO they should be drug out into a public square and someone should give their kneecaps the misery treatment as a warning.
Unsurprising. I've entertained myself with crypto-hoax videos and the one thing that keeps repeating is how fucking incompetent people who couldn't make it in real investing are regarded as geniuses when they come to the crypto scene and make big promises.
They'll be fine. It only amounts to less that a few percent of the fund. That's not to dismiss the point, just to highlight the fund isn't overly exposed to FTX.
Centralized exchanges definitely need regulation, absolutely. Fiat backed stablecoins ( see Tether / USDC ) also need regulation to ensure they actually are worth what they say they are.
