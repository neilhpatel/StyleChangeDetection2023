Germany, 2014-2022: "Yes, we are Russia's second largest trading partner. And, yes, Russia is in the process of invading and annexing Ukraine. But Here, look, we're giving less than 5% the money we give to Russia to Ukraine We're even now. What? Allies telling us to reduce our dependence on Russian energy? Haha! No. That's laughable. Why would we do that?".
I actually did the same mistake once :/ Luckily I noticed the mistake still back home and as we arrived late evening and had next flight early next morning we had plenty of time to get a transportation (opted for cab in the end - wasn't that bad when spilt the cost among 4 of us) but it did add an unnecessary stress and I did feel foolish for not double checking everything etc. Lesson learned I guess. But damn, I can't even imagine how heartbreaking t is if there are not enough time to transfer...
Interesting. Are you saying that Gazprom and Rosneft are not Russian state owned enterprises? Or perhaps that Russia couldn't possibly have used profits from its state owned enterprises to fund its war machine?
