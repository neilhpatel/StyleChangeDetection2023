Identity in Anglo-Saxon England is quite an interesting topic with a great deal of variety. There were numerous and often overlapping identities that were at play. The Venerable Bede tells us that many of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms claimed descent from certain parts of northern Germany and Scandinavia (we know in reality there were no such neat divisions), but there were often far more important markers than supposed ethnicity. Religious identity, as Christians (which we would call Catholic today) was of primary importance, and later on for example in the Viking Age the English/Anglo-Saxons were often contrasted with the "Danes" indicating at least some level of "othering" going on between the two.
When did this change? The Germans by WW2 certainly considered the English to be under their cultural orbit, and the English, while not going so far as to call themselves "Germanic" seemed to consider the Germans to be closer kin to them than the French or Spanish. Was this because of growing cultural connections or religion?
