It must really suck to be a Republican right now. Basically their party clearly has been co-opted, it’s massively lost the respect of the public by not doing the right thing time and again, has become the party for open racism and misogyny, and is moving in very un-American directions - anti-democracy, anti-Constitution, anti equalitarianism, party before country. No sane American is going to respect that kind of crap. Better that they clean house from the inside sooner rather than later.
Don’t forget defunding the public education system so that their evangelical Bible school indoctrination radicalization “teaching” can guide the future generations on the right way to vote “morally righteous path.”.
Crenshaw is such a clown. He knows he’s the picture perfect poster boy for the conservative ubermensch. Veteran, white, conservative, eye patch. Yet he’s a grifter like the rest of them and none of his constituents can see it.
