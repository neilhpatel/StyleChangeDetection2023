ALMATY, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Kazakh rights activists sent Ukraine fresh bundles of aid this week including clothing, medicines - and three huge round multi-coloured yurts - a not-so coded message of support from the citizens of a country traditionally close to Moscow.
The folkloric nomad tents sent to give Ukrainians a place to keep warm are part of a steady stream of donations from Kazakh civic groups that has angered Moscow and tested the Kazakh government's so far guarded stance on Russia's invasion.
But with Russia's longest land border and a large, if declining, ethnic Russian population, Kazakhstan is also warier than other neighbours about President Vladimir Putin's stated policy of using force to protect Russian-speakers abroad.
If you get the chance, do it. They can be very cozy. IMHO, much better staying in a seasonal yurt that's "fresh" every winter vs a permanent western style cabin/shelter that has had years/decades to get the grime of all the seasons, critters, 1000s of hours of stove use, and hundreds of visitors.
Is that the case? Kazakhstan just hasn't commented on the Ukraine war, rather than denouncing Russia or aiding Ukraine, and the yurts were sent by activists, not representatives of the nation. Kazakhstan is in a bit of a sensitive position, so I'm not saying I expect them to go to bat for Ukraine, but they're still definitely playing the politics game, the humanity side of things is being done by private citizens.
