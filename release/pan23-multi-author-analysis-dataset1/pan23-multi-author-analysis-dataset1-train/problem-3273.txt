I'm not so sure, as I'm sure someone has explained to him the Speaker of the House is second in the line of succession to the US President. Trump had no problem fomented an insurrection via violent mob, do you think he'd draw the line at two assassinations-by-proxy via a mix of stochastic terrorism and mafia-level innuendo?
Are you kidding that would be beautiful! He is an incompetent boon destroying his party by his own narcissism that he can’t control. And his party know that following him will make them losers. Moderate Republicans would bolt to the Dems on deals. It would be gold.
3rd in line for the presidency though…and I could see him looking the other way if some nefarious characters decided to remove the two “obstacles” to his being reinstated as President.
Yes and no. Should both the President and VP become incapacitated at the same time, then the Speaker of the House would become the President. But if the VP takes over as President and appoints a VP, that VP becomes the President and not the Speaker.
