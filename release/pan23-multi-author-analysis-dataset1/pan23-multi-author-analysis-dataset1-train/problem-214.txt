While more answers are always welcome (especially since you include some follow-up questions), for the 45 trillion claim, discusses the claim in detail, and by /u/IconicJester is of particular note. A quote:
The more specific claim on which this misunderstanding is probably piggybacking is that India used to have a much larger share of the world economy, and specifically of manufacturing exports. But here modern analogies lead us very far astray indeed. Long-distance trade in manufactured goods was a vanishingly small part of economies before the modern period. India's large share of this trade, divided by its large population, does not suggest that India was notably rich.

While there are great yawning gaps in our understanding of historical incomes, there is no evidence at all that India was ever one of the richest regions of the world. Our income estimates from the "Mughal peak," while higher than the low point of the mid-colonial period, don't even come close to the levels suggested for Song dynasty China, for Italy during the renaissance, or for the Dutch during the golden age. India was poor before colonisation (as was pretty much everywhere in the world) and it certainly wasn't the richest in relative terms. In 1700, on the eve of widespread colonisation, a ballpark estimate based on current historical GDP estimates would be that India had about half the income level of the European colonisers.
