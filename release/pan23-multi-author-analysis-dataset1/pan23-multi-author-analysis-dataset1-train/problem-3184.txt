You are entirely right, at least in terms of higher academic scholarship, on all counts. There has been a surge in the past several years of addressing other ethnic and religious minorities in Northern Ireland during the Troubles (especially Jews and Hindus when it comes to religion and - I think really interestingly? - there are several great texts about the black experience both in the US with relation to the Irish conflict, and the black population of NI). Here at Queen's University Belfast, we did a forum earlier this year about religious/ethnic difference during the Troubles. But Travellers are so often left out of the literature entirely, sometimes for the reasons you stated and sometimes because there is legitimate dissent about how that community wants to talk about the effect the Troubles had on them/they had on the Troubles.
P.P.S. A note to OP: Good on you for striving to be a better informed friend! The world needs more of you.
It's somewhat ironic - or, maybe not, based on how the political and cultural workings WITHIN the various IRA sects changed so much over the decades - that the Provisional movement is widely associated with Palestinian liberation, often training and trading weapons with armed PLO sections. Gerry Adams made (or attempted to make) several trips to meet with Hamas representatives in the 2000s. The symbolic, cultural gesture of solidarity also lead to a reactionary backlash: there's a reason the UK flag is often right above the flag of Israel in modern Belfast, with the Irish flag above the Palestinian one. This is not to make any claims about the relative personal feelings of Republicans during the Troubles towards the Jewish people, but the ever-changing realities of political struggle and dissidence often redraw lines of alliance and support.
Thanks for all of this! Yes I've been interested in those symbolic gestures of solidarity ever since I first learned a little about the Troubles. It's fascinating stuff.
