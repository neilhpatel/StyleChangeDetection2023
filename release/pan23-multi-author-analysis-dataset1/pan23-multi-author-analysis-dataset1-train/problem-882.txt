I hope you don’t mind if I expand on your last point regarding oral narratives! Folklorists have conventionally distinguished three broad kinds of narratives: folktale and legend (as you mentioned) with myth its own separate category. Yes, myths were told to be believed, but not really in the same sense as legends. Myths were “believed” in terms of their conveyance of a “sacred truth” according to a culture’s religious system. As such, they usually involve deities or semi-divine heroes and take place in sort of protohistorical times (if they’re on Earth, at least) or explain how something came to be or will end, for example. Legends are also historical, but in a human world, if that makes sense, and are generally disseminated regionally or manipulated to make sense in a certain locale (for example, we’ve all heard urban legends that are thematically similar wherever you hear them, but the geographical details and the characters are always different so that the content of the legend is more believable).
Thanks. I mainly thought you'd appreciate a reference to Ultima Thule in an answer in /r/AskHistorians. It is time for the rise of the Kuiper Belt and the redemption of Pluto!
