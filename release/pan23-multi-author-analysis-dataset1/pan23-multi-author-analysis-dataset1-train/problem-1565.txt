Cairo ("kay-row") was a ferry and steamboat port in the mid 19th Century. They used to ferry railcars across the Ohio and Mississippi at Cairo. The completion of the rail bridge at Memphis in 1892 reduced traffic, and further bridges built from 1905 to 1937 completely eliminated the ferry business, and both rail and road bridges now bypass Cairo, which was pretty much a death knell for the town.

Cairo is extremely flood-prone, completely surrounded by levees. Its situation certainly did not attract early settlers: it wasn't even founded until 1837, decades after other areas of Southern Illinois and the Ohio Valley, and grew very slowly.
. . . all true, but nonetheless, in the middle of an intensely vulnerable area, and thus not inviting any further development. A city isn't just the city proper, but its communications and outlying areas . . . and as you note, to grow would have required a great deal of further investment.
