An approach I often use when talking to customer service about a problem is to tell the person who answers the phone something like (in restrained but cordial tones) "I want you to know that I am very angry about an experience I had. I know that you're not to blame, so I will do my best not to take this out on you. But I need your help to resolve the problem.".
Now, considering the fact that I have been supporting and playing this game for several months – and, as a matter of fact, spent a conspicuous amount of money on it as well – I demand that my account is restored to the way it was before the hacking occurred.
/u/PM_ME_HOLE_PICS is right. Don't make demands, don't declare that you hold them responsible. You will need a good relationship with their customer service people to fix your problem-- and remember that whoever you're talking to didn't cause the problem in the first place. You want them on your side, not against you. I've worked customer service jobs. Taking a demanding tone will not help you.
Unfortunately today, after logging in at 2PM on Genshin Impact, I noticed that someone had hacked into my account, using all my wishes and wiping my inventory clean. (see attachments).
