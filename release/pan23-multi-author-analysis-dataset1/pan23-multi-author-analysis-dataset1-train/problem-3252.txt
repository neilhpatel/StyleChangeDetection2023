That's not obvious at all. SBF was heavily lobbying to get a bill (DCCPA) pushed through that would give him a regulatory moat at the expense of other decentralized market participants and other centralized exchanges as well. That bill was introduced by stabenow, a dem from Michigan whose committee has oversight over the CFTC who would be his main regulator if it were to pass. It's really healthy to not try to hold up the dem party as some moral beacon beyond reproach. They are not that.
The difference is that dishonest democrats are a few scattered, disorganized individuals, who get rooted out and jailed or eliminated from politics ASAP. The criminal Republicans are a large proportion of their elected officials, who are organized, and who cover for each other. What started out as a Republican effort to hold onto power and to enrich themselves was a vulnerability that the KGB/FSB discovered and exploited after 2010.
Zero sum?? The free market means mutual agreement to trade, neither side being forced to transact. Sounds pretty fair. If you truly believe that is zero sum then there is no system that currently exists that isnâ€™t.
