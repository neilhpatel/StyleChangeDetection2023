I haven't heard about that one either, but I did hear the one where he went to an event honoring some people who donated to a charity. He went on stage and took a seat with everyone who donated. The only problem was that he hadn't donated anything. He just decided that he should be honored also as if he donated and insured insisted on sitting there. The guy whose seat he took was forced to sit in the audience instead of being on stage and being honored with the rest of the donors.
Exactly. Mitch McConnell was in charge of republican party policy before trump and he's still here after. Trump looks more and more like he was McConnell's useful idiot.
Yuuuup. They created and then set loose a monster. This is the part where it rampages through the lab and destroys everyone, and we get to just hang back and bask in the irony.
Seriously. Presumably the major donor was also wealthy and influential, but had too much class to make a scene. I’d like to think that in the same scenario I’d have an assistant carry out a chair for me mid-ceremony and place it directly in front of DJT.
