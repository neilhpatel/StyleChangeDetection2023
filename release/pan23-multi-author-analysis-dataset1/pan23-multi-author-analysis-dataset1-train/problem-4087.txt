So I have no memory of seeing this movie, though my wife says we saw it in the theaters, but in any case: it's not likely Jack would have been to Singapore, because during the early 1700s, ish, when the movie is set, Singapore wasn't really a thing. It was the property of the Sultan of Malacca Sultanate of Johor, and it wasn't until 1819 with the arrival of the British East India company that the islands started to grow in prosperity.
3. Among the most important ports were the ports in the Riau Islands of which Singapore was one of the ports (not the main port which was in Batam/Bintan, but still a location where there was a settlement).
C.S. Forester's Hornblower series: An early version of the historical naval series. Less well-written than O'Brian's, but with interesting characterization and attention to detail.
For SE Asia Manila would be one good candidate. It was in Spanish possession since the late 16th century, and the famous Manila Galleon - trade from China via Manila - started from there to West Mexico. The Galleon ships were a coveted prize that at least early one pirates and privateers hoped to take, some of them in the service of European monarchs and some even successfully (in the Americas): so the place would've surely been familiar.
Not at all. Dampier (mentioned above) sailed with Charles Swan across the Pacific to raid East Asia starting in 1686 (they left from the western coast of what's now Mexico), and returned to England by 1691 -- this was by no means a direct voyage, but his later expedition on HMS Roebuck left England on January 14, 1699 and arrived at Shark Bay, in western Australia, on August 6 of the same year.
4. At the signing of the treaty of Singapore in Early 19th Century there was a settlement with both Malay and Chinese people. The Temenggong of Johor resided in Singapore due to civil strife, but he did pick the location to set up his capital.
