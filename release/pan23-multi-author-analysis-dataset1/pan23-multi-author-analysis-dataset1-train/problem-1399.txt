In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yep. We should probably do something about that. US road fatality rates are 4-5x the rates in the Netherlands (normalised to population). That is despite the fact that 1/3 of Netherlands road deaths are cyclists (much more vulnerable). Maybe the US should look into how the Netherlands (and several other countries) designs itâ€™s cities and infrastructure to reduce road deaths.
Absolutely true. One of the most effective ways to take care of citizens is to make sure violent nutjobs don't have protected legal access to killing machines.

Ok even if your assertion is true a) banning it is unconstitutional and does not remove all the weapons that can easily replace it and b) that still does not discount the fact that compared to the numbers of dead from all other guns and gun types AR15s and "assault weapons" still account for the smallest segment of gun deaths which is like focusing on Porsche regulation because they killed Ryan Dunn and Paul Walker and leaving all other cars alone because they are not "sports cars".
Try again. I didn't say require ID, or require a license to carry openly or concealed. I said require a gun license specifically before you can buy a gun of any kind.
