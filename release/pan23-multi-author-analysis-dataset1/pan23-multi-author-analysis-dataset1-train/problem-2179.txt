If RNC moves their primary to SC first as well, Nancy Mace actually has a really good shot. While we do have a truly embarrassing and terrifying amount of Trump support here, there are enough moderates/primary jumpers who would rather her be the candidate than Trump, for whatever reason. (SC has open primaries you do not have to be registered with a party to vote in their primary, but you can only vote in one party primary per election year. That's for the state at least. I haven't lived here long enough to know how the federal election primary works - there was no R primary in 2020 at the federal level.).

This is her way of being the anti-Elise Stefanick and not going "Full MAGAGAGAGAGA" to the point where Trump looks moderate, and losing clout on the Hill, but not allying closely w/ Dems either and winding up like that guy from Michigan who wound up losing his primary after the DCCC poured huge amounts of cash to a Full MAGA candidate in the primary. This way she can use her status like Boebert and Gaetz did to force changes in how McCarthy operates. It's all a strategy game and anyone who thinks she should vote like AOC to prove her "self worth" are fully delusional.
