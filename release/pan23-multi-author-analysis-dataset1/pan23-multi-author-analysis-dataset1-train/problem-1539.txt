I've never seen or read anything about youth who were specifically against rock and roll, most sources focus on the moral panic adults displayed-but that doesn't mean there weren't kids who didn't rebel by listening to rock music in the 50s and 60s, however, that doesn't mean that those kids were listening to older music (in fact, since raime was largely forgotten by the general public until it was re-popularized in the 1970s by and then the soundtrack of The Sting its a safe bet they didn't listen to Raime)-More likely they would have been listening to "safe" pop artists like Neil Sedaka and Paul Anka. Or, maybe they weren't listening to pop-keep in mind that wasn't the only choice. We like to divide history into neat little eras and assume that since the rock and roll era started in the 1950s, that meant Jazz's time in the sun was over-but two of the most important-and most popular jazz albums of all time, by Miles Davis and by Dave Brubeck were released in 1959- so plenty of people were still listening to Jazz and not listening to pop or rock at all.
It depends! When he first met Keith Richards, the young Mick Jagger famously was wandering around London prominently carrying copies of albums ordered via mail order from Chess Records in Chicago. Specialty record labels focused on compilations of old trad jazz or folk etc would, for instance, advertise in magazines to try and catch the attention of the right people. Such record labels would send out mail-order catalogs, and you could post back a list of the albums/singles you wanted along with a cheque for the appropriate amount. Alternatively, some people in the UK had found the music simply by going to the USA and collecting it there; Van Morrison's father famously had one of the biggest jazz/blues-focused record collections in Northern Ireland, and much of it had been acquired during time he spent in Chicago. Finally, at least some of the music that inspired trad jazz and skiffle was relatively easy to find in the UK for collectors, second-hand, as old 78s, given some patient searching.
