They really can't. At least not anywhere near their original goal of taking over the whole country, installing a puppet goverment, while annexing huge amounts of territory, and then getting the International community to just accept it. That victory condition will never happen, Russia literally doesn't have enough shit or dude. And at this point it is highly doubtful that Russia can keep the territory it has already conquered. They just don't have enough manpower, nor the ability to manufacture peer level weapons systems. Maybe if Ukraine had just been left on it's own, but not with most of the world giving aid. Even if each individual country is just dripping weapons and aid, it is just cumulatively too much for Russia to really handle long term.
Really? They haven't been on a remotely similar level to the US in decades, and even when they had similar levels of arms....they didn't have the leadership, training or industrial might the US had. They were effective in ww2 because the US supplied them.
