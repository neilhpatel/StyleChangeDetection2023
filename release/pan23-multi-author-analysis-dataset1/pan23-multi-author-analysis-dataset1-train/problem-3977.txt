Personally I do not agree with how it was called out on the Zoom, but it likely didn't rise to the legal of a legal issue. While discriminating against you for a disability is illegal, discriminating against you for not having a vaccine (if that's what's happening) is not illegal, not a legal problem at all, unless you've addressed it with your company. Retaliation based on vaccine status is NOT illegal, not without any protected class context, which you have yet to give them.
Again, I'm not in favor of people blurting out vaccine questions, we don't allow that, but it's not necessarily a legal issue. One big challenge here is that it's unlikely these folks have connected the dots between your anaphylaxis and the COVID vaccines. It would be a good time to educate them. Not sure there's much more to do here.
And since so many companies are starting to require vaccines, it would probably be in your best interest to have it properly documented beforehand that you legitimately cannot receive this vaccine, in the event that your company starts requiring them too.
This is the opposite of what you needed to do. While the ingredients of all three vaccines are well-known, if you have a medical reason for not getting the vaccine you should get your doctor to write a letter about it, and you make a request for a medical accommodation. The opposite, keeping mum, isn't going to help. As you've discovered. (Technically you might not need a letter, but it's easier.).
I've also been advised by my doctor to avoid getting vaccinated and I have former medical accommodations back from college and grad school to get exemptions for attendance without meeting their vaccination requirements to attend.
First a question. There is a conference with a large client with a strict vaccine requirement. You are not vaccinated. Did you ask how this was going to work when you attendance was being planned?
