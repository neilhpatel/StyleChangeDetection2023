Very ugly, but it is not like the world is not ugly today. Putin does not need a super storm as an excuse to invade. The Junta does not need a super storm as an excuse to oppress. Iran does not need a super storm to murder girls for their hair.
I mean, we do what we reasonably can in our home, but if you're living in the modern world, you're driving a car, and living in a home with electricity and AC and heating and using a computer that's running on power generated, probably by fossil fuels, and your consumption of things wrapped in plastic is coming from oil and polluting the planet.
No, that it won't. Projects like that are very much a symptom of what I describe. It is all biology. I know it is grim but inevitable that our population will eventually reach its natural limits. first it stagnates and eventually it will decline. And yes, there there will be fights for survival. It may take another 50, 200, or a 1000 years, but it will happen. The question is just in what state the planet will be when it happens.
Fearmongering nonsense. Water is neither created nor destroyed. And there is plenty of it for a lot more people and life than the planet has now.
