The conclusive connection between the discharge of these fish and electricity was not made until the 1740s with the development of Leyden jars (basically capacitors for storing static electricity).
No problem! It's worth noting, in response to the first half of the quote I did from you: it appears as though the term electric eel has a first citation . One would wager to say then, since it was first described (a mere eight years prior), the typical pattern of etymology in other New World species (opossum being a prime example, being ), and the earliest citation of electric eel occurring after the binomial name, I would wager to say it's likely any preceding names for it were just borrowings in several European languages from the surrounding indigenous languages, most of which did not survive very long (also borrowed into Spanish), which is from (which exists in the present day as ).
