It was more that soldiers didn't want to continue fighting a war Russia didn't have the capacity, leadership or resources to fight. When the Bolsheviks seized power in St Petersburg in 1917, they had been promised by Lenin peace, land and bread - and then deserted en masse back to their villages to chase that dream. Yet in the years of civil war to come, peace, land and bread were hard to come by.
Anyhow, the Bolsheviks steadily increased their influence and members within the Congress of Soviets, and when the Bolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government, the Congress legitimized the act and transferred power to the Congress, which at that point had a majority of either Bolshevik delegates or their left Socialist-Revolutionary allies (who stopped supporting the Bolsheviks in July 1918). This Congress (which saw other parties walk out of) established a Bolshevik Cabinet pending the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, which met for a day in January 1918 before being locked out by Red Guards.
