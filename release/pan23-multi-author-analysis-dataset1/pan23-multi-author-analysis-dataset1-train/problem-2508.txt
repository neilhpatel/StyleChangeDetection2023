The Marihuana Tax Act was passed in 1937 (1). Coincidentally, around the time machine automating hemp harvesting was invented, and just before Popular Mechanics called hemp a billion dollar cash crop(3), the first time this terminology was ever used. Apparently, Dow chemicals didnâ€™t like an all-natural competition to their petroleum-based plastic products (Henry Ford had a model T with a body built from hemp-based plastic in the 1941)(2).
