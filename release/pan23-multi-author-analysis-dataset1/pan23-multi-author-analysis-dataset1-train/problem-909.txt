The image and idea of Columbus has gone through several phases, historically, but the focus here is going to be on the current epoch, and the rise of Columbus Day, as that plays the most important part in your question and the current perception and how we got there.
Now, I need hardly point out that as time passed through the past century, attitudes changed significantly towards Columbus, and by the 1992 anniversary, Columbus was a very controversial figure, and has only gotten more so since then, as anyone looking at the news this week is clearly aware! Due to the 20 year rule, I'm not going to discuss the current stuff in-depth, and whether we should be destroying these statues but the indigenous peoples of the Americas are, unsurprisingly, the leader in opposition to the continuing celebration of a man who more and more are coming to recognize as the kickstarter of a mass genocide (and don't miss /u/Snapshot52 who ); and as perspectives change, the Italian-American lobby has been at the forefront of holding onto what they consider to be their national holiday.
