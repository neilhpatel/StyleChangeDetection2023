Turkey/Ottoman Empire has probably fought more wars with Russia than any other nation and stopped Russian expansion to warm seas for over three centuries. USSR was at Turkish border just 30 years ago, NATO nukes in Izmir were the reason behind Cuban missile crisis. Turkey controls access to all warm water Russian ports in Black Sea, recently fought against Russian forces in Syria and Libya, and is the only NATO country that shot down a Russian jet since Korean War.
Staged as in "faked". The Turkish army has performed several successful coups throughout the years, but this one against Erdogan mysteriously failed. And immediately afterwards, Erdogan performs a huge power grab and has lists of THOUSANDS of people to be imprisoned at the ready.
And when Erdogan then proceeds to detain and dismiss nearly 3000 judges WITHIN A DAY of the coup attempt, things get extremely fishy. It's almost as if there were already lists of people that Erdogan wanted purged. All he needed was an excuse. And faking a coup attempt was that excuse.
Once courts and prosecutors started prosecuting and sentencing Erdogan's opposition, democracy was basically lost. Same thing happened in Russia.
