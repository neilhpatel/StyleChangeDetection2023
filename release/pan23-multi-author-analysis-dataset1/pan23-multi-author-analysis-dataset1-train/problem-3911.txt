Paul first states that women exchange natural sexual relationships for unnatural relationships. Paul then moves on to men who he also claims abandoned natural sexual relationships for unnatural ones. However, in doing so, he draws a parallel or a correlation. That which the men have done is the same as what the women have done, that's why he bridges the two statements with "In the same way." So, he's drawing a direct correlation between what the women did and what the men did. This is a normal rhetorical device. There is no need to repeat the same list of activities twice. Nonetheless, it is safe to understand that all the things he is saying the men were doing he was also saying the women were doing.
Very interesting. Do you know if there is a good general academic study aid to the bible? So one which discusses the imagery and context etc like the above but without espousing too much the religious belief as to what it's saying? If that makes sense.
What do you make of the theory that he's referencing a prior 2nd temple Jewish theory of homosexuality, essentially, "pagans are gay because naked statues are hot and make you have gay thoughts". I'm not sure to what extent I buy the "Paul was a repressed gay man" theory since it seems a little too neat and cherry-pickey to my taste, but it would contextualize how prudish he is even by Christian standards.
