Thats the problem it really dosent. If a infraction is reported by LEO/medical it is sent to state police and on to federal database. At that point you need a pardon or medical rights restoration. The problem is getting all the infractions reported. They vary state by state and some mandatory reporters don't even know or care. We don't have the infrastructure to enforce the regulations we already have. For example what county Office or mental health has the resources to digitize and report legacy infractions dating back to the 80's, they might not even have the records anymore. All this changes state to state and even its different on federal land like a base. We need to fix the system asap.
I do think itâ€™s absolutely reasonable to draw a conclusion that the very outspoken political candidate who has been very outspoken in his views going as far as to wear Kkk hoods, has also been outspoken to his family about those same views m, that we can see in action when the grandchild openly parrots those same views and uses violence including a mass shooting to reinforce those views. You can be silly and pretend otherwise though.

Completely different situation than Kyle Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse acted in self defense when being attacked by violent thugs. What just happened in Colorado was straight up murder by a deranged lunatic.
