Now whether the potential consequences of such a report (if in fact she did look into the file) is personally justifiable is a different question that only OP can answer.
OH I forgot! If/when you report her I wouldask them about changing your information so.sne can't go in there and completely fuck your shit up. Also if you dont report her I would go about changing this information ASAP because you.know she has access and is sharing it with family. Who's to say she won't try to "fix" the damage.
Report Fraud, Waste and Abuse to Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), if you want to report, confidentially, misconduct, waste, fraud, or abuse by an IRS employee or a Tax Professional, you can call 1-800-366-4484 (1-800-877-8339 for TTY/TDD users).
Yeah... I don't understand why she decided to do this? Or why she decided to tell my family? I'd have never known, if my grandpa didn't tell me what my aunt had said to him... I'm at a total loss for words...
If she were bluffing/lying about accessing, there's no harm in raising a suspicion and the internal investigation would be closed without repercussions (maybe a stern talking to regardless).
