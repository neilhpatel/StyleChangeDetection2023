I think the point was missed. I’m not taking a position of the technical feasibility of weaponized lasers. The point is, that racism is not the explanation for why Illhan, with her criticism of Israel, is shown the door whilst MTG is allowed to spread her claims about Jewish space lasers. The explanation is simply that the former is taken seriously whilst the latter is not. Those claiming it is based on racism are gaslighting and very likely serving the same masters as the republicans who showed Illhan the door. Note the author of the linked article is a member of the Israeli tribe.
Completely unnecessary but everyone wins. It elevates Omar’s profile. She’ll raise a crazy amount of money off this. And McCarthy just tossed some red meat to his base. And frankly independents don’t care. She’ll be back at on the Committee when Democrats win control back of the House. Until then all democrats in the House are just twirling their thumbs anyways.
