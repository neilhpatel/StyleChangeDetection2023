The military only had like 24% of the vote last election when they won. There was a third big party that took away too many votes. The third party was forced to disband though so the election this year should be pretty much a landslide against the military junta. I think it’s interesting that they outlawed the third party right after the election. It’s almost like they didn’t want to win.

the UK which has a monarchy. The Palace of Versailles gets more visitors annually than any of the UK palaces or royal sites and we all know what the French did to their kings and queens. People would still go to Buckingham Palace and Windsor and all the other places even without a monarch living in them, because they’re of historical and cultural significance and hold in them vast collections of art, plants and flowers, architectural features.
A __dry__ hunger strike! That's fucking hardcore, and I say that with huge respect. I hope they survive & succeed.
