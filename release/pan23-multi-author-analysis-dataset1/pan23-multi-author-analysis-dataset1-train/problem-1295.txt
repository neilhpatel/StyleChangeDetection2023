"We have seen that formulas expressing omnipotence are typical of hymns and that every god can be hailed as omnipotent in a hymn devoted to his or her divinity. " he also concludes that "Our first conclusion may be that if the Greeks should be ‘desperately alien’ they are not so in that having so many gods they must do without the notion of theological omnipotence, but in that they have so many omnipotent gods." and "This whole argument can be extended to other divine characteristics as we have quickly listed them above, especially to omnipresence and omniscience, including all-seeing.".
... This use can be compared to that of the word ‘soul’, which may refer to ‘all that is soul’, that is\\\, signalling a generic description\\\ of ‘soul’ without for that matter denying the plurality of the various ‘souls’. In the same way, ‘god’ as a singular noun does not refer to one sole god, but rather describes all of the gods in their essential features.
" 'Unique god, without equal': this common invocation of Egyptian gods sounds as monotheistic as anything can be. But just as almost any Egyptian god can be "greatest" ... he can also be "unique"... The apparent contradiction in logic between the epithet "unique" and the many deities to whom it is applied is easily explained. Extended and more precise forms of the epithet make clear it's true referent, which is the unique character of the divine in general. Every Egyptian gods is "unique in his fashion (wˤ ḥr ḫw.f)": there is no other who is the same as him. ...".
However, I'm still a bit unsatisfied about how an individual might have divided their attention between the gods, not necessarily saying they would have denied others. Like, would it be uncommon to "play favorites", as seems to be the case with that broad invokation Ares?
