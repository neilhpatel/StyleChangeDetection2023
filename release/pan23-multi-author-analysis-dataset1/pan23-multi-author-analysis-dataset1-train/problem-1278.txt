That depends on your definition of the word "working". I would posit that it is quite uncertain if we have a possibly flawed translation that interpreted the Hebrew text in a contemporary hellenistic view, and the author of Matthew quoted it because of the availability of the LXX text or if the intended meaning of the gospel is indeed a virgin birth.
Theologically this question is sometimes resolved, mostly in protestant literature, according to the understanding of scripture as a human witness account, as a way for the author to express the divinity of Christ in contemporary terms, a virgin birth being a not uncommon narrative to signify divine providence.(Wiefel, Wolfgang. Das Evangelium nach Matthäus. Berlin: Evang. Verl.-Anst, 1998.) For example there is the narrative, that the Egyptian pharaoh is fathered by the deity (Amun-)Re and also in a hellenistic context, this is quite common.(Ebner, Martin: Vom Versuch, einen hellenistischen Topos zu rejudaisieren : Zwei verschiedene Lesarten der „Jungfrauengeburt“ in Mt 1,18–25. In: "Dies ist das Buch ..." : das Matthäusevangelium ; Interpretationen, Rezeption, Rezeptionsgeschichte ; für Hubert Frankemölle. Paderborn: Schöningh, 2004. 177--202. ).
If the the virginity was a translation error, is it possible that the Catholic church's insistence on it has more to do with protecting its tradition and being unwilling to admit error than actually being concerned with the effect of non-virginity on the teaching of Christ?
And I would argue that right there, the problems start. We have a lot of time and cultural differences between Isaiah, LXX, Matthew for a start.
