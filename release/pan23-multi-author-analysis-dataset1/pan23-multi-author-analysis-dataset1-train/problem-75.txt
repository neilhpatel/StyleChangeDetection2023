Whatever you do, do not talk to them at all, without a lawyer. They can and will try to manipulate you and guilt you into talking. Dont be vague about it, ask for a lawyer directly and keep asking any time they try to talk to you. Dont even small talk with them. That leaves you open for probing.
Unless subpoenaed, witnesses don't typically have an obligation to offer information - unless directly asked. You still don't even have to offer then, because your information is tied to you potentially committing your own crimes - you have the right to not self incriminate (but you have to state that you are utilizing this right when you're declining to state your knowledge). Your information is also very circumstantial and speculative and reads like hearsay - so... Discuss this with a lawyer, if you're asked to give a statement, do so with a lawyer present. You can still get yourself in trouble even if you're only relaying some information... You're not the true source of the information, you heard it from someone else and gave it to the family. You should definitely consult with a lawyer and never lie to the police (this is where pleading the 5th saves you from lying).
