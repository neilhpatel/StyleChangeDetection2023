Did WWI era tanks (specifically the Mark I) have headlights of any kind to assist battle at night? Or would this have exposed the tank like a big “here I am” sign?
Making nuclear weapons small enough to put on rockets, and rockets powerful enough to carry even small nuclear weapons, required considerably more advancements to both nuclear weapons and rockets than was accomplishable during World War II; it would not be done until well into the 1950s (and you need all of those things well in hand before you can imagine putting them on subs; the first sub-launched nuclear-armed missiles were only available in the very late 1950s, and they were very crude). By contrast, long-range heavy bomber technology was at a stage in which it could be used, but even that was at the edge of plausibility (the B-29s that delivered Fat Man and Little Boy were both modified from "stock" B-29s, in that their armor and defenses had been removed to save weight).
2. The are co-latitudinal, distributed east-west,from Rochechouart (France), to Manicouagan and Saint Martin (Canada), Obolon' (Ukraine) and Red Wing (Minnesota USA). Plainfield is way south of that line.
You must also remember that at that point in the war, the Allied strategic bombing of the Home Islands was almost unopposed due to a number of factors, including the Allied technology (high altitude bombers), low resources and manpower shortages for the Japanese.
3. An intact 141 foot tall nickle iron meteorite should have left a mighty big crater, itself. Presumably, it was not carefully lowered into position by UFO's.
