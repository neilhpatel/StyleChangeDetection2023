Because you sue for damages. What damages did you incur that you are suing for? Misuse of taxpayer dollars? Because if that is the case, everyone could sue every politician if they didnt agree with their agendas and the courts would be running 24/7 with the amount of lawsuits related to this. I think the courts have made it clear that unless there are damages that vilate your individual rights or individual harm, you cannot sue the government. So if you have not been individually harmed (Ted Cruz came up to you and punched you in the face) or have had your individual rights violated (Ted Cruz had your phones tapped without reasonable cause), politicians generally have immunity when it comes to their legislative decisions.
