"experts blaming various factors such as demanding work culture, rising costs of living, and stagnating wages for putting people off parenthood. At the same time, the work force is shrinking, raising fears there won‚Äôt be enough workers to support the ballooning elderly population in fields such as health care and home assistance.".
Partially. Became a single father of a special needs child in 2003, and pretty much focused on him entirely. He‚Äôs 22 now about ready to move out. And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúhmph‚Ä¶I‚Äôm alone.‚Äù.
Explain this to me - if everyone hates working long hours, and even those in powerful/wealthy positions can see that an ageing population and crashing birthrate are bad news, who exactly is maintaining this 'culture' and why aren't people collectively fighting/destroying it?
Yeah, that'll do it. Why would anyone work in health care and home assistance when it's going to be a grueling, underpaid job? It's almost as if there's maybe something wrong with the system as a whole. Just maybe. ü§î.
