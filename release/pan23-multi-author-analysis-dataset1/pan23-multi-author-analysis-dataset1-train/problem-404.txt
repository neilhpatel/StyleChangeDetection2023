I think that alcohol placement should be significantly more discrete in places that aren't dedicated to selling alcohol, like convenience stores or grocery stores.
That is great. Does that include television commercials. They show them over and over. Beautiful people, huge steaks, everyone laughing and smiling. But they donâ€™t show the person crying because they lost their home.
Just saying that while the current system benefits those who rely on ad revenue, the ad revenue itself shapes the product more than the product itself, including those smaller market or independent entertainers, rather than the consumers having direct influence on the type of entertainment being made.
Ok? Just because people are addicted to other things doesn't make my statement about vices invalid. I'd be ok with all advertising ban but that will never happen.
I think all vice advertising should be banned. People with alcoholic, smoking, and gambling addictions should be able to live their lives without it constantly in their face.
