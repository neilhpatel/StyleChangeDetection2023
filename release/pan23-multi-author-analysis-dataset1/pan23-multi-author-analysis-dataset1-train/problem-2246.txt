He is a true believer from what I’ve seen. Not in what he says but in the ends justify the means kind of way. He believes America would be better as a white Protestant nation and he is very good at saying that without saying that. There are a lot of Americans who believe a version of this but know it’s immoral and anti democratic, Tucker gives them the path to embracing that part of themselves and the rhetoric to defend it by dehumanizing minorities and playing to natural rural vs city xenophobia. Or that’s my take, im no expert.
