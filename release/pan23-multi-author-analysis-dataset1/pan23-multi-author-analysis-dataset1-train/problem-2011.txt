Prior responses have pointed out the absolute quantity of arable land between modern China and modern India does not diverge heavily. I wish to elaborate. If we look at a modern map of Chinese population density such as , we see a general pattern â€“ population is concentrated on the river systems, and particularly in the region between the lower Yellow, Yanze and Beihe Rivers (see ), with some additional areas around the Liao river in Manchuria, the Pearl River in the deep south and parts of the upper Yanze in Sichuan. I've taken the liberty of so you can see what I mean.
Fascinating! However I would like to question your first sentence. Even if we dismiss percentages and go by absolute agricultural land, shouldn't India still have far more agricultural land than China? India, while smaller than China, is still a large country. Also, historical India included the extremely fertile lands of Bangladesh and the less fertile but still substantial lands of Pakistan.
Interesting! Can you explain why so many ppl in India live just south of the Himalaya mountain range? Increased rainfall due to the mountains? Other factors?
Chinese traders have been occasionally trading with the Taiwan aboriginals for thousands of years and the Sui Dynasty sent three expeditions around the area of Taiwan and Okinawa (we don't know if they ever landed on Taiwan but most historians believe they only landed on Penghu, a small island like 140km from Taiwan), but none had permanent settlements on Taiwan. It's estimated the total Han-Chinese population on the island before the Dutch came was only around 1,500 people, mostly transient traders.
It was Taiwan becoming a Dutch and Spanish colony that really opened the island up before mass Han migration. "Ilha Formosa", the common name for the island of Taiwan literally means "beautiful island" in Portuguese. The first commercial post, opened up by the Dutch East India Company, was in .
