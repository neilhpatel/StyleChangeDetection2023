To add one small element in support of r/PSUProfOnGrindr’s analysis about the importance of what kind of eloquence was taught in any particular era, probably the most influential American schoolbook of the first half of the 19th century was Caleb Bingham’s The Columbian Orator, whose subtitle announced that it was “calculated to improve youth and others in the ornamental and useful art of eloquence.” A Boston educator, Bingham published the work in 1797, and it rapidly went through about 23 editions. (It was a sequel to his earlier textbook, The American Preceptor: Being a Selection of Lessons for Reading and Speaking, which likewise sold several hundred thousand copies and was still being taught in 1875.).
Taking all of this into consideration, the question that then emerges is: “Did people actually write better/more eloquently in the past, or do we just think that they did because: 1) much of the now accepted shorthand that was used informally at the time hadn’t bled into formal use yet, and does not appear in the sources we tend to access, 2) their writing seems more formal/correct because it’s in an older grammar/diction/syntax, 3) familiarity has led us to negatively perceive our own everyday grammar/diction/syntax, and 4) only the most formal register of writing was likely to be preserved and subsequently published/made accessible to us?”.

This is an interesting question - not because your premise is necessarily right or wrong (though I do believe it to be incorrect) but because it forces us to dig into the nature of language, the idea of the well-written (or what that means to us - in our time and place - in prose anyway), the composition of the archive, and our notions of our own writing. I want to address these points, and then use a few historical examples. I believe that, by the end of this, you will think differently about the premise of your question.
