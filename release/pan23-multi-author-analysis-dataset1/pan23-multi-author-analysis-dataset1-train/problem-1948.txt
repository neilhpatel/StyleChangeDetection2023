But you have to go after Fauci. He’s pretty much the same as Josef Mengele, because you know, that one time the Home Depot told Uncle Cooter he had to wear a mask, but then didn’t make him do it, but just the idea of it made Uncle Cooter feel like he was the most oppressed person to have ever lived. So yeah Fauci is just like Josef Mengele.
When republicans shifted to their apathetic covid response which is proven to be directly responsible for tens or even hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths of US CITIZENS, I was personally horrified and disgusted and these feelings of tribal disgust towards these people have not faded in the least. I am certain that my view will be correct historically when the dust settles on all this and these appalling actions of so called public servants can be viewed in an objective light. The most important job of a public servant is to make sure as many of us stay alive as possible and people like DeSantis were running point as the most notorious offender towards the safety of his constituents.
