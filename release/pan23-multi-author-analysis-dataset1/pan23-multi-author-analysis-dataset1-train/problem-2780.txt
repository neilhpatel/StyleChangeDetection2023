There's a substantive difference between "I refuse to serve you because you're [insert religion here]," and "Being exposed to your higher risk of COVID because you are unvaccinated is not a reasonable accommodation I'm willing to make.".
Also, accommodations for not getting the vaccine have to be reasonable, and there may not be an accommodation possible depending on the type of business or job that you're in. It's not a black and white answer.
There are government agencies that protect against various forms of discrimination including discrimination on religious grounds. For you to seek the protection of one of those agencies you would need to establish both that you have a legitimate religious position that is impacted, and that the entity discriminating against you could reasonably do otherwise.
No one is telling you that. But for an exemption to the vaccine, it has to be a sincerely held religious belief, and just making something up and saying "my religion says this" isn't going to pass the smell test for many things.
Is this hypothetical, or do you actually have a religious exemption for the vaccine? Note that there are only six religions with actual religious beliefs about vaccines and they are very small denominations.
