The fourth jump, the pond, caused the most discussion. Of 46 horses who jumped into the pond, 18 fell, and 10 unhorsed their riders without falling themselves ; 18 horses came through the pond smoothly and with no faults. Three of these had refused once to attempt the jump. The pond was drained on the day after the test to determine whether holes, unevenness, stones or other peculiarities of the ground could have caused the many falls. It was found that the ground had no faults, no holes or hollows, but that it was a little higher on the left side, so that the water was more shallow there. This, however, did not affect the falls. Just as many of the horses who landed on the left side had fallen as of those who landed in the middle or the right portion of the pond. We cannot entirely explain the secret of not falling, of passing through smoothly. It is certain only that those riders were most successful at the pond who were going very slowly before they jumped, who.
The water jump was shown at the preparatory event leading up to the Olympics albeit without a hurdle.
Ah, interesting. Thanks very much for that! So not actually invented there but still very, very new and possibly not known outside central Europe?
