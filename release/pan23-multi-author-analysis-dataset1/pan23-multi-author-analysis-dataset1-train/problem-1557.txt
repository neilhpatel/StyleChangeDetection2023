It's certainly fair to claim that the revolution was "bourgeois" in the sense that it preserved the existing power of wealthy elites - indeed it could be argued that they gained economically by no longer being forced into trade policies designed to benefit the British Empire - and in the sense that many of the most prominent revolutionaries (George Washinon, Jefferson, John Hancock) came from wealthy backgrounds. Having said that, there were still reasons for 'ordinary' Americans to support independence.
Secondly, the actions of the British did a lot to encourage 'ordinary' Americans to resist British rule. The King's rejection of American attempts at reconciliation - such as the Olive Branch Petition - and the outbreak of violence, for example the destruction of Falmouth, Maine, and Norfolk, Virginia severed the belief amongst Americans that they should remain loyal subjects, and legitimised in their minds the struggle for independence, as a last resort as opposed to something sought from the beginning of resistance to colonial rule.
