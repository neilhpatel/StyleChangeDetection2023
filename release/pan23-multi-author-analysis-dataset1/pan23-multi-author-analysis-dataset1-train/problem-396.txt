I agree. But the idea in of itself is completely absurd one - there are a number of reasons I think that but maybe the most obvious one is a question in what she thinks would happen if red and blue states did separate into individual countries? Red country just has a "Republican" party and the Blue country just has a "Democratic" party? Nope. As long as elections are still held for political office then factions of parties would appear and compete and would ultimately boil itself down to two major parties again and we would end up in pretty much the same place in both countries. This means that if one of the countries (not gonna point fingers here) wanted to avoid this inevitable situation then they would have to eliminate the democratic process and essentially have a dictator. If the "red" country wants to be purely Republican then they would end up a Fascist regime since basically the Republican Party is all that matters and all within the country must submit to it.
Sounds good. You can have your red State shit holes that have been relying on Federal government assistance for generations. We will keep the billions in tax revenue generated from blue States and let you figure it out. Have fun!
