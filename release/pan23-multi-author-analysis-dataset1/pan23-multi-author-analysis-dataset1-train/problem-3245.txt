The number of actual home owners in this country do not collectively generate enough wealth to fund the federal government. The federal government does not collect taxes on property.
Federal once collected tax on wealth and property. So, people with little property paid little tax. People today, with loads of debt, would pay zero taxes, where as billionaires would pay a shit ton in taxes. The amount of tax was based on the real and theoretical (market) value of property and not limited to land, but included all tangible and intangible assets. Professional government employed assessors would determine the value of all this property and compute the taxes owed.
I'm also ok with this. Back in the roman times veterans were given a plot of land as their retirement. The feds have been buying up a lot of property as of late, they can let some of it go. Let's go with 1 acre per vet.
