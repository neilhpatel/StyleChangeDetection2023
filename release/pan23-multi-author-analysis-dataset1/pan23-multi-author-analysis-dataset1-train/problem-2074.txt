“The complete collapse of the Thwaites itself could lead to sea level rise of more than two feet (70 centimeters), which would be enough to devastate coastal communities around the world. But the Thwaites is also acting like a natural dam to the surrounding ice in West Antarctica, and scientists have estimated global sea level could ultimately rise around 10 feet if the Thwaites collapsed.”.

Energy independence is a national security issue. You don't want to depend on Russia, the Middle East, etc.
Let's hope there's no ancient virus in those glaciers that would come out from some sort of hibernation and be released into the seas contaminating all sea life, even the plankton leading to a major loss of food source for us and causing some sort of imbalance in ecosystem where creatures that live both in sea and fresh water bring that disease inland and eventually cause a total collapse of said ecosystem 😀.
