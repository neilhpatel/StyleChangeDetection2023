What the attorney means by this is that they're not triggering the conflict of interest rules that inherently come with creating an attorney-client relationship. Put another way, because they are only reviewing documents for you they're not getting enough information about you to disqualify them from representing any other party affiliated with these documents in the future, nor are they disqualifying themselves from possibly representing someone taking legal action against you in the future.
Now, saying they're not creating this privilege and actually not creating this privilege when the facts are reviewed are two entirely different things, and just because they give this warning doesn't mean they wouldn't be disqualified by a court from representing someone in the future opposing you on a case. But by putting it out there, they ensure that if you try to argue you thought you had created a relationship like that with them you'd be forced to admit that you were warned.
Interesting..! Thank you for your insight. I guess it does then concern me that I'm sending all my documents which contain all kinds of info about myself and some of my family member -- not any less than what a lawyer that I'd actually hire for representation would know. I don't know if that makes any less/more likely for them to be disqualified to take legal actions against my favor.
