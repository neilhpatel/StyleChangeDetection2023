Mastercard and Stripe’s financial partners have regulations about what products and services cannot be processed on their networks and a violation of these regulations is subject to substantial fines. Examples of violations include selling copyrighted products without authorization or selling pharmaceuticals without proper verification.
What is your business? What products are you selling? If they made an error on their end, a simple phone call or email will give you the solution. However, if the products you were selling were copyrighted, you will likely get a fee. Call them and ask.
You should consult with a local attorney with experience in e-commerce\contracts\international law. You will probably\possibly also need to consult an attorney in the US and a solicitor in the UK. You are way outside of this forum's paygrade. Is it possible that the email is a scam? $425,000 on $170,000 doesn't sound right.
When you signed up to Stripe you agreed to the Stripe Services Agreement, which states that your business is immediately responsible for ‘any Fees, Fines, Disputes, Reversals, Returns, or any other liability we incur that results from your use of Payment Services’ \[1\].
