Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack Weatherford is a good book to learn about Genghis Khan and his successors. it also covers the Toluid Civil War and the reign of Kublai Khan. There are also several translations of the Secret History of the Mongols available online for downloading. The link to the one I read can be found .
Also true I definitely tend to lean hard into the the "aw, but their love of intellectual debate Their patronage of art and literature Their interest in science" side of things, because that's still just so under-emphasized in popular understanding - and even in academic understanding, if you tend to hang out with a bunch of Arabists. But if people weren't always pushing so hard in the other direction, I'd be talking a lot more about the unarguable violence of their conquest. Instead, I end up getting mad at because just about the ONLY specific thing that's reported in the sources about the dude's relationship with women is that he WASN'T jealous and suspicious after his wife was abducted, and didn't care that people said his firstborn son might not be his. Was he also, on the other hand, a rapist? I'd be beyond shocked if he wasn't - but everyone already assumes that, so I don't get as worried about informing them.
