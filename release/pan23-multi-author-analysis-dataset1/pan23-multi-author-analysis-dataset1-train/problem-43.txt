This really unfortunate and poorly thought out article neglects to mention Brave Sir Josh Hawley who fled the scene of the insurrection after supporting it, who many Missourians feel should not be in the seat anymore (although many support his chicanery) it’s probably going to be close but I would say it’s likely we could see a flip here in mo.
I agree it's tiresome. Most of the people who are constantly posting doom and gloom are the same ones who said that Trump was going to win in 2020 and that Republicans were going to win the Senate and the house by a landslide in the midterms. Nobody knows what's going to happen in future elections. Electoral politics change a lot more often than people ever realize, or want to admit. The 90's weren't all that long ago, and Bill Clinton won multiple southern states, but people automatically give those states to republicans now, except as we saw in 2020 democrats were able to win a southern state in the presidential election that most people thought of as impossible.
