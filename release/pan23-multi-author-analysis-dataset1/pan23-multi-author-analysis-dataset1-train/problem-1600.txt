Mainstream Republicans are afraid of Trump's voters which are their voters also. This became apparent right after January 6th when none of them came out publicly against Trump because they realized very quickly that the voters didn't care that their own invaded the capital and killed people. McConnell made a miscalculation. He has stated that he thought that Trump was done after January 6th and that everyone would reject him. This is why he did not vote to remove him from office. It would damage the party too much. He was wrong. The voters didn't care. Now if they don't let Trump win the nomination, Trump will start his own party and Republicans will lose everything in 2024.

Just the fact that the GOP leadership did not hold a press conference unanimously rejecting Trumpâ€˜s behavior having dinner with an anti-Semite and Nazi, calling for banning the Constitution, and the pending case against Trump for taking, concealing and lying about top-secret documents, putting our national security at risk, speaks volumes.
