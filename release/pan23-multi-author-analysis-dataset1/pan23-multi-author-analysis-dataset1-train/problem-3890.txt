My comment stands. Charges for murdering and torturing people says nothing about whether or not authorities support the environment, so summarizing it as a win for the environment is both an unfounded claim, as well as an insensitive one to their families/supporters who almost assuredly see this first and foremost as a heinous crime against their loved ones rather than nature.
I can't. not anymore. I dont belong on this side of your fenced in chemical orgy. I dont even care if I'm blamed by the people for coming from this nightmare factory, I just cant do this anymore. When you come to a point where you don't believe in the direction and aims of your country, what do you do? Where do you go? I'm not fighting anyone but I am happy to be a human shield against the mindless violence my people inflict on the world as if they're doing it a favour.
Rhetorical questions. My thoughts are that poverty needs to be addressed. There is nary a better motivator than hunger.
Enjoy extinction. From what I've seen, it's a fog of nightmares that settles in and leaves nothing but parasites and decomp behind. Silence except for the chewing of termites, all so we could play Jetsons for a human lifetime. Nice job.
I can't speak for deathsquads but typically for "enforcement" not only are they at risk everyday to protect you, they're also subject to prosecution post-event following investigation, so I disagree again as this is not some lawless wild west cowboy sherif (though it could certainly apply to some countries, but as reasonable human beings we'd expect that there would be some policy in place).
This is it, you see. What we've spread around the world isn't hope for something better, it is the fire of greed and industry that consumes it. We're just really good at marketing. So good, we don't even call "marketing" what it is; lying to support a narrative to makes you keen to buy in. This is a jenga tower built on the lie that jenga towers never fall and you're all living it.
