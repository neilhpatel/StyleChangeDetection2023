Unless your lease states otherwise, your landlord has no right to enter your unit except to 1) make repairs that you have requested or 2) an emergency. Does your lease state that your landlord has the right to enter to make whatever renovations he wants?
Right now you have the obligation to pay June rent, and the landlord has no right to enter the unit (unless otherwise agreed under the lease). Any other arrangements are a negotiation with the landlord. Take extensive photographs and video of the apartment in its current condition. Then call your landlord and tell him you can be out by May 31st if he will prorate the rent. Otherwise, he can wait to renovate until your lease is over. I assume the lease break fee would be more than one months rent? You can compromise from there.
>Access: Before accessing the Property, Landlord or anyone authorized by Landlord will attempt to first contact Tenant, but may enter the Property at reasonable times without notice to make repairs or to show the Property to prospective tenants or buyers, inspectors, fire marshals, lenders, appraisers, or insurance agents. Additionally, Landlord or anyone authorized by Landlord may peacefully enter the Property at reasonable times without first attempting to contact Tenant and without notice to: (1) survey or review the Property’s condition and take photographs to document the condition; (2) make emergency repairs; (3) exercise a contractual or statutory lien; (4) leave written notices; or (5) seize nonexempt property if Tenant is in default.
Oh, sorry I misunderstood what you meant. What repairs are you planning to do yourself? I completely agree with you that the landlord shouldn’t be in your unit renovating while you pay for utilities and rent. And a new tenant certainly shouldn’t be living there.
