To what degree other people believed in witches... It wasn't universal, but many did, and Macbeth was right in the height of English/Scottish witch hunts. The shift to Protestantism actually made it a bit worse, in the view of most historians, coinciding with new witchcraft laws from James I in 1605. There is actually a hoax regarding a young girl named Anne Gunter whose father coached her, that got up to the Star Chamber and James himself. It fell apart and she and her father were charged. (This actually might have been gossip that was swirling about as Shakespeare wrote Macbeth, lining up with the usual dates of his writing/performance.).
Thanks to Henry VII’s line of succession rules, Edward’s eschewing them, Lady Jane Gray, Mary I, and Elizabeth I being all dead lines, the Crown went to the next male heir: James VI of Scotland, descendant of Banquo.
Okay, so. Macbeth is very much a piece made for James I. James I really, really believed in witches. He also believed that he was a target for witches, to the degree that he deeply suspected that witches were trying to prevent his marriage, leading to the North Berwick witch trials. He wrote a book on the subject, Daemonologie, that was republished when he took the English throne in 1603.
