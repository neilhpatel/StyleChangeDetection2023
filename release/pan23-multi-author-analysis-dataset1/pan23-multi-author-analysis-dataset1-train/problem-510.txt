Expectations does not equal capability. These instruments aren't working better than they are capable of, that would be impossible. However, there's a lot of variables that may alter the capabilities of these instruments (think vibrations of rocket, deployment, insertion accuracy that can alter the performance of these instruments etc) and it turns out that those variables had minimal impact.
Or so i've read. I'm not an expert. I just have google and was curious a while back. May or may not apply to gas worlds. Periods of specific activity may create false positives, but seem to recall the article saying those are usually brief, geologically speaking.
Yeah. Basically it's Oxygen and other compounds usually created by life. But there is not a 100% "It's life" test, because those chemicals can also be created by other non-organic methods. The combination of detected "signs of life" would be a strong candidate, but never a certainty. Then scientists will spend next 50 or so years looking at the planet and doing more tests and maybe one day manifest "yeah, it's probably life." It's gonna be slow burn.
You're severely understimating our capabilities. Making an array of telescopes in a large enough area would allow us to resolve far away objects pretty easily. We already do this here on earth, and even as we circle the sun, now imagine if we managed to get telescopes in an array much larger than our straight path around the sun.
