Many people here are talking about encryption and security as if they know absolutely anything. Encryption exists to so you don't have to trust centralized services. However the Twitter protocol is closed source and there's no guarantee that your messages arnt being double read by storage services AND point to point. Let alone another million vulnerabilities.
No. The code to encrypt messages does not need to be hidden to do its job. The only thing that needs to be private are the private keys generated by the code - unique to each user - to decrypt messages using the code and the recipients public key.
Absolutely! It's almost like people think "encryption" is a magic key to data security. Clearly they never worked as an information/operations security roles.
I haven't used Twitter since 2014. The business I work for doesn't use it either. I have no problem living a Twitter-less life. I know a lot of folks and businesses are going to be impacted and I'm sorry for that. But it's Twitter. What was the long term plan?
