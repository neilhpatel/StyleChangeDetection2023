This is a really interesting question! I am not sure if I will be able to provide information about every image but I can hopefully shed some light on what the purpose of this document was and why it contains such a seemingly baffling array of lesser-known and out of place sects.
2. Normally, these beliefs were referred to as Antinomianism, antinomian meaning "without the law." Again, there is plenty of theological precedent in arguing that a spiritually perfect person would have no need of laws, as they would live entirely by the "law" of love. What made someone an antinomian was hard to pin down, as many people accused one another of antinomianism polemically. For example, Martin Luther frequently had to defend himself from charges of antinomianism for teaching that a person is saved by grace through faith, apart from works of the law, even as he himself wrote treatises against others for their supposed antinomianism, such as Johannes Agricola. Perhaps the most definitive antinomian tenets were that the law had no use, theological or otherwise, for Christians, and that Christians were thus not bound to follow moral law and did not need it taught or preached to them.
2.	Evin: Would you mind elaborating on the Welsh messiah claimant named Evins? Someone claiming to be the second coming of Christ in Early Modern period England sounds fascinatingly heretical. Did this man have followers? Iâ€™m assuming that he was executed for heresy or blasphemy? Did he or his followers leave any writings?
