Bottero's is by far the best introduction to Mesopotamian religion, but is still well worth a read. Oppenheim's section on "Why a 'Mesopotamian Religion' should not be written" in (free PDF) is also a classic.
Ancient Egyptian religion is a very complex subject, and no single book can do the subject justice. I provided a lenhy list of reading suggestions .
Herodotus’ Histories is quite fascinating, the main narrative is that of the Greco-Persian Wars in the 5th century BC, but the first half of Herodotus’ text is concerned with providing an extensive account on the rise of the Persian Empire (especially the life of Cyrus the Great), and the history and culture of various nations conquered by the Persian Empire (Herodotus dedicates the entirety of book two of the Histories to the geography, practices, and history of ancient Egypt, from its first Pharaoh, until the Persian conquest by Cambyses II). Herodotus provides a fascinating Greek perspective of the Persians, Scythians, and Egyptians. You should be cautious at times when reading Herodotus, however, as his history becomes much less reliable the farther back in time his narrative goes.
If you’re looking for general history, the writings of I would recommend the writings of Herodotus and Thucydides\.\.
