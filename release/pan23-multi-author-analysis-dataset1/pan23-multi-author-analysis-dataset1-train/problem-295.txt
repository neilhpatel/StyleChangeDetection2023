Now USA, a Super PAC that has supported Republican candidates, is encouraging voters to do just that: asking voters in paid advertisements to "honor her contributions to the grassroots cannabis movement.".
Maybe they are sick of both sides where no matter who wins, civilians will be killed across the world to feed the military industrial complex, government welfare will be given out to large corporations in the tune of trillions of dollars, freedoms will be stripped until normal citizens with no recourse to return said rights, and a continued effort to strip this country of everything that we are taught made it great.
That's not what happens. They don't look at the candidate who came in third place and say, "I should be more like the even bigger loser." Instead, what they do is look at the policies of the winning candidate (in this scenario, the Republican), and say, "I should be more like the one who won.".
