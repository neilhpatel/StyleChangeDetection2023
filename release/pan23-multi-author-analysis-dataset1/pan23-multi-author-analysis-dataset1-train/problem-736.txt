Oh and another good one is when they say "you're more likely to hurt yourself with a gun". I get it that saying "I'm built different" is snarky, but not being a fucking moron and not being needlessly violent is actually incredibly simple. Honestly, even though I sleep with a gun by my bedside every night, my firearms are one of the most controllable risk factors in my daily life. I'm more likely to get killed or mauled in a way so horrible I'd ask for death at work with the heavy equipment strewn about. I could do everything right at work and still get killed Monday because someone launched a chuck key using a lathe.
"Canadian government anticipates angry population in coming years, begins measures to protect itself.".
Legitimate hunting, which serves a very practical purpose of controlling overpopulation, and safety from dangerous wild animals are very valid reasons to have rifles and shotguns. If it were up to me, I would only allow bolt-action rifles and break open shotguns for these two concerns, and they would be very highly regulated and controlled.
Absolutely shameful pandering. We can do better things with our resources like try to get basic government functions such as healthcare, passport offices, and immigration to work. My country is falling apart at the seams and they are dickinâ€™ around trying to take hunting equipment.
