I don't know which of the two makes me want to throw up more. A Jordan or McCarthy speaker, both are horrible people, both voted against certifying the election results, both will spend every waking day obstructing anything meaningful and spend countless hours investigating the investigations and Hunter Biden.
I don't think it matters a whole lot. None of them seem equipped to be speaker, can you imagine any of them trying to build a consensus, or compromise with Democrats to get legislation passed, and so on? You may dislike Pelosi or Beohner, and certainly disagree with at least one them regarding their politics, but they were the right person for the job and got legislation passed. Any of the names floated recently just seem hopeless for the job.
