In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Sickening. No matter how good or bad a politician is, getting a lifetime pension after a single term is basically welfare, except it's a lot more money.

Well Republicans. You thought were going to empower yourselves following the great sociopath and backing the indefensible. Got news for you all. Even if a speaker is elected this clown show of chaos will continue to pick up speed. More and more Americans will grow to loathe you and see through you.
