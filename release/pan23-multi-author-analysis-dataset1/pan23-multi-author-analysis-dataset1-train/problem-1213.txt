In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes. But all of what you say depends on free and fair elections as the natural consequences leading to their political marginalization. We're dealing with people who only believe in democracy if they win, will cheat or use violence and threats of violence to "win", and who are heavily armed and have thoroughly infiltrated the military and police.
Nice try. We didn't have unified government during Trump. Pelosi still was calling the shots in the House and the filibuster is not allowed on budget bills.

Also, Republicans consistently poll terribly among Millennials and Gen Z, who see Cons as scary, bigoted, and hostile to every political policy (climate change, taxing the wealthy, government funded healthcare, corporate accountability, etc) both demographics care about. Not to mention the Cons offer these demographics absolutely nothing of worth, policy wise. This could change if they move toward the Left and start trying to be real policy makers, but they had that chance after Romney lost to Obama and chose to double-down on BS.
