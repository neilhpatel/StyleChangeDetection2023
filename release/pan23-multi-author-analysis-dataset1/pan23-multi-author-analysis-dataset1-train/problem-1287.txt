Their tampering with the Voting Rights Act is blatantly Unconstitutional as the Constitution clearly and unequivocally gives the Congress overriding Authority over how elections are done.
This thread is bizarre to me. None of that has anything to do with the simple fact that Amy Barrett Comey is a woman and Clarence Thomas is black. Pretending that all the ills of the Supreme Court are simply down to old white men is simply foolish.
But I guess we can simple excuse the terrible things they do as they are only capable of following their orders from old white men, right?
The comment I replied to has no bearing on anything whatsoever, but apparently I'm the asshole for not wanting to excuse her terrible behavior as simply being at the behest of old white men.
It's honestly gross how many people in this thread seem deadset on the idea that somehow old white men are the source of all evil and any women or minorities who go along with it are simply doing so because that's what old white men want.
Are we really pretending like women and black people can't simply be bad people on their own without input from old white men?
It's incredible how many people in this thread are taking a borderline misogynistic/racist view on this by trying to reduce Amy Comey Barrett and Clarence Thomas down to simply being proxies for white men. Are they not both capable of making their own decisions? Why should the terrible things they do be excused as simply them doing the behest of their white male overlords?
