In your situation, since you were there and allowed them to enter the home to gather their belongings, it would not be trespassing.
Entering your home without permission, except to address an emergency situation, would be trespassing. You can deny entry if the landlord does not provide the 24 hours notice.
Truly appreciate the response. I will 100% let him know how uncomfortable it made me by opening it the door and coming into my entry way. Kind of made me feel that he would have just walked in without anybody home. I have a camera from my last apartment and I’m prob going to set it up pointing at the front door just in case he decides he’s missing anything else. This landlord in particular has been notorious for taking advantage of our kindness (I.e planting flowers when our only obligating is to mow, repairing things in the house for free ect) so I truly feel as though he feels incredibly entitled to access to the property.
No problem. I do find it unusual for a landlord to store personal belongings in a house he doesn't live in... Do you know what he stores in the closet, does he actually walk out with things?
