If your lawyer doesn't understand the tech aspect well enough to give advice, the lawyer needs to consult with someone who knows the tech aspect better. A second opinion is definitely a good idea if possible.
Regardless. The most obvious option would have been to temporarily quit playing that game, which every other lawyer would first tell you as well. But since thats not happening, you will have to somehow prove that this game is significantly important enough to you to be an essential recreational activity for you with high value for your mental health, without having to go into therapy for online game addictionðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜….
You in Europe? Gdpr could be useful to get logs and proof. Afterwards you need proof that your ex is owner of her handle name. And at least with that you can prove that you were in that guild before her.
Basically this. The lawyer doesn't understand the technology well, but his advice is the safest practical advice a lawyer could give, even with an understanding of how Discord/guilds work. Technically yes, OP is doing nothing wrong and technically yes, he should be able to keep chatting in discord and elsewhere so long as he's not trying to chat with his ex. Technically there are good arguments to be made that an RO should be changed or thrown out because of her behavior and with the right evidence and the right judge that could happen.
