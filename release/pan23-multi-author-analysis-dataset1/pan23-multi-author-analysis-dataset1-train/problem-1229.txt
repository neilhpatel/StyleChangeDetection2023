Something is wrong with their brains. I knew a lady for 15 years , babysat her kids almost daily for a year when they were small. Then trump happened and the last phone call I had w her, she was spitting into the phone about how trump was so great yada yada. Spitting… angry. That’s only happened a few times in my whole life. And of course she pretty rich which makes sense. White evangelical rich lady loves her Cheeto, no matter how morally decrepit he is.
The invading country who is mad that the country they are invading is defending itself better than they can attack, and said defending country has almost doubled its military weaponry purely from capturing the attacking country's attacking weapons, and the attacking country is economically falling apart because it decided to wage a war it couldn't win in 3 days and is on the verge of collapse 11 months later.
I believe this. It’s just surfaced now. Our society is so divided. So unequal. I’m hanging out just wasting time, Bc of the huge blizzard outside and even watching “the crown” ( netflix) is getting hard bc I despise rich ppl so much. Why do the Brits even allow “ royalty” anymore when their own ppl are hungry. The rich think they are entitled to the vast majority of their wealth but most of it, no. It’s basically stolen. In the US,( where I am), poor ppl who support MAGA, the GOP and Trump just baffle me. I’m rambling … I’ll go. But yea, I agree, it’s a cesspool alright.
