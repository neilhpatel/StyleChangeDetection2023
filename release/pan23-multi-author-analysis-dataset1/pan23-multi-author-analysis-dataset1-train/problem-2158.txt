During long-term unconscious illnesses in times before catheters, how was elimination handled? Did the patient remain on an uncomfortable bedpan 24 hours a day? While semi-conscious patients could be helped to a chamber pot or indicate their need for elimination, how were comatose and severely ill patients handled in this regard, if they were not conscious enough to communicate?
Its legitimate. It was published by Princeton UP, and Knight is a recognized authority on the Soviet secret police. I would put it down to bad design, but the content itself is solid.
Absolutely! To an extent this kind of question defies a single source as it's the kind of knowledge one acquires over a period of discovery and it is largely still under debate but I have a few here that would serve well.
Interesting. Looking back at the source given on the Wikipedia page, the information about the guilty plea stems from the autobiography of Allan McLane Hamilton, the psychiatrist who gave evidence about his sanity during the trial. Not being a legal professional, maybe he thought that staying silent carried the same connotations as they would have in English common law.
