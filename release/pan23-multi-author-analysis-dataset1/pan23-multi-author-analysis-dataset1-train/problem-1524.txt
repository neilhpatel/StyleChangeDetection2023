Yes, most of the early settlers to New France were men. The few women who came had to pay their own passage, not necessarily an easy task for single women in the 1600s, even if they were inclined to the hardships. In the mid part of the 17th century, concerns were raised that the colony was not viable due to population size and lack of growth. A letter from Jean Talon (at the time, the Intendant of New France) stated, "send us strong, intelligent and beautiful girls of robust health, habituated to farm work.".
These include the devastation of FN communities by disease; the displacement of FN communities from the St Lawrence River Valley, where the majority of French Canadians lived, to further and further marginal lands; and the eventual placement of FN peoples on reserves, many of which are far away from lands where the majority of whites lived.
When the Kings Daughters arrived, how did they go about finding a husband? Was there a courting process? did men or the women pick and choose? Some other scenario?
There is talk in Canadian history as well about the idea of the "revenge of the cradle;" that until the 1950s, high birth rates were encouraged among French Canadians as a matter of national pride and ensuring their cultural survival and place in Canadian and North American society. I'm wary of this as an explanation because I can't find sources on it from the time, even though it is a popular explanation. It seems more likely to me that rather than being an intentional thing, this was a side effect of Quebecois culture that was later seized upon by nationalists. If anyone wants to expand on this idea, go ahead.
