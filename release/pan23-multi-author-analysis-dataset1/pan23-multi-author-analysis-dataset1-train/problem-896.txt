The end result (which they taught me — probably more structuralist/semiotic +Bakhtin?) would be to basically work on dissecting the text as a cultural object, taking note both of its context (when it was written) and of the context of its reading (when I am reading and analyzing it), where the author necessarily becomes just one of the cultural influences on text, or an "operator" of literary devices, not a holy demiurge you presume to "talk with" directly, like for critics before.
Now, the New Critics would have rejected Barthes. For example, Eliot was a great proponent of the importance of understanding all the author had done to that point before drawing a judgement on the work. They did not reject the idea of authorial intent. However, the New Critics weren’t scholars in the modern sense ⁠— they were mostly literary critics trying to pass judgment on works, whether or not the art worked. But their methods and ideas get picked up by scholars and students, who love this new and engaging way of working with texts. This had to be a very exciting moment ⁠— you go from cataloguing all of Keats’s influences and sticking the resulting encyclopedia on a shelf to actually working with the poems themselves, trying to grasp them and understand them in a really complex and nuanced way.
