Ostrowski, Donald & Marshall Poe (eds.). Portraits of Old Russia: Imagined Lives of Ordinary People, 1300-1745. London: Routledge, 2011: Though it is technically not a academic research work, it may be very interesting to read for the better understanding in pre-modern Russian society. It is actually a collective (pseudo-) biographies written by the specialists of pre-modern Russia, based on their research on the primary sources and the academic literature. Ostrowski is now almost the only very active Anglo-Phone researcher in Russian history, from the 15th to the 17th century, so his other books are also worth checking.
Sorry, 16th century Russian history is primarily out of my scope and I knew neither Russian (as a language) much nor much about the Russian historiographical trend on them in the 21th century.
: While it is a bit dry, it is in fact only the affordable and the most accessible choice for later Middle Ages under 'the yoke of the Tatars' to early Muscovite period in Russian History (the author originally specializes in socio-economic history).
P.S. big shout out to sengaku for linking Notes upon Russia, I'd never heard of that before. Tearing into now...
, written by the ambassador of the Habsburgs, Sigismund von Herberstein who visited Moscovy in person, is also a very valuable account of Russia during the period you asked in OP, though we should also take his bias into consideration.
