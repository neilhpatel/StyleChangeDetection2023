There were aspects of this that were both complicated and petty, on all sides. He was officially, at one point, King of Greece, which was a constitutional monarchy but did not have a merely ceremonial monarch at the time, and he didn't treat it simply as ceremonial, getting himself quite embroiled in political messes while being quite politically inept. Much of his life, even after being deposed, was heavily affected by political and diplomatic machinations involving him. There were significant impediments to him living a normal life, and in some sense, his grifting was one of the clearer options for him after being exiled. He was not simply part of the extensive worldwide royal-roleplaying community of descendants who style themselves with titles long abolished, keeping track themselves of make-believe lines of succession that, absent the decisive force of state power, inevitably end up splitting off into disputes that will never be resolved.
Yeah, then you'll likely know what he did, then. A very ugly period of history built on needless cruelty and fear. He straight up killed most of the Irish people for having the "wrong" religion.
Itâ€™s proven that a Monarchy (primarily constitutional) helps bring Stability, Political Normalcy, a more satisfied population and a much more stable and much more democratic system. I am not even pulling this out of my arse this are all general facts that Monarchies are, on average, more democratic, happier, stable etc. Who cares if they get to be born rich, by the logic of getting rid of the, because such why not also abolish inheritance in general.
