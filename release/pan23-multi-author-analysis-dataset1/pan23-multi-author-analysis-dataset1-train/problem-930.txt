Shoigu: "Mr. Putin, it appears Greece is going to send Ukraine S-300 air defense systems.... what do we do?".
Russia's invasion of Ukraine was supposed to be quick and clean, catapulting Russia back to the top of global politics and reestablishing for Russia a sphere of influence in eastern Europe as it becomes clear that the US and NATO can't protect them from half way around the world. It'd be the starting gun for China and other authoritarians to pick fights with their hated rivals or to establish local hegemony that would break the post-world war Anglo-American world order and go back to a world where the US can't say shit about what happens in anyone else's back yard and military conquest is a valid angle of diplomacy once more.
Hey Greece! If you really want to piss Russia off, just start recommending that the EU send the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to Ukraine for rebuilding and re-armament. We'll try and get you a commission if it happens. .
Well Russia definitely loses. At this point with all of Europe on guard, as well as the general dysfunction we’ve seen with their equipment across the board, I’m sure a very high percent of any Russian nukes would either be destroyed during launch or simple not even take off due to equipment failure. NATO conventionally could obliterate Russia and likely has been making preparations to dispose putins government if he tries to or does successfully hit that big red button.
