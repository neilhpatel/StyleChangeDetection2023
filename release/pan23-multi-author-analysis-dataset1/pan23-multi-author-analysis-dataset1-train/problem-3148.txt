why is there something wrong with people applying for asylum at the border? that's what you have to do to be "let in." usually after that, you get "claimed" by a family member or friend, and move to that location, which can be anywhere in the country, not just border states. you then follow your court dates near that location and maintain your legal status as a refugee or asylum seeker in the country. what's wrong with following a set legal process? is it the people following it? help me understand.
I love how they claim their hands are tied by their holy book when it comes to issues like gay marriage or even just having the decency to treat the LGBTQ+ community with the same baseline level of respect they give to adulterers, divorcées, people having premarital sex, gamblers, dead beat dads, greedy people, gluttonous people, etc.
Exactly! How is this legal? Isn’t this human trafficking or misuse of government funds or something? The state is assuming responsibility for these humans and they’re dumping them off on the street and that’s not a crime?
