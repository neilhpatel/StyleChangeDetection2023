2. Eisenhower pushed for, and received, permission to communicate directly with Stalin about military matters. The prevailing command culture in the US Army at that time was that commanders should be given a wide latitude to perform their tasks, and if they did not produce results, they were replaced. This was a frustrating contrast with the British system, where higher level commanders routinely expected to be micro-managed by the civilian government on the smallest matters, including troop deployment. So Ike did communicate directly with Stalin, but was very careful to confine his messages to purely military matters, because every single message was carefully scrutinized by both sides and Eisenhower was always criticized every time he sent any message to Stalin, even though all of the messages were exchanges of tactical or strategic intelligence, or the setting up of recognition signals and boundary lines for the eventual east-west meetup of forces.
One more follow up if you donâ€™t mind. Beyond Eisenhower, did Marshall or Churchill ever show any regret about agreeing to post-war partition of Europe after the start of the Cold War?
