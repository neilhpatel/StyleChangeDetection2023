For a question to get answered requires a coming together of several factors, the most important of which I would say are a) that there is someone on the subreddit who can answer it, b) that that person has the time to answer it, and c) that they are interested in answering it. For instance, if a question came up today that hit both a and c for me, unfortunately I wouldn't have been able to manage b, as I had plans this afternoon (John Wick 3, pretty good. Would recommend if you want a solid action flick).
Are there any insights you can give us about the current answer rate, perhaps how many threads are being made versus number of answers, what kind of expertise is being requested most, maybe even areas where there are many questions for a smaller number of active commenters?
I echo him. It is great people are asking, and trying to understand, but that doesn't make the questions interesting. I see plenty of questions which I know the answer to, and I even have time to respond to... which I just don't, because it is one which I just see nothing interesting in it, and would rather spend my time on something more rewarding to me. And it isn't infrequent that these questions, which to an expert is nothing more than uninteresting and tedious, strikes a chord with the users and gets upvoted to the 'the question' of the day, and that certainly correlates with the ones least likely to be answered, the bulk of the remainder from that 'over 90 percent' I mentioned at the beginning.
