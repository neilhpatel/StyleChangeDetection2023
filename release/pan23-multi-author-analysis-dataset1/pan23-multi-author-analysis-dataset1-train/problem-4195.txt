I’ll give you a clue. Donald Trump’s last two annual budget deficits together totaled 6 TRILLION DOLLARS. Granted, that included the PPP giveaway to his cronies bEcAuSe cOvId, and the tax refunds to racehorse and casino owners. But even without those, it’s a huge amount of debt he packed on. Biden’s first budget was still high, but at under 1.5 the biggest spending decrease in history from Trump’s blowout.
Republican economics is basically an experiment in governing via capitalism. Give everything away to corporations, make people work for money, and then they’ll use that money to buy things they need. Shared resources of the government won’t go to any necessities. If they did, they think that’s bad, because people work harder if they’re near starving.
