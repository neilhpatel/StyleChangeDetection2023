The already-linked answer by /u/keyilan offers one approach to this, which is to say that Qing China was in fact colonised. I think this is a valid approach, but I'd add a major caveat, that being that this was a form of colonisation that was distinctly early-Early Modern, a la the Portuguese and Dutch in the 16th and 17th centuries, rather than the more 'Modern' colonialism practiced in India and Africa in the 18th and 19th centuries. That is, these colonies were (with exceptions) small urban centres with primarily mercantile and military functions, intended to provide access to resources that remained within the territory of local people and states; rather than large stretches of conquered and directly-controlled territory.
Thanks for the brilliant answer! But using that logic, why would the British want to colonise the Mughals? Since they had access to plenty of coastal cities, wouldn't that have sufficed as it did in China? Maybe they were worried that the French would do it first?
Going into some more detail, Hong Kong (British) and Macau (Portuguese) stand out as clearly commercial enterprises, along with the Treaty Port concessions, while Qingdao (German) and Guangzhouwan (French) had some commercial function but were largely bases for naval power projection, and Port Arthur (Russian) and Weihaiwei (British) were explicitly naval bases. The two major losses of land, those being Taiwan (to Japan in 1895) and outer Manchuria (to Russia in 1860) were of regions that could be potentially construed as relatively peripheral â€“ but even so, such large land losses were hardly ideal for the Qing.
