This is not true for at least Chase Bank. Someone charged 250 to chipotle on my sapphire reserve card and within the hour, they started the process to dispute it and closed the card and issued me a new one, all while it was pending.
Yep. Banker here, NAL. Call your bank and dispute this charge, since it's a debit card you may have to wait up to 10 business days for them to give you provisional credit pending their investigation. Consider looking at getting a credit card in the future, if this happens again, Visa's money will be tied up instead of your own personal funds. At that point there's no real harm done aside from cancelling your card and getting a new one! Good luck OP.
you should also contact the employer/company that person works at, provide them with copies of what was ordered and where it was sent if it was sent to employees address, and date/time that person copied/photographed your card, make sure of your facts before doing this.
4. It may take a few days to get your money back (it shouldn’t, but it might). If so, talk to your landlord. Explain the situation, give him a copy of the police report. You’re not going to be evicted for being a few days late on rent after being the victim of a crime.
