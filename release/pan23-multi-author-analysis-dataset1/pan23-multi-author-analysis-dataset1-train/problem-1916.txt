The previous tenant (whom I replaced) has a similar situation to me and was not charged this fee at all. The tenant that took my place is paying $100 more per month that I did.
He also increased the rent by over $100 for the following tenant, so he is not losing any amount of money. If he rented it for cheaper, my lease states I would need to compensate through the end of June 2021.
How is a fee allowed if no fee is permitted through our lease agreement? I guess I just really don't follow.
You could try to go to small claims court and present the details about harassment, which may be construed as a constructive eviction, and that might be taken into consideration by a judge, but more than likely it will come down to the lease, the term and the breach, and the remedy in the lease. The judge may ask to see receipts, or simply may determine that $250 is a reasonable amount. That all depends on the judge that looks at the case. (Double check the lease for an arbitration/mediation clause which may require those steps before a lawsuit can be filed).
