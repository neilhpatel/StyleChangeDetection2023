Iirc nitrites from cured meat were associated mostly with liver cancer. The colorectal cancer isn’t surprising, but I don’t remember hearing it before. Like a diet heavy with meat (low fiber) or obesity in general were known risk factors for colon cancer. And fwiw when the article says “most bacon contains nitrites” it’s more like “all bacon contains nitrites” because even the “uncured” varieties are treated with celery extract which is high in nitrates and nitrites to cure the bacon.
Can you though? Every single hot dog brand I have ever seen labeled 'uncured' has celery powder or cultured celery juice as an ingredient... Which are both loaded with nitrates, they are just naturally occurring so the FDA lets companies label the product as 'uncured' with 'no nitrates added' even though those hot dogs are just as loaded with nitrates as hot dogs with synthetic nitrates (like sodium nitrate) are.
Fuck these warnings, I love ham. Good ham though. From a giant leg that has been glazed with whatever my drunk mil pulls out of the fridge mid-morning. None of this candy pink floppy business that comes from a packet and smells like cured garbage.
