Ogginsâ€™s book, one of few standard in this topic (medieval falconry), seems to interpret these two words as two distinct group of people, distinguished by the type of the bird of prey they took care of, as following: '......This show that Alfred was interested in and skilled a distinction was made between the men in charge of king's falcons (falconarii) and those who took care of his hawks (accipitrarii)' (Oggins 2004: 40).
As for the distinction between a hawk and a falcon, he also cites the following letters from the correspondences between Boniface and Anglo-Saxon rulers in the middle of the 8th century, discussed earlier in his book (Oggins 2004: 38):
It is true that a word hawk is said to Germanic origin, but AFAIK falcons (valcones) had been known in England for long, as mentioned in the 8th century correspondences cited above.
In my understanding, falcons, not hawks, were especially suitable for medieval falconry, though goshawks were regarding as OK (they were often mentioned in Anglo-Norman as well as Scandinavian sources).
These two letters suggests that falcons were regarded as more special sort of bird of prey among other (more general) hawks, much more skilled in hunting, at least in pre-conquest England (To tell the truth, I had initially assumed that these two words, falconarii and accipitrarii are employed almost just as synonyms, as they were in some sources in the 12th and 13th centuries and the former was much more common).
This is all so intriguing - thank you. No doubt I was reading too much into the difference between Hawking and Falconry. The difference between noble and ignoble falcons and the rationale behind it sounds very interesting. I really appreciate your answers, and I hope to be able to track down your references to do some additional digging.
