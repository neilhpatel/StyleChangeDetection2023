A first point: stories were not likely that widespread; those expressed in cultures speaking Indo-European languages likely came from a single common ancestor rather than from unique, diverse and widespread traditions. Non-Indo-European-speaking cultures occasionally have stories about giants, but they are not necessarily as widespread as is occasionally asserted.
I mean motifs in general. And not so much geographically widespread... more present in different unrelated cultures ( so independently showing up in many bodies of folktales, at a rate greater than expected by chance. ).
Because of that I'm skeptical of some of the claims about the importance of fossils behind people's various beliefs, I'd especially have to ask about the Mesoamerican interpretation of fossils because I've heard something similar in the past (particularly that Mammoth and Giant Ground Sloth bones were interpreted as Quinametzan giants destroyed by the gods) and since then I've never really been able to find particularly good sources that this really was a thing.
Thanks for your kinds words. There have been some great answers on floor stories - if you search the library of answers in this sub, you should be able to find them.
