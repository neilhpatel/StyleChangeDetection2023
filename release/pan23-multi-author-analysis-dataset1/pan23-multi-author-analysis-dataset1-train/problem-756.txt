tl:dr --- The US is noticing that some countries are beginning to falter in support for the Ukrainian war, with the majority of the rhetoric behind this decline being that Ukraine is not trying to do peace talks.
1. What exactly is the fake news? Are you not quoting the very same article that you are suggesting is fake? Maybe "headline" needs more context, but that's literally what headlines are for. You read the article to find out why.
Absolutely insane. Can they not imagine what it'd feel like for them if their people were being killed, raped, and tortured? How difficult it would be to try and find peace with someone who is the cause for having tens of thousands of people die for nothing?
Absolutely fair. I'm Canadian, so maybe it's partially an outsiders perspective on this topic, but on my end the same is definitely true for my people - very gullible (I'm sometimes guilty of this too.).
Also Russia raped and tortured hundreds of Ukrainians in Bucha and since then Zelenski refuses to negotiate with Russia since he sees Russia as more than willing to ignore international law, so what good will negotiating do with Putin, who has shown he could care less about deals.
2. A better conversation would stem from asking whether this is a good decision or not. Do you think it's a good idea that Ukraine have no interest in peace talks, and fights indefinitely? How effective is the PR going to be if kids on Reddit are reading that the are just doing it for show?
