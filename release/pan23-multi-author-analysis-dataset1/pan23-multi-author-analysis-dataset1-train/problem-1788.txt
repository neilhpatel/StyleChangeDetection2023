Everything she owned is now the property of something called Estate of Mom’s Name. Someone has to be appointed to be in charge of the estate. This is done by petitioning the probate court in the county where she lived. A simplified version of that person’s duties is to inventory assets and debts; pay debts using estate assets; and distribute what’s left to the heirs. That’s “probate.” Until that appointment is made, no one really has the right to take, use, give away, or throw away any estate property, scepter perhaps for funeral expenses. (As noted, joint bank accounts, some joint property, and accounts with named beneficiaries usually are not part of the estate.).
To access accounts, someone needs to go to court in their county and be named "administrator" of the estate, they receive letters of administration, and they take that and the death certificate to the bank to gain access, but the administrator cannot just do whatever they think is right, they have to follow Florida law. If the stepdad's name wasn't on the account, he had no right to access it.
