My own readings in Marxist theory and interpretation of British rule are rather limited, however, Irfan Habib has been a consistent contributor to this field of research and his works, albeit subject to similar critiques as other works of Marxist interpretation, cannot be dismissed and therefore I recommend it here now. His Indian Economy under British Rule, 1757–1857, A People’s History of India, Vol. 25 is a good read.
I think where Duncan gets the most pushback from I guess the "trained historian" community vs the "history enthusiast" community is the allowance he gives his political views to encroach on his historical views. I absolutely still stand behind his French Revolution series as deftly avoiding many of the pitfalls, especially around the Terror, that nearly every 'popular' history crashes into; however, I know his 'comparisons' of the Roman Republic to the United States drew some (understandable) eyebrow raising from many. It is also valid to call out that his books are being reviewed by other podcasters, and not the academic community. That's not inherently problematic, of course, however podcasters in general have far more incentive to praise one another's works for mutual promotion and sales, vs. an academic book review that follows a certain formula, is going to analyze and critique, and usually has no "incentive" to provide praise.
