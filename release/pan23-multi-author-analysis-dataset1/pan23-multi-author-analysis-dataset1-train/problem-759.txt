Is your work displayed on their website? In that case you can use the DMCA process to get it taken down. In the DMCA process, you first send a takedown notice to the website owner (the shop), but if they don't react or don't comply, you then take it to their webhost. The webhost will then contact them and will take the content down if they don't react with a defense (many webhosts have terms-of-service that allow them to take the content down immediately on receipt of a DMCA notice).
Yeah, I do know that. The person you "corrected" knew this as well. You are not "informing" anyone here.
Correct, however enforcing the copyright on a work that is not registered can be a very long and expensive proposition and without registration you are limited to collecting actual damages; With registration you are allowed to collect statutory damages and lawyer fees.
I agree with this. NAL, but I often make custom items for sale and personal use. My research tells me that I can use most IP for my own purposes, but I cannot sell it. If I want to use Disney font or a logo to make my own item, no big deal. But I can't sell items with copyrighted material.
