In hindsight, it is absolutely ridiculous how Putin got away with using the military-grade nerve agent Novichok in the UK, invading Ukraine's Crimea and Donbas, bombing a munition depot in the Czech Republic, shooting down the MH17 airliner, poisoning and murdering political opponents and dissidents in Russia, etc.
Wait a second. The still official narrative is that Mariupol was destroyed by ZSU trying to put a blame on RU armed forces. They are slipping in their propaganda...

Yep. Even IF somehow the US cuts all support, Europe cuts all support, and Russia somehow manages to capture all of Ukraine... that's when the hard part starts for Russia. They haven't even gotten to the hard part of occupation yet.
Intentional—means [to Russian audience] that (1) military failed to achieve or execution problem, ie, failure not due to Putin or his goals, (2) that world is so Russophobic and would rather arm ‘nazis’ than destroy them or help russia, (3) need for another mobilization is justified, (4) that the fear of NATO expansionism was justified bc look even Scandinavian countries on our border are joining.
Not in this case. The missile was homing on that building and the final approach was executed by the textbook with 65 degrees or more dive, hitting in the middle of a target. You can say a lot about the Russian missiles issues, but this one worked exactly as intended.
