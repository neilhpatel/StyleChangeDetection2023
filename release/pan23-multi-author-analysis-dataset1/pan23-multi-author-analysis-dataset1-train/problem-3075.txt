My librarian friend loves to point out that it is in fact one of the only spaces you are allowed to exist without spending money. Also, because it is a public space, any meetings held there are open to the public. So if any have some good snacks, you, as a member of the public, are legally allowed to partake. They can’t turn you away. They’ll try, but they legally can’t.
Here’s the code: It is unlawful for any person to loiter, stand or sit in or upon any public highway, alley, sidewalk or crosswalk so as to in any manner hinder or obstruct the free passage therein or thereon of persons or vehicles passing or attempting to pass along the highway, alley, sidewalk or crosswalk, or so as to in any manner annoy or molest persons passing along the highway, alley, sidewalk or crosswalk.
Ok, as you point out that's a 9th circuit case not a Supreme Court case. That matters a bit - the 9th circuit is only binding on the states within that circuit, not nationwide. However, that does include California.
