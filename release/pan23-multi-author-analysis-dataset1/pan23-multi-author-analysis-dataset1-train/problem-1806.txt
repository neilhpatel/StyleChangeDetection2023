Slavery, as anyone who knows anything about the Civil War can say, was at the core of the conflict. But the extent to which it was so central is often underestimated. The South was not merely a society with slavery, it was a slave society. Slavery was central to the Southern society, economy, identity and power, and as a result the South did everything it could to perpetuate their peculiar institution and extend it. Southerners were convinced that slavery needed expansion to survive, and agreed with anti-slavery northerners who thought that, once contained, slavery would slowly perish. The South simply could not allow this, and for this they changed from thinking of slavery as a peculiar institution to a political blessing.
The only way to prevent these differing visions from colliding was ignoring the Slavery Question, as the Union did for most of its history. Whigs and Democrats, by mutual agreement, had decided to keep slavery out of national politics. But greater consciousness due in part to the religious Second Great Awakening led to the rise of moral anti-slavery, which opposed slavery as not only something bad economically, but a sin. The North, for its part, industrialized and grew, and started to see Slave Society as something wrong. Political anti-slavery, based on the argument that the Founders intended for slavery to eventually end, rose in prominence. And finally, slavery could not be ignored, with event after event raising the point and ultimately leading to the destruction of the Two Party system and the rise of the Republicans as an anti-slavery coalition.
Great answer. I always like to think about what would have happened had Andrew Jackson been president instead of Buchanan. Would he have lived up to his Nullification threats to hang the first man he could get his hands on? Would the South have waited until the inauguration to officially leave the union? Itâ€™s hard to imagine him letting talk of seccession go on unchallenged.
