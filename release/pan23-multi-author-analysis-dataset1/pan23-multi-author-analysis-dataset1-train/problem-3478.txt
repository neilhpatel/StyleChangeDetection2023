It is legal to record someone in public, as long as they don't have a “reasonable expectation of privacy”. Otherwise, both individuals must consent to the recording otherwise it is illegal to record. .For example : When you record public officials or police, it is legal to record them if the recording is made within a public place BUT if the person captures you in your home or private setting with or without consent and then uses it on social media without your consent, you have legal recourse. This is defamation. The OP said the videographer was sharing with friends and has been known to do this before. If the OP feels it’s lewd and is not giving consent, there are grounds for violation of privacy as well as other implications when sharing videos of a minor. Showering, getting dressing, other intimate moments that are not necessarily sexual when objectified by taking and sharing non consensual videos become lewd acts simply because permission was not granted and the intent was not one caught accidentally say for a public filming event.
I doubt that would do much. An anonymous report saying “Joe has child porn I saw it” is unlikely enough to get a warrant. Without a warrant they can’t get evidence, and there’s no evidence.
