This is somewhat common with temp/placement/service provider agencies -- the contracts they have with their client companies to provide manpower/personnel frequently prohibit those clients from directly hiring those placed through the temp/placement/service provider agency for some period of time.
Sadly that did not work. I do not really understand how this type of contract is legal, let alone common. People should be allowed to move freely between companies, not forced to stay at one. Thank you for all of your help.
If they didn't have these clauses, the clients would simply use the MSP to find them qualified personnel, then cut out the MSP entirely and hire the personnel directly for much cheaper than they're paying the MSP, effectively exploiting the MSP as an employee screening service, and making it difficult for the MSP to make any kind of profit and stay in business.
This doesn't have anything to do with you, directly, though -- those clients are free to directly hire you, it's just that they may have to shell out a bunch of money to your employer for doing so, as per their contract with the MSP.
The places you apply to might be under contract with your former employer saying that if they directly hire you, they owe the MSP some sum of money. But you're not a part of that agreement -- that's something between the company you're applying to and the MSP.
