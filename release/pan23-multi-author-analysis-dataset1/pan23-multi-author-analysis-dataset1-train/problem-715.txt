Hunh, that's an interesting point. From the Western perspective it's easy to forget that the Bible isn't secretly motivating every political discussion lmao.
Yep. Maybe that's different. In India, there are certain things you can only do with a spouse or a relative. The assumption is that otherwise you'd just be able to scam people. We've always thought of it as normal. Good to learn.
It's fascinating how many poor nations have the resources to dedicate towards prosecuting homosexuals.
So yeah. Any recognition of Gay Marriage will require heavy legislation - what the rights of spouses are, who gets the peoperty, who gets the baby etc? Which is not the domain of the courts.
I rarely see commentary on reddit regarding Indian politics that doesn't immediately strike me as wildly partisan or very uncritical and I just wanted to applaud this comment for being neither.
Which is pretty fucking bad. So more power to these guys. We have a liberal Supreme Court. But I don't think it'll happen. Or if it does, it'll be a case of gross overreach by the Supreme Court.
