The Fourteen Part Message is one of many myths that have taken root on the Pearl Harbor attack. It fits into many of the narratives of the engagement, with Yamamoto--the noble enemy commander--determined that the attack should not be a surprise, and that the delay in receipt of the message was a critical failure on the Japanese part that made the attack an illegal sneak attack prior to the start of the war.
Of course, we may never know if that is true or not. Yamamoto was killed in 1943 and thus was not alive to be interviewed after the war or potentially tried for war crimes as the architect of the Pearl Harbor attack. I'm not an expert on Yamamoto, but I don't believe any diary entries or writings from Yamamoto definitively state whether it was his intention to have the message delivered before the attack. Yamamoto has taken almost mythological status over the last 80 years, and some historians who have sought to write biographies on him have reported that his family continues to closely guard his legacy and public image. I'm not sure we'll ever get a critical biography on Yamamoto like you might see with an American figure like Douglas MacArthur, whose public perception has changed significantly thanks to the study of historians. Regardless, the plan was predicated on surprise and would not have been nearly as effective if the US military on Oahu had even 10-15 minutes of advanced warning. Pearl Harbor was always intended to be a surprise attack and the 14-part message would not have changed that.
