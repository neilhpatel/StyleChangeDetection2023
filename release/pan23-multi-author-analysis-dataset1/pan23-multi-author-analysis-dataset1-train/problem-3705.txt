Your basic assumption is unfortunately incorrect. Schleswig is on the other side of Dannevirke, a fortification near the root of the Jutland Peninsula, and while we don't know exactly when it's from (400 AD-800 AD probably), it traditionally marks the border of what would be considered the realm of the Danes. Danes are mentioned in sources already around 500 AD, and around 800 AD it was probably the most consolidated realm north of the Frankish Kingdom. Those facts should probably indicate that Christianizing the Schleswig area wasn't a simple task at the time, although we have very few Danish sources about those times, what with proper writing and record-keeping being introduced to the Danes with Christianity (Yes runes were a thing, but record-keeping, messages, letters etc mostly came with Christianity).
Thank you very much. The border between Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire were also definitely not very clear - bordering on nonexistent during medieval times. Some of the Dukes of Schleswig (the duchy, not the city) were vassals to the Danish king and the Holy Roman Emperor at the same time. How did such a relationship work? We don’t really know all to well, but it shows borders weren’t fixed or close to being stable at many points during the medieval age.
