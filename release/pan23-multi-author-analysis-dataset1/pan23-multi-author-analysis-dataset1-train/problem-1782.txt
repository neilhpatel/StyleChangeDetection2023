Additionally, whatever rights he thinks he has end where stalking and abuse start. Document those as best you can. Note when and what occured and record it if you can. Go to ex parte court and get a TRO. Today, if you can. Those don't usually require direct evidence be presented until the subsequent hearing. Don't be afraid to pursue the extension even if he quits his bullshit and/or you don't have his tantrums recorded. Testimony is evidence.

Napalmenator is correct. Contempt is the way. Your ex is refusing to comply with a court order. Some states give courts the ability to put them in jail until they sign over whatever property they were ordered to sign over. It would be worth your time to consult with an attorney about this. Initial consultations are usually free or at least reduced rate.
