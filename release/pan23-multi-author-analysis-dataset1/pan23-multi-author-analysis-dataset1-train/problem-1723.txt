My first instinct wasn't to think about rear-echelon operations but about propaganda motives, i.e. the Wehrmacht wanting to present a picture of itself as a modern and mechanized army. You touched on this but maybe you can provide some more information? I'd still assume propaganda value plays into it, but do we know how much of this is a part of it? Considering the state of photography in the 1940s I'd assume that front-line photography was feasible and practiced on both sides of the war, and I'd assume those pictures were more likely to be published than pictures of rear-echelon operations due to their propaganda value but do we know if pictures with horses in them were intentionally not published or censored in any way (for example were horses or animals cropped out or do we know if Feldpost from soldiers at the front was censored in regards to pictures of animals)?
It certainly did. In the West, rail networks were dense, and fodder was often available locally, so it wasn't a big problem there. On the Eastern Front, the German army had expected to be able to get (i.e., steal) oats and green fodder locally. However, Russian horses were not usually fed grain, so oats were not available in enough quantity for the Germans. Green fodder was also insufficient in many areas. Result: many, many German horses died in the first winter on the Eastern Front. After that, more fodder was shipped by rail to the front.
