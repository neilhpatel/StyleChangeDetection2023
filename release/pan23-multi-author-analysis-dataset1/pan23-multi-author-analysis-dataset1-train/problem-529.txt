I see what you mean, but I think the OP meant e.g. paintings from the Dutch Renaissance (when he meant hyper realistic he wasn’t using that as a style but solely as an adjective). And it’s actually a very good question Dutch Renaissance paintings (I.e. Dutch realism) are insane and borderline hyper realistic - the same stands for Spanish paintings from the same era (thinking of Las Meninas here, for instance), and they’re well from centuries before cameras were invented. So let me rephrase the question in another way - before the advent of photography, what led Dutch Renaissance realist (and not hyperrealist) paintings to pop up at the time they did, and why weren’t medieval/classic artists capable of producing art as realistic as that? Roman sculpture, after all, was known for its realism. What stopped Roman artists from producing paintings such as those of great Dutch masters? Technology? Dyes? Formal education?
Look at some of hyper realistic work in contrast to . Both are realistic but Close’s source imagery comes from a photograph. You can see it clearly if you know where to look: individual hairs have been captured, the smoke in motion, a shallow depth of field at play, whereas Courbet’s is much more like what you would see in a mirror. You can see wisps of hair, the outline of tendons in his arm but not the hairs or veins, etc. I think it’s worth pointing out that Courbet was a 19th century Realist and a predecessor to the photorealistic/hyperrealistic movement.
When you say hyperrealism I’m going to assume you mean little h, aka paintings that are extremely realistic and not the movement itself which combines photorealistic elements with narrative. I’m also going to speak purely in terms of paintings and drawings as the raw materials and methods used in hyperrealistic sculptures today (think Evan Penny) would not be available to artists in the past.
