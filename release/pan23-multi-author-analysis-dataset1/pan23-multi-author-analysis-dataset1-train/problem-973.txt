Reporting the crime will not cost you anything. Make a police report, the prosecutor will decide to press charges. You arenâ€™t suing him just filing criminal charges against him. Reach out to a victim advocacy in your area. They will help.
Just think about it this way if you don't say anything else to him about it at all if you keep your boyfriend in him from getting into it the police will just make all of the school away and there's a decent chance that outside of the courtroom you won't even have to deal with this guy much longer.
NAL. He has committed sexual assault if not worse and even documented it himself on his phone. Police should be called, potentially a restraining order pursued (if you want to) as well as a lawyer retained (if you want to pursue civil litigation). He needs to be caught unawares so he doesn't have a chance to delete the evidence. That being said, "I saw it on his phone once" isn't going to be strong evidence in criminal or civil court. His existing legal history will hopefully help your case though.
