In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yep. There are a lot of things to worry about if Republicans take the House. Criminal investigations aren't really one of them.
I know. It is depressing that my low expectations for moral behavior are baked in at this point. I have no expectations that they will 'come to jesus' and see the error of their ways - most people capable of that level of honest introspection have left or been pushed out. I do hope that their numbers will shrink, and their power will shrink, and they won't be able to fuck the world over as much in the future as they have in the past. The advantages they have gained by cheating, gerrymandering, stealing SC seats, structural advantages in how we elect our representatives, etc. have hopefully been maxed out at this point and will diminish as older folks die off.
