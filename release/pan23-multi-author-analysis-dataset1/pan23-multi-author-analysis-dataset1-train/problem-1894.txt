They've never, not once voted in favor of expanding civil rights for their fellow citizens. They've always been shitty people voting for shitty politicians to use the government as a tool to hurt the people they hate since the beginning. I was watching old news footage of southern conservative politicians from the 50s arguing for their hateful policies of the times, and it's the exact same language, just trade out what group is being hated on that given decade, and it's all practically word for word. I mean, they will take this country back as far as they can if we let them. They resent that we've been trying to force them to become decent people and they want their revenge.

You're literally comic book villains, Republicans. Seriously go read an x-men comic that was written 50 years ago. You're literally. Comic book villains.
Southern Conservatives (i.e. the GOP base) voted in nearly 100 years of Jim Crow before the left forced them to stop. The same way they were forced to stop discriminating against gay people and forced to follow all the other civil rights that have happened. If they ever had a fig leaf at all, it's the one we gave them when they started calling themselves Republicans. It's like we practically gave them a 'do-over' for rebranding themselves and we had to relearn all over again that "Wow, these really are some racist treasonous assholes." Well, like, yeah. They don't keep their Confederate flags around for nothing.
