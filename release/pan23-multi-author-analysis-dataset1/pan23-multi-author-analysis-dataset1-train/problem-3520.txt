I think we're inching to that point where the Chinese take a shot at a US drone flying around the South China Sea and being like ... what? It was flying over our territory...
The RIM-7 Sea Sparrow is a lightweight, relatively low-cost, mobile, short-range anti-aircraft missile system mostly intended for point defense batteries on warships, primarily to intercept incoming sea-skimming anti-ship missiles. They've been around since the 1970s, the US has manufactured an absolute shitload of them, about a dozen countries use them, and their age combined with economies of scale mean they're cheap (for a guided missile) and reliable.
But, to what end? Its just not hard to get into the US, not hard to pay some jerk off with a drone to do the same thing without it coming back to you. Do you really mean to tell me you actually think China couldn't have easily found a less conspicuous and more reliable method to get photos of anything they would want to get photos of?
I'll eat crow on that one. I wanted it shot down over rural Montana, but I wasn't aware just how large it was at the time. If it had been carrying a bioweapon or something equally dangerous, the results could have been catastrophic. Thankfully that doesn't appear to be the case. I think old Joe made the right call on this one.
More relevant to Taiwan, it would also work really well if you were to, say, set up a bunch of them to mount to relatively cheap civilian truck chassis and keep them moving around your coastline to intercept large quantities of incoming cruise missiles trying to make gaps in your coastal defenses for a landing force. Taiwan already has some of them mixed in with their shore defenses, but the way they're deployed isn't very mobile and they're going to need a lot more.
