Pshhh! You can't have people deciding religion on their own. That'd be preposterous. I mean think about it. What would happen if you didn't raise anyone religious from birth and then had them research and make a conscious choice about faith when they were of mature, rational age. I mean, come on, how could religion even survive. Don't you care about god? Don't you want your soul saved?
Similarly, another common tactic like this in red states (like here in FL) is to use terminology in the wording of laws to make things fairly non-specific and then rely on selective enforcement to cudgel those politically opposed to them. As an added benefit for them, they don’t always even need to abuse the flexibility in the laws but instead can rely on a chilling effect causing those who don’t want to be targeted to self-censor.
Yup. These same groups coming up with these bills (Alliance Defending Freedom) seem to think that they can stem the tide of America becoming less religious by forcing and compelling people to do things. It's backfired once before, and it will backfire again. They always claim "Jesus is a gentleman", but they want to force you against your will to pray?
