the above is bullshit, but if you so wish, it can be imbued with meaning. however, I would say that Russia is at a crossroads, they are fighting uphill with the sun in their face. no good long term. silly that fool is. of the old ways he tries to be. death will be the end most certainly.
If it’s not enough they’re going to be hit by airstrikes, these soldiers are also going on a mass frontline during winter in 2022, something which has never been on this large of a scale since the Second World War, I really hope they can get enough winter clothing for the coming months, Frostbite was a colossal issue in WWII and a lot of soldiers died due to lack of gear to withstand the cold.
HIMARS is a kind of artillery. The drones, yeah, technically those are air assets. Only the tiny ones can operate on the front though. Bigger assets like the Bayraktars are still suppressed by the Russian SAM umbrella and have to stick to the Ukrainian interior unless an opportunity can be opened for them with SEAD assets.
