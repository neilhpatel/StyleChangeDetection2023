The email is my personal one not affiliated with the school. The information includes my previous correspondence with the clinic, a pdf document with all my medical information (I already sent them the screenshot of the negative portion of the test) I just don’t feel comfortable sharing anything that isn’t affiliated to the school.
Ok. None of that changes your answer. You submitted a test with incorrect date information. They want to see evidence that the error came from the test site and that you didn't forge a document. This is not unreasonable.
The admin told me that he was okay with me just forwarding him the email that I sent to their covid clearance department (with my school email) where I provided the screenshots and that he’d take that into consideration before deciding whether he and he alone thinks it responsible for purposefully submitting a falsified test. I had tested positive with covid during the next round of test submissions and had no problem immediately alerting the school so why would I falsify one right before? I’m just baffled.
