If someone is basing a play or video off you, they are not legally bound to credit you for inspiring the work. And you have no legal right to force them to credit you.
NAL but a professional theatre production manager and producer who secures and oversees entertainment contracts including royalties. In one of your comments you say they are asking you to sign a document that states "in perpetuity"; so are they offering to pay you indefinitely from residuals? With that, if the play or rather script is to be professionally produced and published the script will be managed by a publishing company such as Samuel French which is now Concord Theatricals and producers have to apply for the Rights to produce and must pay a Royalty to do so. It is common that any artistic rights for use of their protected material (i.e. listed songs with permission from artist) in the original script to be included in the rate to secure the Rights to produce royalty Agreement. Meaning, that any artist who gave permission to use their material, in this case you as the muse, will get a portion of the royalty each time it is produced. And my friend, if the script turns into a film, that could be even a larger amount of compensation.
