The earliest iron metalworking in ancient China were done using the technique known as kuan-lian (塊煉), where pulverized iron ore are heated in a charcoal clay bloomery and turned into highly impure chunks of spongy slag-iron lumps called kuaitie (塊鉄). These lumps must then be heated and hammered repeatedly to remove their impurities and turn into workable iron. The earliest examples of this type of iron smelting process are found in Moguo burial sites in modern day eastern Gansu province, from around 11th century BC. Until the end of the or 6th century BC, pretty much all irons in China were produced via this type of kuan-lian low temperature smelting process. (c. 470 – 391 BC), a famous Warring States era siege engineer and the founding of the Mohist school of philosophy, wrote the following on his Fortification of the City Gate,:
Very interesting! So if I understand correctly, the blast furnaces themselves (熔爐) were made of material that could withstand the temperatures of molten iron? You mentioned they were made with brick instead of clay, were these bricks made of any special material or just regular old clay that's been treated in a kiln? My understanding was that regular clay pottery wasn't refractory, i.e. the temperature required to melt iron would destroy the pottery.
