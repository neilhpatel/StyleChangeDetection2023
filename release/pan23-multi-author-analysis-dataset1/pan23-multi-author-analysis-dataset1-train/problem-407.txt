The amount of the inheritance can play a part here. I avoided probate (fixed by government for a standard fee $3300.00 here, unless clearly a very complex and convoluted situation ie: land and investments all over the place) when my wife died, even with a legal will, as the amounts were small enough that I could sign a waiver claiming Iâ€™ll be the one responsible if anything goes wrong (had to prove my ability financially - also credit check) Saved my son,the main beneficiary the 3300.
1. When someone dies, everything they owned automatically becomes part of their "estate." So this would be "The Estate of Dad.".
Either way unless everything has beneficiary designations or was jointly held you are likely to need to open a probate - the only way to avoid probate is with a trust or by making sure everything has a beneficiary or is jointly held (when you start thinking about your own planning).
4. They go to court to receive articles of administration, they open a bank account in the estate's name, they probate the estate.
