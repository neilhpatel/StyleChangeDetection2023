The key factor here is that for any expectation of life at birth, infant (or child, or early adult) mortality in average conditions varies within manageably close bounds: the greater uncertainty is at older ages (often overstated in 19th-century census returns, along with "heaping" at ages ending in -5 or above all -0) and in adjusting for epidemic deaths (which didn't necessarily fall evenly or even consistently on different age groups).
When we arrive at the vital events registration period, English infant mortality ranges from about 150 to 200 per thousand in the 17th-18th centuries when life expectancy averaged 35-40 years (Wrigley &c, English population history from family reconstitution, CUP 1997, p 295-6). Early 19th-century French infants fared rather worse, with a rate of 180-190 against life expectancy of 38-39 (Jean Bourgeois-Pichat, Note sur l'evolution general de la population francaise depuis le XVIII siecle, Population 7:2 ,1952): calculations for the mid-18th century indicate a rate of 280 with life expectancy at 28.
You're right to be suspicious. More can always be said, especially on your question re where we derive the data from; for the meantime, by u/alriclofgar addresses the matter of life expectancy.
