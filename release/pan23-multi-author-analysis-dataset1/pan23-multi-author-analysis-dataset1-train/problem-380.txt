College? That sounds like more of that liberal-commie-satan worshipping nonsense. You mean how will you be able to pay for Trump's latest round of NFT trading cards!
Liberals tend to see the world as a place where observable differences are superficial, rarely reflecting actual value (low Hierarchical world belief), cosmic purpose or intent (low Intentional world belief), deserved status (low Just world belief), or attention received (high Worth Exploring). Therefore, most hierarchies require reform (low Acceptable world belief). Fortunately, however, the world is getting better and change is taking us in the right direction (high Progressing world belief). Therefore, embracing change and rejecting inequality (the textbook definition of liberalism) is just common sense.‚Äù.
Thanks for the link. Maybe Senator Hawley should read the piece about that human stain. This is the Timothy McVeigh who didn't care about the families of the 19 children he killed - "I understand what they felt in Oklahoma City. I have no sympathy for them.".
