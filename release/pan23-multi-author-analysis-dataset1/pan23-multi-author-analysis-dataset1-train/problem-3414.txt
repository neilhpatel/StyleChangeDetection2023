No doubt. I remember in the opening days Russia dropped onto Ukraine a lot of bomblets from rocket artillery pods. They also used those plastic "butterfly mines" which are _far_ worse than unexploded bomblets. They are mines and and are designed to not explode until touched. Plastic means hard to detect. Also kids think it's and go to gram them.
Russians are already using cluster munitions, so the potential unexploded bomblet problem is already present without the Ukrainians benefitting from using them.
Oof. Cluster bombs are bad news. If your fuse factory has a 1 in 10,000 failure rate, and you drop a hundred, 100lb bombs, you'll probably never see one fail. And if you do, it's a big honkin' bomb that you can easily find and send EOD to take care of. But if you drop a hundred cluster bombs, each one of which contains a hundred 1lb submunitions, you're pretty much guaranteed to have at least one that doesn't go off. And it's small, so it just sits in a field somewhere for 20 years until a civilian kid long after the war blows themself up playing with it.
