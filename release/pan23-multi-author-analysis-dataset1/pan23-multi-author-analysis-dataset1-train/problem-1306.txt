In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yep. The amount of open antisemitism, homophobia and transphobia on social media is alarming. It's not being called out or banned much anymore either.
Exactly. They might not agree on everything, but they're still united as a group. Some factions might fight each other, but at the end of the say, they're all still fascists.
As a Christian myself… I don’t agree with the idea that Christians should be controlling anybody through the laws or positions of power… I am human, and I wish everyone could agree with me, but I know that can never happen, nor would it be a good thing… These “Christians“ Who want Christians to have all of the power in the world to make laws against those who don’t agree with them missed the point that Jesus made that our kingdom is not meant to be here on earth… Our job is to get you into the new kingdom, not one that we create physically on earth.
