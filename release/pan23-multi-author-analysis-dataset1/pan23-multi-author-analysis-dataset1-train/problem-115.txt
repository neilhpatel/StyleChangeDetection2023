A critical fault of the Republican Party is that they do not stand for anything. They are against immigrants, against taxation, and on and on and on. As a consequence they do have any positive positions in their plank to rally around. Iâ€™m not sure they even have a plank anymore. There are no positive ideas upon which they can anchor their party. They are left with personalities, name calling, lies and hate. That party was not always like that. It started changing with Ronald Reagan, got worse with the Tea Party and worse still with Trump. When they start looking at De Santis they remain on that same path that is farther right than conservatism. This country needs a true conservative voice in our national conversations. Crime is a problem; our country needs strong border protection, climate change has to effectively addressed. Our current political climate is one of our worse enemies.
