Exactly - if you were to remove the religious aspect (or maybe not) they/he meet most of the aspects or facets of a cult. The belief and faith part is strong, you really cannot debate them as there is no logic but belief. They easily and willingly are parted with their money - they follow pretty much anything said with or without logic or truth. While he does not have a set of by-laws it is a bit of a figure it out as we go but he has targets. And the targets while generally democratic or liberal he will also pick off or try to with anyone in the Republican Party if they get in his way or don’t believe in what he believes. That was obvious with the mid-terms so he has been a bit revealed as some flaws in his beliefs with the upper ranks - but his cult members for the most part just keep on keeping on. And the upper ranks while probably having no more use for him won’t fully admonish him in most cases as those cult members are still dangerous to them in a number of areas. Lastly as I could go on he has without a doubt changed the face of the Republican Party and it’s underlying philosophy- this is most apparent with the incoming House members agenda. They really don’t care about the people they care about themselves and what’s important to them.
