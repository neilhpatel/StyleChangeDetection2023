Yikes! Yeah to be clear I am definitely glad we're at home, it's just crazy how fast it all changed. My wife was in Chile for work a few years ago when there was widespread rioting. She got stuck for several days in a small town and couldn't get back to Santiago to fly home because of curfews and the timing of flights. She said she would be eating in her hotel restaurant where she was stuck and then a group of protestors would come by and the hotel staff would clear the dining room and send everyone back to their rooms and hope the armed guards would deter them from seeing the building on fire (because they had torched several buildings, mostly in Santiago though). She had no desire to have that experience again so she was more than happy for us to go home instead.
Obeying an undemocratically instituted constitution is undemocratic. Obeying the democratic 1933 or more relevant 1978 constitution would be.
Corruption isn't an inherently incomparable individual subjective experience like disease, discrimination, tragedy, etc. It can be measured in total amount of bribes, damage to economy, loss to gdp, etc.
