With routed troops, yes. They're at the point where panic has overtaken reason and their only thought is to run away and things like shields or spears will be discarded. Those soldiers who kept their head and retained their arms stood a better chance of getting off the field unmolested since the enemy preferred to strike down defenceless fleeing soldiers rather than try to take on men who still retained their arms and would still defend themselves.

Yep! Usually only kings could expect to have their remains carried home, preserved in wax or honey. For ordinary warriors at Athens, the ideal was for the bodies to be burned on-site and for the bones to be taken home for public burial - but recent scholarship has questioned whether even this was logistically feasible, given the sheer bulk and weight of the cremated remains of hundreds of men (and in some cases more).

Mounds scattered all over Greece would testify to Spartan commitment to its allies and foreign interests.
