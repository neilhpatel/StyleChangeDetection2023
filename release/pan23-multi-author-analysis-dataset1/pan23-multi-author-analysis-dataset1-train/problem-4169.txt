Yes, but this same supervisor was reported for timecard fraud in the past and HR did either little or nothing about it. We do, however, have a union and the rep was VERY alarmed about the timecard fraud but everyone was fearful of committing career suicide if they submitted an official statement. They likely would take this more seriously than HR would.
The big risk for the company is that a policy like this substantially discriminates against anyone with mobility, pulmonary, circulatory, or coordinative disabilities. Those people can and should request a reasonable accommodation, which would likely include not being asked to do physically demanding tasks not connected to their responsibilities. This risk may be a good reason for HR to shut this practice down - I would speak to them and ask, fairly neutrally, what the company's policies are on managers asking employees to run laps.
That’s interesting. I never would’ve thought that, say, a retail store manager could tell a sales associate to run laps around the store as a punishment and that would be perfectly fine.
