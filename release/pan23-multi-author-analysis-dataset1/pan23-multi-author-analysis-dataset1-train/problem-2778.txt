The problem here is that while we have definitive evidence that abortion was known and practiced among the Aztecs, the details are a bit hazy. Women's issue, in general, tend to get short shrift in historical works. Something like abortion, which was a crime among both the Aztecs and the Spanish, doubly so. That most of the early Spanish chroniclers were friars does not help either. So I could rattle off a dozens of different herbs that Sahagun's General History of the Things of New Spain says can help with everything from gout to fever to diarrhea to UTIs, but the primary sources are mum on the specifics of abortifacients.
Something occurs to me. It seems as though Bancroft is the modern originator of this idea, that is if Berdan and Avalos base their conclusions on his work. However, he wrote in 1883, well before modern translations of the Florentine Codex were available. Is it possible, in your opinion, that he may have been working from a bad translation? Or, did he used Sahagun's annotations of the text, which have been noted by scholars such as Ortiz de Montellano as not always being accurate to the corresponding Nahuatl descriptions? Assuming of course, that I haven't simply missed the relevant passage?
