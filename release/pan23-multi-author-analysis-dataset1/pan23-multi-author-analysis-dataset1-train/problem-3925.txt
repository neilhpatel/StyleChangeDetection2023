I'm not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean before or after your lease term would actually be up?
You are on the hook for the term outlined in your lease; no more, and no less unless the landlord either agrees to early termination, or re-rents the unit.
In PA, it's unclear whether or not landlords have a duty to mitigate, so if your lease does not allow you to move out two months early, then you are on the hook for those two months. Paying them should be satisfactory to rectify the situation.
No. Unfortunately, I sent the message in haste. I knew I had the option of finding a new tenant as a variable provided by him last year. I feel like asking the question opened a can of worms and now I'm getting vague terms that I will be responsible for turnover when replacing the tenant.
They (broker, landlord is copied on communication) have said that in finding a new tenant I will be responsible for turnover meaning cleaning, painting, etc. That etc. is what I mean by vague. If they re-rent the unit, I will not be responsible for rent, this is true.
