I also worked in South Sudan for a while back in 2012. To be honest, I’m surprised journalists are allowed to film anything. I’ve done a lot of traveling (think close to the Somalian border) to places where people don’t take kindly to cameras, whether because of folk Islamic beliefs or suspicion… but even the Somalian border didn’t quite compare to how anti-camera the folks in South Sudan were. I was present at the first SPLA Day observation post-independence and my colleague, who had been working in the region for a decade, was nearly arrested for simply having a camera on his person. The air that day was the thickest I’ve ever felt in a public place, like one little thing could cause a violent snap (unfortunately, some time later a poor Kenyan woman was shot and killed at a similar observation when she didn’t salute the South Sudanese flag as it was raised). I remember hearing about that and thinking how close we might have been to something similar that day. I have never minded myself as obsessively as I did that day, as if every breath or glance I took might start something that would spiral out of control… and I didn’t even have a camera.
It does! I had prostate issues a few years back and my doctor literally wrote “freq ejac” on a prescription card as part of a list of recommendations.
