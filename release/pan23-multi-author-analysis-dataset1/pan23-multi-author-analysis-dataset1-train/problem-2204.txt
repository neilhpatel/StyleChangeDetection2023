The reality is that the Russians know they have to make major gains before the Western tanks start arriving. Then they will attempt to solidify their positions by crying out for "peace" before they start getting their asses handed to them.
Exactly. Russia can outproduce Ukraine. Russia can't outproduce Ukraine's allies. The question is does the political will match the industrial capacity.
Seriously. Those guys who fought off the hordes for 10 hours, watching their ammunition running out, down to the last grenade, only to be saved by a retreat at the last minute... no words for that. The fact that they are still in the fight is incredible.
Exactly. The last paragraph of your comment couldn't have been said better. Acknowledging the difficulties and challenges faced by Ukraine does not mean a person is in favor of appeasing Russia or avoiding this conflict altogether.
lol bro. Just yesterday Trump, you know the guy the GOP won't quit sucking the dick of, said that he trusts Putin over US intelligence. Oh and then today he says that halting aid to Ukraine will stop the fighting... Yup man nothing to see here haha.
