I was hit by a kid (17) with too many passengers in NJ (a big no-no). The cop was lazy and sloppy in his work (didn't address my concern about the passengers and let him go with no tickets and fouled up the report that took 2 weeks to straighten out-got the body cam footage of the cop being lazy and ignoring my complaint so I had him disciplined and sent to remedial training through police IA -surprise mofo). He said that I could go to the court clerk and issue the tickets myself if I wanted to, so I did. If you live in/near the town that the accident happened or close by, you can use the police report as probable cause, fill out the tickets, the clerk will bring them before the judge and they determine if there is probable cause to sign the tickets and mail the summons (provisional license and I threw in a reckless driving for good measure (surprise mofo).
Maybe. Their job is to make you whole. Whether or not they subrogate is up to them. The only thing you might have to sue the other driver for busy or deductible, and you will not need a lawyer.
You'll need to either go through your own insurance or sue the driver. But you need to get your car out of the tow yard ASAP, you will NOT be reimbursed for these extra days, you'll have to pay that personally, get the car out today.
