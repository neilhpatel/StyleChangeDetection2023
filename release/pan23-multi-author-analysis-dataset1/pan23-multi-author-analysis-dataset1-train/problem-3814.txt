I don’t see China unless it’s completely in secret, China I think is friendly with Russia no doubt but as a necessity for certain things like energy. Whoever knowingly harbors a fleeing Putin is going to get backlash from the west, especially if he is able to do some crazy shit before he flees. Just an opinion.
Unlike Uae and Saudi, the world can actually bully Serbia and Hungary a lot more as Arab Courtny's supply the world with oil, have unlimited money and have huge arms contracts with American Arms firms, America/Europe would Economically destabilize Serbia or Hungry for hosting Putin.
Smart. So many of these people don't have a fucking exit plan for their stupid shit. I'd have a bug out locations all over the world and billions hidden. I'd have made myself a fake ID when I was still in the KGB, and kept that person current. Picked a country, gave myself a backup life or two. Some upper middle class person who pays taxes but doesn't really exist. Somewhere where people don't care that much.
Probably. Especially if it means making things less mess over the long run. No potential for a civil war or a Putin with nothing left to lose trying to lunch a nuke or something. He might have a few loyalist left that might pull the trigger.
