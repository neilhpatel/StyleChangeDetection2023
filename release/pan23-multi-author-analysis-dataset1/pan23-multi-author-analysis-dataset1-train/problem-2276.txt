When you essentially say "I'm not only going to ask you to remove them from the home on an emergency basis I'm going to make sure they don't have a toothbrush or a wallet unless I approve it", you are giving the judge an extremely strong impression that you are making the restraining order petition to gain advantage in a personal or family dispute, not to protect yourself.
The children have not been exposed to the police and their germs. Not worried about DHs germs. And I don't want to expose the kids any further to DHs abuse or manipulation. Because they've already been exposed to abuse in the past, they should continue to be today???? Wtf???
Your husband is principally to blame, and you're running a distant second for refusing an eminently reasonable condition to assure your safety without allowing the potential for you to abuse the emergency protective order system.
I deleted my post thinking it would shut this whole thread down. As I'm not interested in debating the merits of my position anymore. I got an answer. And I've lawyered up.
