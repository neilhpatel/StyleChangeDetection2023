A couple of your points raise more complex discussions. First, was the evidence against Báthory just gossip? No, there was a ton of believable evidence against her that weighed in favor of her guilt. There is also a lot of evidence that the proceedings against her mostly followed applicable Hungarian law.
There is a lot of evidence that the parties involved in arresting Elisabeth Báthory believed the traditional monetary penalty would apply. Nicholas Zrínyi (husband to Anna Nádasdy and Elisabeth Báthory’s son-in-law) wrote to the palatine after Báthory’s arrest that “I desire a peaceful conclusion to that affair... and that the property will remain intact – that even the Fiscus will not confiscate the estates… I am myself related to the family, therefore I want my portion, both on this side and on the far side of the Danube, too.” Countess Dracula, loc. 2966.
But, instead of having a conversation about why and how that happened, everybody just decided to go full HAM with the exaggerations, and that’s how we get “VAMPIRE WITCH BATHED IN THE BLOOD OF A MIlLION VIRGINS AND MADE CORSETS WITH THEIR ENTRAILS!”.
P.S. I would LOVE to read your sources. The strange mythologies that people have developed around Báthory are nearly as interesting as the history.
