The executor of her brother's estate can order a copy of her brother's personal federal tax returns for the past 2 years (from the IRS) and that might give clues to information about the trust tax return (which probably has its own separate EIN number).
Yeah, I think you're right. I looked it up, and apparently banks have to hold statements for five years for closed accounts. Idk where she got that idea from.... lol.
He probably also submitted federal tax returns for the trust but it might be harder to get that information, but maybe having the name of the trust (as it is shown on the dividend checks) might be enough for the IRS to do a search for the trust by the name of the trust.
If he was receiving trust dividend income from various sources, then he would have been issued dividend tax statements for the trust every year, and he should have been preparing an annual trust tax return, but maybe he was unaware of this fact and therefore did not prepare a trust tax return.
My mom is the executor. Unfortunately, she closed all of his bank accounts, and she said she's unable to get statements at this point. (I'm not sure if she's right about not being able to get statements anymore. Maybe she is, but I don't think she even tried to get statements.) Either way, it could be an issue if she closed all his accounts. Would there be a trust account as well? Don't you usually have to deposit checks made out to the trust in the trust's bank account? Maybe that account exists, and she isn't aware of it?
