Greetings! Whilst I cannot unfortunately comment on the second half of your title and the exact number of volunteers for the colonies of the British Empire, I can shine some light on the distinction between casualties for the British troops and those who were recruited from the Empire. All of which come from R.A.C Parker's excellent publication The Second World War: A Short History. Let's begin.
I know the large majority of the British troops in North Africa were British/Commonwealth, but I've been watching Mark Felton's videos on YouTube where he goes into the relatively unknown groups that fought for both sides, such as the Middle Eastern troops who joined Germany (I believe because they shared a common disdain for Israel and Jews, but I could be wrong), although if I remember correctly they were involved more in logistics and support than as combat troops. If you haven't watched him already, Dr. Felton is a phenomenal researcher and makes excellent videos on portions of the war I otherwise would have probably never heard about. Because of the stories he covers, the question I posted popped into my head.
