Late Ancient western cavalry was essentially coming from Late Roman cavalry : Frankish mounted units were already mentioned in the Noticia, but Frankish conquests in Gaul allowed Franks to takeover most of the laetic units stationed there, especially Alans and Taifales. In addition, other Roman cavalry units stationed in Gaul (probably under the rule of hospitalitas, being supported trough land allocation which meant they were tied up to Roman landowners in Gaul, probably as bucellari, a private army) which Procopius mentions one century later.
Agreed. And I've long suspected this happens in the 7th century when the Romans pull back into Anatolia, establishing the so-called "theme system." The evidence for this, however, is very difficult to find.
What I meant is allocation of revenues of these lands (although not necessarily fiscal), still worked by the possessor (or, rather, the possessor's community) in a context of collapse of state authority in the 430's to 450's in Northern Gaul, leaving it a bit murky when it come to the differentiation between landed allocation and fiscal allocation; as well in the context of a growing Frankish state remarkable for its light-weighted militia in the late Vth to early VIth.
Agreed, Halsall makes this point as well. There were different types of "settlement" but the foederati proper seem to have gone through hospitalitas.
