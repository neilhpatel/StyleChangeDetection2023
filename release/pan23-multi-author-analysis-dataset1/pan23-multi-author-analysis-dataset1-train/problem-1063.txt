Over on the other side of my interests (as a calligrapher and iluminator): Many years ago I also was part of a group that was able to get a private viewing of some of the Pierpont Morgan's most well-known works of illumination (including the Maciejowski Bible). For these, we didn't actually touch anything--the person giving us the showing did all of the holding and page turning (and absolutely wore gloves.) I suspect this would be the case for any of the more celebrated illuminated manuscripts, unless you were specifically a manuscript studies specialist.
Yes! the United Kingdom National Archives at Kew Gardens is completely free and accessible to the public- you should be able to arrive there, get a reader card (for free) and then request the documents you would want to read. I don't know about 'ancient texts' or white gloves (though they have very strict rules on food and drink), but when I was studying my MA I was able to read copies of original war diaries of the Irish Guards there from Operation MARKET GARDEN, as well as the originals of several other documents, such as briefing papers from the cabinet office, operational planning resources and other bits and pieces.
