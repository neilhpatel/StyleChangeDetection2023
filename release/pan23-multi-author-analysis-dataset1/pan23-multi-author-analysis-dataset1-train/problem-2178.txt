Some Arkansas schools started notifying parents in August that they are proposing to ban any teaching related to CRT, Diversity/Inclusion, Social Emotional Learning, and Oppressor vs. Oppressed. School Boards would ask the district attorney to draft bans and when the inevitable uproar happens, "ends" it but refuse to respond to FOIA responses. Looking at you Conway.

A few things. She wants to give parents more choice but not students who need to know all sides of any story. She obviously will keep standardized testing. Which continues to show kinds don’t know math or how to read and comprehend. She will continue to allow cell phones in schools(hugely distracting) Another GOP who doesn’t think education is important. The continued dumbing of Arkansas. They get what they pay for.
No mutual exclusivity between asshole and curmudgeon. Indeed, the latter may only be a particular subtype of the former.
