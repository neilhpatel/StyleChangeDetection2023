Of course Romney is going to vote for it—this bill gives Utah the right to ban gay marriages as long as they recognize those legally performed in other states.
This bill is a backstop that protects the rights of gay couples to be recognized by the federal government while allowing states like Utah and North Carolina to return to their bans. It’s better than before Obergefell because it rolls back DoMA. It’s not a step forward. It’s bot progressive. It’s a backstop against SCOTUS, and I pray we never need it.
I’m discussing the normalisation of “traditional values” in regards to family and marriage - so you are correct - Mesopotamian religion was polytheistic, but marriage, as I have stated in my prior comment, was more “practical” in a sense.
So? I’m not gonna give them a Medal. They have voted for plenty of things over the years that were so horrendous and appalling. Yeah, this is nice for us gays, but these people are traitors.
