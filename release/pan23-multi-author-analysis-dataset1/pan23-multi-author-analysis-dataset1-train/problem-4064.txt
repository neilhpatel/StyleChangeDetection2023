And then, of course, there were indeed archetypal bandit gangs of vagabonds--maybe already outlaws where such a status existed. Feodor Glowaty's family/gang at the end of the 15C Poland lasted longer than most (about three years), so it's a good example of the sort of "career bandit" life as opposed to a one-time robbery or a landed robber-knight. Glowaty's group, which had about twenty members at its height, became most infamous for a massive robbery of the Rozgonyi estate, including making off with a large number of horses. They also engaged in attacks on merchant caravans and locals moving between village to village. And most famously, in 1493, they held an entire town for ransom as punishment for capturing and executing two of their members. Well, they tried to, at least. It's pretty clear the town didn't pay.
My impression is that medieval England, especially after the Norman Conquest, was less affected by robber knights than most of the continent, owing to the strenh of royal power, royal law courts, and a well-armed and numerous free peasantry. Would you say this is a fair statement?
Although it is fairly common for cultures to equate criminals with dangerous animals, the link in medieval Europe between bandits and a type of animal particularly known for attacking travelers and traveling in packs is both strong and specific. Travel in the Middle Ages was dangerous business, and it wasn't just a case of humans versus animals and environment.
