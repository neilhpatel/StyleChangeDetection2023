I believe the exemption is only for certain exemptions (executive, administrative), so it may depend on your role. Off the top of my head I believe the minimum salary does not apply to the outside sales exemption but I think there are others as well. Not sure if this applies to your situation so it's definitely still worth looking into if you think you are being underpaid.
The tasks are primarily computer/finance related. When I dug into it, it seemed like the exemption status depends on the kinds of tasks, right? How much detail do you want?
For the kind of work you describe, in general, you must make twice the State minimum wage (and maybe a higher local minimum wage if you have a county or city ordinance) and have direct managerial authority over two or more employees UNLESS you qualify for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Order 14, or some other exemption.
I am salaried. I don't do any record keeping of hours. And I have an email from an HR person saying "you are salaried/exempt.".
