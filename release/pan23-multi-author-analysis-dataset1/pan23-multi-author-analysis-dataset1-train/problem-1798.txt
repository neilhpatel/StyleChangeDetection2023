2) The second video is just... wow. Like, Graham's whole argument is that 'republicans can't be racist if they elect a black man.' It's literally only a shade away from 'I'm not racist I have a black friend.' Third video is Lindsay coming almost to tears claiming that if Walker fails, it's "deterring black people from running for/getting involved with the republican party." Like it's some kind of liberal conspiracy that democrats' only goal is that. It has nothing to do with how clearly unqualified he is (see point 1), nothing to do with his hypocrisy, and not at all anything to do with the fact that republicans clearly want a yes man to pull a lever in congress and keep around as 'their black friend which means they can't be racist.'.
Republicans bleat continuously they despise affirmative action because nothing should matter but merit. But here is Walker, whose only use to the GOP is that he is black, and who is otherwise unfit for anything more demanding than chasing a ball around, and they think that absolves them of racism??
