If my son had half as many noble traits as my grandchild Yi San, we wouldn't be in this mess. And Yi San's only 10! He's got a good head on his shoulders, listens well, reads well, understands well. He's everything I could hope for, a shame we had to go through a little trouble to get here. Worry not, he'll make a fine King when I'm gone. Heavens know I'll be watching him from above.
Just remember that your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great had to deal with his own bit of family drama, and everybody absolutely fucking loves that guy. Besides, we've all heard the rumors about your great-great-great-, so your alternative is beating your son to death and then pretending like nothing happened. Absolutely unacceptable.
I will admit there are still lands in the realm to develop. Hamgyong Province for example could use some polishing. Who's bold idea was it to relocate troublesome officials and individuals to that hinterland. Anyways, for now, in times of peace, I'll seek to continuing tax and class reform. Besides, what barbarian would dare attack mighty Joseon? Got bigger fish to fry in the form of my own son.
Has Your Majesty considered some _less fatal_ form of punishment, perhaps torture with water, a dark cell or another practice that will allow for his physical inviolability, while correcting his behaviour?
NTA. Yes youâ€™re his father, but you are also a king. Sometimes, you need to protect your people from even members of your own family. It sucks, but you need to make incredibly difficult decisions for the good of the country as a leader.
