So child 3 had an attorney for that case, he needs to get clarification from his attorney on what happened as a result of his petition and what that means for his ownership of the property.
Hmmm. Thank you for your thorough responses. I can provide a little more context regarding Child 3. The father did not want Child 3 to have any ownership of the property because he didn't want the mothers of Child 3's multiple children to "go after" Child 3 for his share of the asset. However, there was a "understanding" between the father and all three children that, when the father passed away, the property would be sold and Child 3 would still get his share of the cash money.
Child 1, for some reason, is arguing that the transfer is not valid because the father signed it as himself (who no longer had an ownership interest in the property) and not within his capacity as trustee of his trust.
Since the court refused to confirm that the property is a trust asset and thus owned 75% Child 1 and 25% Child 2 (according the the grant deed that was signed by the father), why go through probate?
I guess the question is: if the court refused to confirm trust ownership of the father's 50% of the property, does that automatically validate the grant deed to Child 1 and Child 2, leaving them with 75% and 25% ownership? And child 3 with nothing. Or is the father's share in "limbo" and that's why it requires probate?
However, Child 3 was "disinherited" when the father granted his share in the trust to Child 1 and Child 2.
The father created a trust and transferred his 50% interest into the trust. The successor trustee is Child 1. The trust states that the father's interest in the property that he transferred should be distributed evenly between the three children upon his death.
A few years later, the father filed a grant deed to transfer his 50% from the trust to Child 1 and Child 2. He signed the grant deed as himself.
