Exactly. In the primaries last time, trump was only getting 20-30% of the vote, but there were so many establishment candidates splitting the remaining vote that trump still came out on top. If there are too many egos in the clown car again, trump will win again.

Really? I don’t think I know a single Trump supporter that canceled their membership. Considering Trump gained 10 million MORE votes in 2020 than 2016, I’m led to believe the mythical Trump supporter jumping ship is propaganda meant to lull Dems into a false sense of security, and hence not show up to vote.
Huh? Trump fans were fucking hype in 2015. I used to pass this one pickup truck on my way to work that was littered with stickers, confederate flags, beer brands, etc. One day I walked past and all the stickers were gone, like someone had gone over it with a heat gun and waxed it clean, next day there's two fresh "TRUMP" stickers on the truck.
