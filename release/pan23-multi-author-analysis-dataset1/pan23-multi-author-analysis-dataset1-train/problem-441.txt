The white fascist are already there and have always been there, that's nothing new or a surprise, so is the gerrymandering and voter suppression. In Georgia's last election cycle it literally had the percentages of Black men voting for Warnock but not voting for Abrams. White fascist predictably voted for Kemp. But Black men who should not be supporting Kemp and Republicans did not vote in their best interests and support Abrams. Not to mention, despite voter suppression and gerrymandering Black women showed up in large numbers for Abrams. Despite suppression, young Georgians showed up for Abrams. I don't think it's yikesy at all to point out when people vote for candidates against their own interest. Your take is like, "Pinning Republicans win on poor rural voters is pretty yikesy" even though time and time again these voters keep voting for candidates that work against their interest, whether it's the poor voting for Republicans looking to cut their benefits or Black men voting for racists Republicans.
