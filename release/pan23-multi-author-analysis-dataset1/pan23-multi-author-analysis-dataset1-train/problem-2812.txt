If we threw out the election rigging gimmick that is the electoral college, which shifts an undue amount of attention to less populated / relevant “battleground states” rather than throughout our entire country. A vote for a Democrat or Republican vote in a battle ground state is much more valuable than 10,000 democratic or Republican Votes in Texas, NY, Florida or California where the outcome is pre determined. The system is rigged when a candidate can lose by 3 million votes nation wide gets to be President because of a total 20,000 votes split between in rural counties and gerrymandered congressional districts.
No argument from me. Really we could keep the system we have now and expand the house of rep. to one rep for every 30,000 people (as described by the founders) and since the number of house representatives determines the number of electoral votes it would give populous states the voting percentage they actually deserve in the presidential election as well as the influence they are being cheated out of in the house.
