Rates can go up due to accidents, yes, but perhaps your company affords you some sort of accident forgiveness which is sometimes part of certain types of policies. Yes, this would be kept in a record system and would show on what is usually referred to as a CLUE report which is the report typically used to determine premiums in regards to accident history. At least in the states I sell insurance in, accidents can impact the rate for up to five years after the accident happened. Your agent may be able to offer you some discounts or programs to help keep the rate down. For example, some companies (at least in my state) will allow you to put a device in your vehicle (usually for six months) that tracks your driving (it looks for things like hard braking, hard accelerating, late night driving) and if your driving is deemed to be favorable it can help to bring down your rate.
No lawyer will take a case like this. The other party has every right to insist on going thru insurance rather than doing you the favor of allowing you to pay out of pocket. File a claim and let them handle it.
