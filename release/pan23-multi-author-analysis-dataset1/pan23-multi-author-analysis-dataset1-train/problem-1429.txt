Its difficult to generalize on "Native Americans" since you are asking about literally thousands of groups and civilizations over a period of several millenia, but basically most American groups found that advanced (for their time) textile techniques allowed for the production of strong, durable and adaptable armor, even when metallic materials were available as was the case in Mexico and South America, or that the adaptation of local materials had much the same effect, indeed there are cases of in Alaska, or conquistadors using Aztec Ichcahuipilli's to protect themselves when their own armour proved less than ideal for the task at hand.
