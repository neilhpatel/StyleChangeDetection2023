Yup that's exactly what's going on. Which makes sense considering the property manager kept telling me "he didn't want to know about any of that" when referring to any agreement about them not living here.
ARS 13-2310 - Fraudulent schemes and artifices; classification; definition. A. Any person who, pursuant to a scheme or artifice to defraud, knowingly obtains any benefit by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, promises or material omissions is guilty of a class 2 felony.
I knew this sounded too good to be true. It always is. I'm definitely not taking part in any of this.
I will add the caveat that in some jurisdictions and circumstances, a lease can state that it can be terminated upon sale of property, but in those cases it is almost always necessary the landlord or new landlord pays the tenant liquidated or actual damages if they do.
This. You get a way better rate on a mortgage if it's for your primary residence. Pretending it's a primary residence when it's actually an investment property is fraud.
