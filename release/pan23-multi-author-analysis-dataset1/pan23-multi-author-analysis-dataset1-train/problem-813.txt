The initial stance of the early Islamic movement was not prohibition, but disapproval - and that disapproval escalated to prohibition over a period of years. The first act of prohibition was as a result of some Muslims attending prayer under the influence and reciting prayers incorrectly (in fact, turning them into their opposite meaning) - in response, being intoxicated while praying was banned. Given that Muslims pray 5 times a day, that essentially leaves very little interval for you to basically get drunk. Total prohibition of alcohol occurred later in the Prophet Muhammad's life, which was prompted by a meal among some of his followers which turned violent over a debate about immigration (the topic was a debate about the qualities of Meccan exiles versus Medina natives).
The original verse which prohibited alcohol in response to events can be read , which also has a handy Islamic theological explanation of the verse (but does not discuss the historical causes).
What a great answer. Please can you refer me to the Hadith or source relating to the final prohibition ruling (on immigration and the argument between the Ansaar and Muhajirun)? That's really interesting and I'd like to read further.
