so the group of assholes can choose to ignore him or authorize a higher minimum payment, but there's nothing about the debt ceiling that will prohibit them from using the card to their hearts desire.
so each time the other group of asshole are going crazy on the credit card, the minimum payment is going up and this one guy is like, 'hey, the minimum is higher this month, either increase how much i can spend or we'll miss the payment.'.
He is right but how do you fund government services like justice, defence, and education when their constituents (corporations are people too my friend) want the necessary taxes to pay for those services reduced year after year.
The puffed up turds always rise to the top. I've seen it everywhere, and I have been a lot of places and had a handle fandful of different roles with access to the people at the very top. It is demoralizing as hell some times.
