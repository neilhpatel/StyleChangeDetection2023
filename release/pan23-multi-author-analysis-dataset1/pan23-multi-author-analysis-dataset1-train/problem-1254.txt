Not that I think it matters, but how do you know that the buyer didn't just change his mind in the week between signing the contract with your parents and listing the house?
Generally speaking the seller is concerned with the price they will receive and doesn't care what the buyer intends to do with the property. If the seller really cares, they can register a covenant (not sure of exact terminology) on the property that is binding on all future owners -- though that may well materially reduce the value of the property. Simply including a use clause in the purchase contract with the buyer is likely pointless, as the buyer could resell the property to someone else not so bound. So that's not really a thing.
If I sell my property to someone who says they are going to build a dog sanctuary and then chooses to build a convenience store instead, or they decide to sit on the land as an investment to sell later, they are well within their rights to do so unless it is explicitly written in the contract that it must be used as a dog sanctuary.
How old are they, how is their mental health. how did they meet this man, had they listed the house for sale, how long was it for sale, were there other offers, were they represented by an agent, are there more facts that could be argued to prove fraud?
