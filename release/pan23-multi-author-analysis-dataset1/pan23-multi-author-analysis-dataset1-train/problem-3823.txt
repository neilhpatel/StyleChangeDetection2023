To start off with, Mormonism specifically was founded in an area of western New York during the early 1800s where there was so much religious fervor that it was termed the "Burned Over District." It was here that Joseph Smith had visions from the divine and founded a new denomination of Christianity.
In short, no, there were no religious leaders, much less any prophets to compare to the likes of Joseph Smith at this time. There were important religious leaders, before, during, and after, indeed who would go on to found denominations and shape American religion for a long time, but no prophets, no one quite like Joseph Smith and the Mormons.
TL;DR: 19th century America had its fair share of religious movements and new denominations being founded, but none compare to the infamous prophet of Joseph Smith. Because of his radical new interpretation of Christianity and imposition of unorthodox living conditions (forced migration, polygamy), no one compares in that time.
In short, yes. Competitors isnâ€™t quite the word, but does capture quite a bit of the spirit at the time.
