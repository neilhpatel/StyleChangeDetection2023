This disaster is on the scale of Haiti, and the Boxing day tsunami -both of which have a ballpark of deaths. My numbers with the local situation was only to highlight the scale of difference between persons reported missing, and those reported dead.
For a separate indication of how reported missing vs body counts can vary. My country (NZ) is currently in the midst of a national emergency. Several regions experienced extreme flash floods due to a cyclone that people weren't prepared for. Contact was missing or limited with multiple areas, and roads and bridges were washed away over the north island. The amount of people listed as missing peaked at around 6000, with the current body count being 11. After almost 2 weeks, the missing list is down to around 30. People are assumed to have been washed out to sea. With the sheer amount of collapsed buildings in Turkey, I would say that the count put forward is a count of the bodies that have been pulled out. I'm sure that it's not a perfect list, but it would count homeless people.
Public policy matters. Corruption takes lives even decades after the graft money has been exchanged.
