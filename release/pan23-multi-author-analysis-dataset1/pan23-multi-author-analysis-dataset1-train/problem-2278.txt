Landowning in Britain, especially circa 1910, was a big deal. Typically when discussing landowners we're talking about Peers (ie, people with noble titles), and the "landed gentry", who technically speaking are commoners, but effectively just below the aristocrats. British peers also have a system of ranking - the head of the Crawley family is an earl, which is basically mid-pack (not a Duke, but not a Viscount), and there would have been about a hundred or so in the UK at the time.
Very specifically, someone who is a Peer holds a hereditary title granted by the Crown (a Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount or Baron). Landed gentry would be just below that - baronets, knights, squires and gentlemen. Hereditary peers could sit in the House of Lords, and titles for the gentry (except baronets) weren't hereditary. Landed gentry were technically commoners and (if elected) sat in the House of Commons.
Fantastic answer! I have a follow up question though. A significant portion of the show's plot revolves around inheriting money, and money being infused into the Grantham estate via inheritance.
