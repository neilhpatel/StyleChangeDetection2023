And this gets to your question, how was it handled: if people had night terrors or other mental problems, they were treated by medicine workers through ceremony. This really is a form of medicine, these medical responses were formalized into a system of "talk therapy" among Iroquoian speakers in the Early Modern period. Here, I'll re-post some of my answer about mental health in North American indigenous medicine . The Haudenosaunee:
I'd also stress that the source you've linked to in support of the point about Roman practices is non-academic, ill-informed about the sources and the academic debates surrounding them, and clearly driven by an agenda that pushes the author to make various totally unfounded generalisations. It pretends there is "a plethora" of evidence for ancient PTSD when in fact there are only a few highly controversial passages. It asserts that the Vestal Virgins cleansed Roman soldiers returning home, but can we really imagine them ritually purifying every single one of the tens of thousands of men the Republic sent out every year? This is wishful thinking on the basis of scraps of evidence. I hope the other pages you're citing are more reputable than this one.
