That's what I mean. The pattern is ironic. It's totally misleading that they call themselves "the truth" and keep calling themselves that after the most famous Russian propaganda paper also called themselves that for decades when everyone knew it was all literal fake news. It's kind of like how Fox News will attach the "News" label to it's many opinion/infotainment shows to try to add legitimacy to the shows and then never back that up or claim it is clearly NOT news when they are questioned in court or when it actually could lead to consequences (except way worse since it's state sponsored propaganda).
I wouldn't bet on that. Would it speed up their economic decline? Sure. But their ability to commit war is based off their civilian resolve to withstand hardship, accept whatever IOU's they roll out to drive their internal economy, access manpower, and utilize their own resources.
Yes, RTL is terrible. And BILD is a fucking shitrag. But they are not completely and utterly insane, which fox is fundamentally.
