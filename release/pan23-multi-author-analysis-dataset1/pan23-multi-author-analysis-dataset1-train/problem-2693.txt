Oh they are. The GOP’s tactic is to say that since Ukraine, an entire nation of people with a nation’s usual diversity of philosophies and political opinions, has members of their army who have shown themselves to have fascistic opinions, they should drop everything to root those elements out of their army instead of concentrating on the active invasion going on. And the fact that they haven’t stopped defending themselves from Russia long enough to do so must mean the entire nation is nazis.

Incorrect. It would be the correct decision to stop aiding Ukraine. Another correct decision would be to fully withdraw from Europe and NATO.
