The long and the short of it is that eastern religions, with a laser focus on Buddhist traditions there in that thread, have been no less susceptible to war, genocide, and explosions of violence than in Abrahamic traditions.
This leads to a much much larger and longer conversation about the history of public education and history as propaganda, but in the terms of eastern religions, American and European histories don't have a long history with abuses or violence with eastern religions (the key word here is "long"). The equivalent would be classrooms in China, Thailand, and Bhutan asking why eastern religions have violent traditions but Catholic monks seem so peaceful, ergo, why are Christianity and by extension, Abrahamic religions so peaceful? Of course, Western history students with a long history of abuse from Christianity, both systematic and otherwise, know better.
Debatable. Asian countries had a very bad experience with Abrahamic people. Every historical Asian movie has the West as villain.
