"On the night of January 26, the Russian occupiers resumed attacks on Ukraine with the Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones," the report said.
Late on Wednesday, January 25, an air raid alert went off in a number of regions in Ukraine due to the launch by Russia of Iranian-made kamikaze drones.
The Ukrainian military destroyed all 24 Iranian-made kamikaze drones, which Russia used to attack Ukraine overnight.

Exactly. They aren’t fast nor stealth and they don’t really have countermeasures for AA from what I’ve read on the internet, basically just off brand guided munition but with a surprising range. And while you can effectively counter them with phased out AA tech and tactics you need a metric fuckton of old guns to cover even the important places of Ukraine which, again, is really big.
