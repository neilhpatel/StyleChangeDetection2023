Kanye is being manipulated and taken advantage of by white supremacists, they absolutely love useful idiots with mental health issues so this is right up their alley, and aside from being already-famous Kanye is also now part of an organized far right movement so it's not surprising to see followers and terrorism etc.

I don’t practice civil law, and it’s been many years since I studied torts, but this shit is becoming an epidemic and those responsible need to be deterred, incapacitated, or rehabilitated before the GOP starts committing 9/11 or Oklahoma City level attacks.
