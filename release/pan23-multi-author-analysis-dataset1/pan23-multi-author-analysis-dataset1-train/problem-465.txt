I was having major panic attacks from rage-bait reddit "news" headlines so I started reading the issues from other news sources. I found that while there was a kernel of truth in the reddit posts, they were phrased in ways to make you feel that every issue was the oncoming apocalypse. Every new law = the genocide of someone. Every trump action = he's absolutely going to become president, every CEO billionare is taking over the government right now. When you read the story, that's never the case.
Nuclear escalation. If air bases were placed in Ukraine, they'd be target number 1 for bombings. The next place that makes sense is in neighboring countries. Any country that does this would make themselves combatants if those hypothetical jets given to Ukraine attack Russian soil.
Exactly. After 2 or 3 articles on a topic, the general facts and details are repeated in others. New developments get a read but issue rewrites by others don't.
Literally true. Their job is to wear down your resistance so you give up. That's why it's important to take breaks and take care of yourself. Fighting for justice is a long fight, you can't run yourself on empty and have nothing left.
