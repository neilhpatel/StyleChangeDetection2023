The airport near me in Kerala is fully solar powered. I learnt later this airport is essentially the first ever solar powered airport in the world. That’s quite a proud thing to achieve.
Once the growing electricity demand is achieved and the grid is in place, it’s easy to convert those power generating stations from coal/gas powered to solar/alternative energy powered.
Hi there. Actually we don't usually use heaters in India. Most people use quilt in winters or wear more cloths. But Ditching coal immediately is a disaster. India is slowly but surely transitioning to renewable sources and nuclear energy. But it'll take some time.
Well if you're not refuting my statement, how could you not be in agreement that buying cheaper fuel for a country that is HEAVILY reliant on internal combustion engines would not contribute to overall savings rather than buying from other countries that would charge a higher rate?
Yep. We did. And we’re also trying to figure out an alternative payment mechanism to USD. Saving Forex will help us transition to green energy - investing in R&D for hydrogen and solar.
