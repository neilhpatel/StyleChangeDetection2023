Quite accidentally, I once stumbled upon evidence of something about teenagers in the "Wild West" - insight I wasn't seeking and was initially challenged to understand.
“Keep it. In case that’s all we bring home.” He turned to Bleda, “Hey, Bled, maybe your wife can make him a new hat!”.
The conversation sounded absolutely normal. Have I spent too much time on steppe tribes? It was a fun vignette.
Virginia City is well documented by Sanborn-Perris Fire Insurance Maps, which identity all the structures in the community so insurance brokers could estimate the price of insurance policies for the various addresses. The outskirts of town was documented as being littered with "mountain cabins" - structures that were too humble to justify the purchase of an insurance policy. These maps, the census data, and various journals and other primary sources give us the insight to our question about young teenagers in the "Wild West.".
Background: Gluckel was born in Hamburg in 1646/7 (it's unclear, as she only gives the Hebrew date, 5407) and, after the expulsion of Hamburg's Jewish community when she was three years old, grew up in the neighboring town of Altona, then under Danish rule, before returning to Hamburg at age ten.
So what was going on? Why were families with younger teenage girls living on the outskirts and families with younger teenage boys living in neighborhoods closer to the core of town?
The reason behind this disparity rests in the role teenagers could play for the economic vitality of their families. Recollections of life in Virginia City describe teenage boys as scouring the community for rags and metal to be sold to rag pickers and the junkyard. Boys were also able to earn money by running errands, delivering messages, and various other menial tasks.
