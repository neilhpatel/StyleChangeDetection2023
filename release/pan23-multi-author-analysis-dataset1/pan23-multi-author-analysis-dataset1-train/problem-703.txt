In an important sense, I'm afraid, this question is simply unanswerable. The written resources that we have for such a remote period of history are very scant, and those that do exist are pretty much entirely focused on elites and religious affairs. The evidence that archaeology offers for material culture is predominantly symbolic in nature and extremely difficult to interpret.
You speak about these daily rituals. Were they done by priests? And what exactly did they entail? Was it some kind of offering, prayer, or something completely different?
In responses to questions about Holocaust denial, AH flairs often point out that denialism is NOT a sort of history that simply arrives at different conclusions to those arrived at by more mainstream historians, but actually the precise opposite of what history is â€“ that is, Holocaust deniers start from the position they wish to reach (which, essentially, is that there are sufficient holes in consensus accounts of the Holocaust to cast doubts over these accounts, and, hence, that there is also sufficient reason to doubt the consensus view of Nazism itself to make rehabilitation of its ideas acceptable) and then work backwards to cherry-pick evidence to support their case.
