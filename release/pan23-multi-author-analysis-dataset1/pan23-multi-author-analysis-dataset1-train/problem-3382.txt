Because the khipus weren't just used for accounting, even though this is a persistent myth. Spanish chroniclers also reported that the Inca used khipus to record their histories, literature, and correspondence. While many academics used to proclaim that khipu use had stopped when the Spanish burned all the Inca khipus in the 16th century, we know now that this is not true. When the Spanish arrived in Peru and conquered the Incas, some of them tried to adapt non-numeric khipus for similar usages in the new colonial context. The Mercedarians are a religious order who were particularly involved in khipu use in the Andes. They used khipus to teach the Lord's Prayer and the catechism, and they taught the Indigenous people how to use khipus to make confessions. Herders also continued making khipus to keep track of their flocks. Some Andean communities continued to make and read khipus until the early 20th century and still use them for ritual purposes (without being able to read them) today.
Yes! The Behistun Inscription has been called the Near Eastern Rosetta Stone. Personally, I think that's underselling Behistun. Where the Rosetta Stone helped decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs with the aid of the already understood Demotic and Ancient Greek, the Behistun Inscription helped linguists decipher all three (previously unknown) languages on the monument as well as a host of other languages.
