What you're describing isn't what I'd call a "scope of work"--I'd expect something along the lines of (I'm just making this up based on my best understanding of your OP) "clean and restore to IICRC standards\ all items damaged by water from failed water heater in the garage".
Hi. Former SBA construction loan specialist here. First off you are correct that any changes to the contract need signed change orders (for this reason), secondly I would submit payment for the remainder of the contract balance and keep your receipt. Next, if he was a licensed contractor, contact the state board and ask their opinion and you can also file a complaint with them. Extortion is illegal. The shitty thing is, they can file a lien on your property for non payment but that’s not the end of the world. Hopefully you can get it resolved before that point. Lastly I’d try to find a real estate attorney in your area. They’ll be knowledgeable enough in this area to assist you. Sorry you’re dealing with this. There are some shady contractors out there. Going forward alway verify they have a valid license and always ask for their references (not google reviews) and call them to ask how the job was done and if any issues arose during the project.
