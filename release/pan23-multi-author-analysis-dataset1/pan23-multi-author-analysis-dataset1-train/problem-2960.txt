When making these reports, be calm and concise, stick to observable facts, don't exaggerate, and don't hypothesize except very carefully. "She's in her nightgown in 20 degree weather at 2 am yelling at the fence or my house -- it's not clear which -- about children and I don't know what else, something about losing? It's cold out and she's been at it for twenty minutes, I don't know if she's having some kind of mental breakdown but my kids are freaking out.".
Some police departments have what's called a community life officer/ community liaison officer, etc. Called different things in different places. Their job is to deal with things like this. Sometimes just a visit and chat with a police officer will get people to stop the behavior. The police officer will likely explain noise laws, etc. to the person.or, if they determine that the woman had mental health issues, other steps may be taken. Or, nothing may be done. However if your police department has this service, it will start a record of your problems with this neighbor.
