If the vehicles he are driving are over 26,000lbs GVWR or carry placarded Hazardous Materials (Lithium batteries being the most likely), then he would be required to have a CDL and adhere to the work/rest requirements for commercial drivers.
Is this legal? I believe there is a limit to how much employers are allowed to make you work legally, you should call your state labour department to ask, but this might not help you at all if on paper your husband is still working the same hours and the boss is just forcing him to come back by holding his job hostage.
What sort of truck does he drive? How much does that truck weigh when empty? You say he's a "manager?" What does he "manage?" Whom does he "manage?" How many people does he manage?
Practical advice, tell him to start finding a new job immediately, document every single conversation/message he has had with his boss, if you can prove the boss is refusing reasonable demands then this falls under constructive dismissal (in fact the entire thing could the boss trying to get him to resign) and you can file for unemployment, remember to file wage claim afterward if the boss hasn't paid for all the overtime.
He's not required to go in. He can always say no. The employer doesn't have to keep employing him, though.
