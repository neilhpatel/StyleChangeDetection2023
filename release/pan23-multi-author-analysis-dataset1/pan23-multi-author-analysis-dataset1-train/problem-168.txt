You have no idea how much I appreciate your help 🙏 Thank you i wish you nothing but the best i wish i could give you something in return but just know that youve given me hope and the will to fight for my son. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Yes thank you again you have been a Godsend. Im skeptical as well since i have a feeling they must’ve told her they were going to contact me and she told me before they could so it wouldn’t look like it was a secret idk but as soon as i hear from legal aid or as soon as i make a move I will update the post. Thank you 😊.
You are fighting an uphill battle attempting to go from supervised visitation only to full custody, particularly with allegations of abuse. Have you any convictions in this regard? Did you have a lawyer for the original custody hearing? it cannot be overstated how badly you need a lawyer to navigate this. realistically, it doesn’t sound as if she is necessarily negligent, given it seems she had no idea of the abuse and reported it immediately. Even if CPS take the view she is unfit, if there are concerns about you being abuse they may place the child with foster parents or another family member. This is why you need to speak to a lawyer before you do anything else.
