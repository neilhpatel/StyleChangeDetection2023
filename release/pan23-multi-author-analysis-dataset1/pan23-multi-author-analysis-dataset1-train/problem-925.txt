In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
What do you mean? Has the pendulum already swung back from Republicans sucking because they barely won the House and lost the Senate and lost the Presidency previously? That law to allow smoking in the Capitol building must be impressive.
Yeah, legitimately surprised. There are plenty of "pro-corporate" Dems who are against LaSalle for all of his other horrible positions.

Journalists and gov’t officials have been looking into these CPC scams for decades – and by all accounts these are criminal operations supported and funded by an equally corrupt GOP diverting millions $$$ of public taxpayer dollars that should go to reproductive health care for millions of women instead of anti-abortion profiteering centers.
Especially disappointing considering LaSalle’s ruling in favor of the rightwing Orwellian named “crises pregnancy centers” (CPCs) scam i.e., rabid anti-abortion agenda falsely presented as “counseling” while fraudulently freeloading off the taxpayers dime for the same.
That Jefferies doesn’t find LaSalle's record of anti-abortion, anti-labor, anti-progressive rulings the least bit troubling - enough to give LaSalle’s rulings a closer look to confirm whether such concerns are warranted is a let down.
Just from a surface look alone in this and similar articles it is apparent that LaSalle's pro-conservative record calls his impartiality into question - at the very least.
And unless new information arises I find their concerns to be believable especially in light of LaSalle's other rulings and opinions.
