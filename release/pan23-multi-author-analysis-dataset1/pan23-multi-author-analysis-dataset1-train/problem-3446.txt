Did you get a letter from the landlord (or their lawyer ) or a court summons/unlawful detainer? If what you got was from court you MUST file a response right away. It’s usually within five business days. If you don’t file a response in time then you automatically lose the case and you get locked out by the sheriff within a few weeks and you have an eviction on your record which is horrible. Try to find some legal help but honestly you can just go to the courthouse and fill out the paperwork yourself. You can even get the fee waived. Also, go right away to when ww.housingiskey.gov to apply for emergency rental assistance to pay the back rent. It’s really not hard and I believe the landlord cannot evict you if your application is being processed. There are a ton of resources for tenants in California right now. Try to find some free legal advice too. Do everything.
If, on the other hand, she just put you on the list of the occupants of the apartment, but only her name was on the lease as "lessee" (in which case your signature shouldn't be appearing on the lease) then you should be off the hook, and you can explain that in court.
Hi. I believe the notice was from the court. Thank you for the heads up. Also my mom told me she applied for rental assistance maybe 2 weeks before we got this notice. The complex was actually affiliated with it and knew that she applied but I suppose still went through with this eviction and suing process. Do you know if they're allowed to do that? I'm living in North Carolina by the way.
