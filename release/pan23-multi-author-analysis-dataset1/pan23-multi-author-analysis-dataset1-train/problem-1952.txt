No. It was from a time when we didn't have a standing military, as we do now. It was also from a time before we had a state national guards. Since I agree we "need to accommodate SOME temporal fluidity in constitutional interpretation," it's reasonable to be able to say what was once necessary is now not, and what was once a benefit is now a detriment. I would say fully disarming people is prohibited by 2A, but banning particular arms (eg, AR-15s) is fully within Congress's enumerated powers, as well as states' general police powers. For the sake of discussion, say there are 100 different types of firearms. I think Congress banning all 100 would be unconstitutional, but banning one or two, or even ten, would not. If you can still have pistols, shotguns, carbines, and even rifles, you have not been disarmed. You can still have a militia without ARs, bump stocks, etc.
