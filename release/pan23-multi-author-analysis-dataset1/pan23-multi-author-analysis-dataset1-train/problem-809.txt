are the worst offenders for puppy mills, way worse than pet stores, and they get labeled independent breeders so no one is checking them. They do the bare minimum to get their license and those animals are treated horrifically.
GOOD! Fuck puppy Mills and dog breeders that just look at these poor animals as sacks of money covered in fur.
My parents bought a dog from a puppy mill for the same reasons people want them shit down. They were told of a "puppy farm" by a friend and they took a look cuz the friend said there was a small cocker spaniel that wasn't doing well, so they went to see her and to put it lightly it was horrible! Too many dogs in a shitty concrete garage looking barn where there were just pee pads on the floor and shit all over. The dog they were looking at was the runt of the litter, afraid of people and just weak. They were wanting to get items so they could take her home and the mill straight up said if they don't take the dog they were going to essentially throw her away.
