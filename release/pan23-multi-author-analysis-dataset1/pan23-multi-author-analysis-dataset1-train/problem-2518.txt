Thank you. Also I'm a "she". I guess I wasn't as clear on my point and you cleared it up. I don't like Nancy Pelosi, but I would vote for her 50 million times before I voted for anybody on the GOP side. But you know what fucked us over with the Supreme Court? RBG not retiring the minute Obama won his 2nd term. The elderly need to get out of the way, as soon as they have security to do so. Stop waiting until you either die in the seat or get out voted by the other side. Start mentoring and supplying money to younger, more educated folks. The system is broken but they're still acting like it works like it did in the 1950s. It doesn't.
