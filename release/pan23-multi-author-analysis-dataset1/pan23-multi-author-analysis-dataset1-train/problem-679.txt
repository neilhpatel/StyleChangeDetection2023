My mother figure is in Russia. She hates the war herself, but between her mother who she has to support, her lack of personal income (is a digital artist but has to play cat and mouse to get commissions... She changed payment methods 4 times this year I think.), and her husband's inability to consume non-russian news because he cannot speak any language but Russian, she cannot get out on her own. Plus at this point, much of Russias exits have been cut off one way or another.
And whereas nobody recognizes North Korea as a democracy, both capitalist and socialist governments have recognized authoritarian socialist governments as being socialist.
You missed “won’t”. Putin spent 20 years making sure Russians focus on their lives and stay out of politics. Now that he wants them to fight lost are in a “leave us alone” mode.
Given that the "reality", or appropriateness, of any given label is created through broad recognition by outside parties (of that label being appropriate), any notion that these third parties are wrong is inherently fallacious.
I know. It took a major amount of luck for me to leave and I may very well have to come back, considering how hard it is to get a job. I knew it would be tough but the prospect of having to admit failure is looking on the horizon.
