It sounds sketchy to me. If it was to improve performance and "bond" with colleagues, you wouldn't make them sit in on a peer's class, you'd organize a workshop where every instructor can participate and it only takes up 1-2 hours at a specified date for everyone. Maybe something like have each instructor demonstrate some area they are skilled in, or possibly a mentoring program with assigned mentors and target areas to improve. If it is as you suggest, the manager probably didn't think this through properly and just threw this idea to the wind.
