When we talk about our news sources, we don't tend to talk about the political leanings of the people that run and own said news sources. And it's not just the New York Times -- look at all the networks.
It's more because the only acceptable cure to inflation in a free-market austerity framework is for the fed to raise rates, which makes lending money more expensive, which means less investment and will thereby depress wages - which is the kind of thing you need when you are part of the owning class and you just lost a couple of millions of workers to god awful management of a pandemic and taught hundreds of millions of others that you, in fact, do not care whatsoever if they live or die.
Thanks for the reminder to cancel my NYT sub. You have to contact them to do so, either by phone or by chat, which is aggressive of them. (It allows them to try and Save The Sale).
