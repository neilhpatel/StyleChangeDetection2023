I get that waiting is a good idea, but I've seen it taken to the extreme when visiting my husband's rural conservative family and hometown. For example, I met a man who literally superglued his fingers after they got amputated them bandaged them up and said he'd go to the doctor if they got infected, but didn't want to go pay some guy to tell me they're too mangled to stitch back on. My own grandfather in law put off going to the doctor so long that by the time he finally agreed to go they discovered not only did he have lung cancer, but that it had already metastasized to the point where it had completely eaten away one of his ribs (he died less than a month later.) Both of these men had health insurance, they could have made much different medical choices. It's almost a badge of honor with some of them, who can endure the most pain before they "go crying to the doctor." It is absolutely horrifying and fascinating.m.
I never tried. We've stopped talking politics after the whole anti-vax thing. I straight up told him I'm not interested in conspiracy theories and that was that. heh.
