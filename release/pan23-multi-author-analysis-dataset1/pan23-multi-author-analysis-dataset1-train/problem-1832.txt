Whether Social Security dies now or peters out 20 or so years from now who cares. It’s money you’re paying so the boomers can collect a check that you’ll never get. I’d rather they stop taking it from my pocket.

It could be fixed but when the people holding the tools are unwilling there’s little you can do.
