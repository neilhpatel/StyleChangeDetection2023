He's not recovering from Trump, he just recognizes how stupid a move this is for Trump, basically giving away credibility (I know, he has none, but he does with his supporters) with his base for a few million dollars. Trump's giving up the whole charade to sell a single bottle of snake oil, and it's not even the grift that's upsetting them, it's the weakness. He's burning his already dwindling power on a relatively small amount of money, and it's leaving a lot of people scratching their heads, especially when it was hyped with BIG NEWS. They were expecting something noteworthy or at least drama inducing, and what they got was just yet another tired cash grab.

I'm hoping beyond hope, that someone at the NFT company got lucky enough to get in Trump's ear, sold him a bunch magic bean stories about how important and valuable NFT's are, how he should enter the market and they will help him, and at the end of the day fuck him out of a bunch of money, and Trump who is so stubborn and prideful will not have the balls to admit to himself or anybody else that he got conned.
