- Unfair: “injury” (cost of app) not outweighed by benefits - the injury argument is weak, but the FTC doesn’t require both deceptive and unfair practices to move forward with a complaint - one is sufficient, and the ad, as you’ve portrayed it, is certainly deceptive.
You would need to track down who "them" is. You would need to consider what damages you can realistically sue for. What are your losses on this?
In general, internet companies enjoy immense liberty to allow all content to be posted online provided that they remove content after a particular instance of it has been reported as illegal for one reason or another. Essentially, the law argues, it’s not Google who’s misleading the consumer but the 3rd party who creates and posts a misleading ad.
Edit: Also, I’ve just seen that I’ve misinterpreted your post - it’s unlikely that you could successfully sue Google for someone else using their ad platform illegally unless they continue to run the exact same ad after a decision has been made to legally define it as deceptive/unfair. Frankly, even if the same ad gets run, and if the company re-uploaded the ad in a second interaction with Google’s ad platform, Google is still likely insulated from liability.
