I know the bed itself is worth far more than $750, however he never paid for any of this furniture. It was allocated through our communityâ€™s emergency council and he never paid a dime, the rest were gifts from our current landlord. Does this have any play in the situation?
Statute NCGS 42-25.9 says: "If any tenant abandons personal property of seven hundred fifty dollar ($750.00) value or less, the landlord may deliver the property into the custody of a nonprofit organization regularly providing free or at a nominal price clothing and household furnishings to people in need, upon that organization agreeing to identify and separately store the property for 30 days and to release the property to the tenant at no charge within the 30-day period.".
were the pieces of furniture contributed by the landlord gifts to your former roommate, or were they furnishings for the apartment that your former roommate was allowed to use without the rent increase normally associated with a furnished apartment? Maybe clarify that with your landlord.
