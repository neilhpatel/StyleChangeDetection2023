The Japanese priorities were the battleships and aircraft carriers, Oahu's land-based air (more on this next), then cruisers and other warships. Cargo ships, repair ships, shore facilities, and other similar targets were at the bottom of the list. In practice, virtually no Japanese pilot intentionally targeted these objectives.
Frankly its staggeringly good luck that the naval yard wasn't ruined for longer. Specifically in 2 places. 1010 Pier and Drydock 1.
The other notable events occurred at Drydock 1. The largest drydock the US had access to in the Pacific at the time and important for allowing repairs without requiring ships be sent back to the West Coast as often and losing them for extended periods. It was occupied during the attack by the battleship PENNSYLVANIA, and the destroyers CASSIN and DOWNES. After unsuccessful attempts to torpedo the door to the drydock, the ships came under bombing attack. 1 bomb destroyed one of the 5in gun casements on PENNSYLVANIA, while another struck between the 2 destroyers, rupturing DOWNES fuel tanks and starting a serious fire. The decision to flood the drydock though only spread the fire more, and ammunition and torpedoes began to explode, wrecking both destroyers and even damaging the forecastle of the PENNSYLVANIA. The battleship survived with just modest damage and was back in California in January 1942. But the destroyers were in essence total losses and would take much longer to salvage, and it is in part a good deal of luck that their much larger dockmate was able to move out and clear the drydock following the attack.
