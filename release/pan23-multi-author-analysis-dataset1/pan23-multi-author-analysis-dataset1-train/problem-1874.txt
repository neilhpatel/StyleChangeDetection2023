The more news that are coming out about the Furuvik Zoo, the worse it looks. I highly doubt that they will able to keep their remaining chimpanzees after this.
So, with all of this in mind, I highly doubt that the zoo will be able to keep its remaining chimpanzees now – and it’s possible that Furuvik Zoo will not survive at all. Besides chimpanzees, the zoo also houses orangutans, and I feel that at the very least, both the chimpanzees and orangutans will need to get new homes at another park. Other than the great apes, Furuvik is actually a rather small zoo though, with mostly domesticated animals and a few small and harmless wild animals – the apes were the zoo’s greatest attraction.
So 2012, 2017, and 2022. That's 3 deaths in 10 years. You are exaggerating that time period out to include a 5 year period before that and then calling me out on exaggeration. Jesus man, take a look in the mirror.
They're definitely going to lose access to a huge chunk of their difficult animals after this, it's a good way to ensure your zoo only has Desert Foxes and Flemish Giant Rabbits , they're going to likely be blacklisted by a lot of zoos from receiving those animals ever again.
They are indeed. And I don't know the configuration of the space they escaped into, so I can't say it would have been easy to tranquilize them. However, tranquilizing escaped animals with dart guns or with food is a common technique that competent zoos often employ with escaped animals. So I'm just saying it's surprising that they killed four chimps instead of taking a less extreme measure.
