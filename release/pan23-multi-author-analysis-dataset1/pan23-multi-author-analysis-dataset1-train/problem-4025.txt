Regarding the legal aspect of this, IANAL but am a spring semester 3L. Regarding work, it could constitute intentional interference of your professional relationship aka tortious interference. If you don’t get your job back, try to gather paperwork that would estimate or project your expected wages (pay stubs for example). Your offer letter would be great too if it says your hourly rate/stipend amount and the expected amount of hours worked or a termination date. If things smooth over with your employer, then fine. But pay attention to whether their disposition towards you changes. Adverse employment actions (being put on probation, given a formal warning, being fired if they don’t take you back, etc.) could add to your damages.
Definitely would reach out to your school counselor and advisor to apologize and request this be corrected immediately as well as I would CALL your boss IMMEDIATELY request a personal meeting with them, explaining -- I would say it as such. "Regrettably my former partner contacted you with an obscene remark and the guise that I am quitting through my personal email as I had stepped away from my computer. This person is no longer present in my home nor are they welcome back and I would like to deeply and sincerely apologize for this unprofessional matter. I would very much like to retain my present internship if you'll allow me to and promise that this sort of incident will not occur again going forward.".
