It's also worth pointing out that part of the background to this was that the Democrats also shot themselves in the foot on multiple occasions too. While I won't get into the details of the 1876 election and recount here - it's better suited for a top level question - their ambitious move to rush Colorado into the Union in August for her 3 electoral votes that were widely believed would be won by Tilden was a disaster. Instead, Republicans used the late entry only 3 months prior to the election to let the Republican controlled legislature choose the electors - shockingly enough for Hayes - rather than determining them via a popular vote. There was also the bungle of Democrats deciding to attempt to bribe the genuinely independent Supreme Court member of the commission - as it turned out, the only vote that mattered in the multiple canvasses - with a Senate seat, only to have him promptly resign from the Court to take the seat and be replaced with a reliable Republican vote. This doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of all the mistakes made once they'd taken over the House in a landslide in 1874 and the mediocre campaign, but suffice it to say that they could logically blame themselves for blowing it rather than view the results as a sign of continued Republican dominance - meaning that they had every reason to believe the next election would turn out differently, and that probably played a role as well in their willingness to settle things peaceably.
But let's start with the contemporary viewpoints in the chaotic two months between the recounts of the three Southern states still under Republican control (Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina) that resulted in moving 20 electoral votes from Tilden to Hayes and the eventual convening of the Federal Electoral Commission in late January 1877 to begin sorting out out the mess, partially because it was the peak of the potential for violence and also because predictions of the apocalypse are always fun reading. From Downs:
Do you have a recommendation for further reading regarding the 1800 election, particularly Jeffersons decision to preside over the senate and what that prevented?
Thank you for this great answer. Follow up question: what question do I have to ask for you to discuss the election of 1800 and the political crisis that followed?
