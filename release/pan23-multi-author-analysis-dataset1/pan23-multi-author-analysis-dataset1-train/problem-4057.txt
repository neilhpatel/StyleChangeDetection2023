The only advice anyone here can give is to try to focus your efforts on finding ways to enjoy living without resorting to teenage edgelord "I have a dark sense of humor" behavior, and stop doing potentially illegal shit.
Who took your PC? Most likely they would of showed up to your house to execute a search warrant to seize that property. They wouldn't just leave that in your possession and if they had enough probable cause to charge you, you would of been arrested by now, not a year later and counting. Since you went on the dark web, with basically an open access to any for your information, someone from the dark web probably got ahold of your address, which could explain the letter. Now let this be a wake up call to stay off that stuff and be a good citizen so you dont cost yourself citizenship. And I'd advise you to tell your friends the same because your young and ignorant. Which makes you vulnerable to make bad choice either knowingly, negligently or carelessly..which is enough intent to make you criminally liable. Hope this helped. Behave yourself now.
