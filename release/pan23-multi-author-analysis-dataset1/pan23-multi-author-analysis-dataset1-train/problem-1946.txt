That may sound flippant, but its also true. Who is doing the discussing has a big impact on how and what things are discussed. We focus on the things which matter most to us and that we can relate to. If you are Chinese, the is a big deal. If you're american, you've probably never heard of it. Why would you?
It's also worth noting that, in terms of studying "colonialism" as a concept, it really does make sense to start with the European colonial expansion, as that is essentially what set forth the blue print that Japan would attempt to follow in it's colonial ambitions.
But wait, there's more! Another reason Japanese, or Russian, colonialism isn't discussed as much has to do with the accessibility of information. Most of our primary and secondary sources on the Japanese colonization of Korea are written in Japanese or Korean. Not many English speakers interested in discussions of colonialism are fluent in either of those languages. Those who are fluent, tend to have interests other than colonialism. If you can't access, understand, the sources, you can't discuss them. If you can't discuss the sources, you're not going to be writing academic papers on them. If papers aren't written about them, they won't be considered important and included in more general courses.
