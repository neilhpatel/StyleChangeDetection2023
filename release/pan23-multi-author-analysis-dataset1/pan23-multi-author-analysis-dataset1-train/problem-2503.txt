I am not sure, I guess we will have to have that discussion.. honestly they were on mixed terms prior to the accident in the first place. Long story short she did not have her life together and was not a great mom to him (he is the youngest by about 15 years) and he lived with our other brother for most of his teen years and he practically raised him. More recently our mother started to get her life together and wanted to be part of his life again and he was torn between wanting that mother-son relationship and also feeling like it was too late, so they had a lot of heated feelings. When we found out she had gotten power of attorney we were surprised but interpreted it as her trying to firmly assert herself as his mother and really be there when he needed him, so it is a blow to find this out now and I imagine he will need some careful consideration. Thank you.
I guess she didn't pretend to be your bother, so maybe not identity theft, but it is certainly fraudulent, and your brother isn't going to be let off the hook for the car loan without your mom being charged with a crime. The finance company needs proof that this isn't just buyer's remorse or a scam or something.
