That's a great break down thank you. Growing up by the Letchworth, a camp there seemed to be a very nice place to be sent. From what I understand the Japanese Americans were living in much worse conditions. The reports I've seen say health care alone was lacking. I also haven't heard of the Japanese having that amout of freedom. I'm getting the feeling though that my question is tippy toeing the line of the subs rules. The answer is a subjective answer. Thanks for the info.
To clarify, are you looking primarily for information on treatment of German POWs, with a comparison of conditions in the Japanese-American concentration camps a secondary question, or is the comparison your primary inquiry?
You make solid point. I forget how much specialization these topics can have. What I'm really trying to understand without I big debate about the gov't. Is how the conditions for citizens were from want I've seen worse then that of the POWs. I guess also by exstnetion, was this the treatment Japanese POWs were given too?
