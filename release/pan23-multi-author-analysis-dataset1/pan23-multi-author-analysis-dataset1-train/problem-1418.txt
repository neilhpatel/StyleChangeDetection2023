This brings in something interesting. Does your husband not want POA because he has an issue with his mother, or does he want out because the sister is causing harm to his family?
If your husband generally makes good decisions and generally makes better decisions than the sister he may want to consider dealing with her and not the POA. There are tools like no contact orders, blocking phone numbers, hiring an attorney and demanding all communication with her go through the attorney.
Oh, wow. Okay! Now, what if we’d like to give his sister authority? She is a nightmare of a human being...she is making our daily lives a living hell by relentlessly thwarting our every decision. She has no job or kids so is focusing all of her energy on complicating every. Single. Thing. We try and do for their mom. We are sick of dealing with her and would just like to hand everything over to her. Their mom is safe in a nursing home, his sister gets the house when their mom dies, we were supposed to inherit an annuity savings account, but that’s going to be gone before she dies and it’s not much to begin with. Certainly not enough to deal with his sister on the daily. So, we’d just like to wash our hands of the situation entirely.
