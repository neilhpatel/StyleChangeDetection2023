A lot of time has passed since this happened and so taking a few more months now before speaking to a lawyer will likely have no impact. If you want to sue someone, you will ideally need to identify them (the doctors you saw/ treatments you received/facilities you were treated at), which will be difficult and time consuming to collect given the amount of time that has past.
I did wonder about that. I just got a health card for the first time in many many years. Part of my plan is to tr tho get some help somewhere. I’m sure that will entail putting me pack “on paper” so to speak..
It is possible this is within the range of treatments for whatever disorders you may have, and sadly the first step before seeing an attorney is going to be to find a therapist and/or psychiatrist you can trust because even if all of your treatment was malpractice (very unlikely) you will need current professionals to give you a current diagnosis and opine on why previous treatment was incorrect for you.
Hey I’m sorry I know that. I honestly do. Lol.. people in this thread seem to think I’m about to fly off and have a total break down or something.
