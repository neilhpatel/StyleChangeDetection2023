I am not saying this lawyer should take our case and I appreciate the time he put in and he has been paid. I came here because his responses to me signaled that he was not giving this much attention, and I get that it is likely because it isn't worth the cost, but having a driveway I can access my property to and from is worth it to me and I needed to be sure there wasn't something I was missing in terms of making my choice to proceed.
Can’t you just sue them on small claims court? You don’t need a lawyer to do that and if you have video evidence then I think it’s pretty straight forward. NAL though.
Even if all he did was write a letter you'd likely pay him as much as $1,000 between the fully understanding the situation to outline facts in his letter, receiving the response from the other side, and running the payment through his trust account.
Sure you can. This would be a vehicle liability claim, the police or OP's own insurance can give them the name of the insuring company based off of license plate info at the very least.
I have not tried this. When I called the company about this they never called back so I had a lawyer send them a letter. The lawyer and their lawyer have spoken and all I was told is they refuse to pay. How would I get a hold of their insurance company directly?
