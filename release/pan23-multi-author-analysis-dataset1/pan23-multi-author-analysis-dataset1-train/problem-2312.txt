I already found aircraft carriers completely bonkers but that is insane. Amazing that they could just build on top of these things and still be sea worthy. Very cool.
The first American warship that was actually too large to transit the canal was USS Midway, an aircraft carrier design that was laid down in 1943 but not finished until September 1945, just a few days after the Japanese formally signed the Instrument of Surrender in Tokyo Bay. American aircraft design, as I've , had to comply with the pre-war naval treaties that limited the size and number of aircraft carriers that could be built. That required tradeoffs, such as the American choice to carry larger air wings and forego an armored flight deck. The Midway class didn't need to make those sacrifices. It was the first American carrier with an armored flight deck, and did so while carrying more aircraft than its predecessors. You could consider the Midway class to be a bridge between the Essex-class carriers that were the backbone of the US fleet in World War II and the supercarriers that came later with the Forrestal class. As is still the case, lessons learned from older designs influenced newer designs.
