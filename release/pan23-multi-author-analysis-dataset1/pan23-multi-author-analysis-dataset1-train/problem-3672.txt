Norse religion is an oxymoron. There was no canon, no dogma, no clerical hierarchy, no organization structure, no infrastructure to support priests or sacred sites, and no popular participation in the pagan "religion". Instead I think it is far more apt to describe "Norse religion" as a religious tradition, which I will shorthand to just Norse paganism. Now this is ultimately somewhat Eurocentric of me, with "religion" bearing the hallmarks of Western religions like Christianity, however since your question is concerned with Christianity specifically lets just roll with it.
2. Where the Scandinavian elites converted rapidly (because of al the reasons you mentioned), the ordinary person would have taken a much longer time to become a 'good christian' (I assume). If we look for example to the mainland Europe, it can be argued that not until the Reformation (or even later) the common people started really to behave properly along Christian/Church ideals. I would assume that the common scandinavian people would not have become 'fully christian' much faster.
