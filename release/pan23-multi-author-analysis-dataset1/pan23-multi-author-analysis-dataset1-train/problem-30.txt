I would talk to the dmv and make sure it’s suspended or if there is a pending suspension. From that letter the judge is issuing a warning that unless everything, including the fine and the traffic school is done by 2/22/2022, he will lose his license for a year. I wouldn’t stress too much yet. A red light ticket is an infraction and all they care about is getting their money, and all the dmv cares about is that you get rid of that point on your license.
Have him contact the dmv and ask if his license is valid and if there is anything pending that can suspend his license like too many points, and ask if traffic school will prevent suspension. I bet it will be handled.
Also while he was getting all that sorted he had already received a letter saying his license was suspended but they told him because he has been actively going to the offices to get the problem fixed his license was reinstated. The problem is that that was a month ago and I guess a judge has given a ruling of a year suspension.
