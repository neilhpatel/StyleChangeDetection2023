Basically there is pretty much an exact correlation between women's rights and overall development. There's loads of proposed casual factors. Examples include increased productive lifespans, decreased disability, increased productivity in the workforce, more investment in children, etc.
Yea, your company might give you something. When I had my daughter, I had to use the short term disability benefits. They paid 60% of my salary for 6 weeks. I had to use PTO or sick time to make up for the rest of my paycheck. Then, for the next 6 weeks, I had to use just pto/vacation. I'm extremely lucky that there were a ton of PTO changes going on at my company and I barely had enough to cover that time (I had like 6 hours left when I went back. Had to hope my kid wouldn't get sick while in daycare for a bit because I had no PTO.).
FMLA only covers people after 12 months of employment with at least 1250 hrs of hours worked in those 12 months, at companies larger than 50 people (though some states lower the threshold), is unpaid, and the employer can force you to take any PTO or sick leave first.
They can't fire you. Big whoop. They also don't have to give you your position back. Just a "comparable" position with your regular pay.
