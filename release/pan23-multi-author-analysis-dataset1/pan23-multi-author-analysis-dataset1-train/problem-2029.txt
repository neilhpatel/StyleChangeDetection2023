I think one can have a real discussion about genuine efforts at popular history, including documentaries, podcasts, magazines, books written by journalists for a general audience, etc. There are other discussions of this on this sub if you search for them. Most historians take the view that popularization in general is a positive thing, because we believe history is important, but of course popularization that is misleading can do damage, so it is not a blank check.
But I digress. While very loud and very toxic, people who decide history is best explained by the abstractions of a video game are well in the minority. I would safely wager that historical content aimed at a wider audience - gamers, in this long-winded example - cause far more good than they do harm. I just thought it'd be fun to explain how these games are sometimes a trap for impressionable teens, such as the person I was in high school, and the thought processes behind the weird nationalism you sometimes encounter on forums for said games.
