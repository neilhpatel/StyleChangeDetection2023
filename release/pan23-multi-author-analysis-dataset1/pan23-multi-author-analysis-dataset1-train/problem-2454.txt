This is one of the things that bug me most. I haven't seen much of Australian journalists, but I used to listen to the BBC world service during my commute, and it was always astounding how their interviewers/journalists would ask follow-up questions/challenge statements, but our journalists wouldn't. It's even worse in business journalism.
If all politicians came out tomorrow and were like "Yep, we were conspiring against humanity, to enslave them, harvest their childrens adrenochrome, suppress and surveil you to make you our willing, mindless cattle and also earth is flat and hollow and we are reptilians and of course 9/11 was also our thing because we are transsexual liberal jews", then r/conspiracy would be "nahhhh, thats just a false flag statement to throw us off what they are really doing, which they also conventiently tease in every kind of pop culture media".
Have you read the bible? The bible very proudly emphasizes that they killed every man, woman, and child of a particular tribe, and praised God for it. Then another tribe. Then another tribe. The list is quite long. They are proud of it and praise God!
Another more recent example was the extensive reporting by every major network about young people “not wanting to work” in which they never ever challenged the claims of the business owners they interviewed, nor did they put in the 20 minutes of work needed to compare what these entities were actually paying people to either local cost of living or working conditions.
Genocide and slavery used to be considered very good things. The Sultans of the Ottoman empire literally gave promotions to generals who committed the best genocides. The normal way to put down a rebellion included gathering all the women and children into a church and burning them alive. They did this 50 times in one particular year. The general got his promotion because of it. I want to emphasize the Sultans never considered this a strange or bad thing.
