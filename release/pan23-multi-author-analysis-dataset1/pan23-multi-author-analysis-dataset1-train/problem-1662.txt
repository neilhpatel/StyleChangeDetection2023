Here's a bit of shameless self-promotion: I'm giving a free, virtual public talk for the Centre for Scottish Studies at noon ET on Tuesday, 23 February. My talk explores the political career of Elizabeth Stewart, countess of Arran (yes, we can talk about women in the sixteenth century having political careers!) and the way that negative tropes about female ambition have impacted perceptions of powerful women for centuries. Lady Arran is a fascinating figure; while she the most hated woman at the court of James VI, she was also powerful enough that the usual kinds of direct attacks used against other women could not be used against her, and, some literary scholars have argued that she is Shakespeare's inspiration for his characterization of Lady Macbeth.
Constable died on January 17, age 91. I think he's probably best known for his work on religious history in the central Middle Ages, writing about Cluny abbey and figures like Peter the Venerable; he also worked on the crusades sometimes ("Crusaders and Crusading in the Twelfth Century" among other things).
I have looked into the subject. Some issues of Weird Tales did find their way to continental Europe in the 1930s, according to various accounts, but there is no evidence that Hitler read them - or even read that kind of material. By the same token, though Lovecraft's former wife claims he read Mein Kampf as soon as it came out in English, there's no evidence to support that.
