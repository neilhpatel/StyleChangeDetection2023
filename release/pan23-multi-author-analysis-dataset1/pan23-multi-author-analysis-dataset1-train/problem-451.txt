Giving hugely stupid advice is why you shy away from the subreddit. There is absolutely no need for CPS here. CPS is not an agency for parents to report each other over custody disputes. It is to report abuse and neglect of a child and remedy that abuse and neglect. A parent using this as some tool to get one over on the parent is not only illegal, it is stupid. Because CPS doesn't just investigate one parent, they investigate both parents. If they find something they want to move forward with, they name BOTH parents as defendants and they have to defend both of themselves from the actions of CPS. And if CPS feels they are BOTH a danger to the child, they can both lose custody of their child. Why would anyone in their right mind invite that possibility to a situation where it isn't warranted and can be handled in a private action? It is an extremely stupid and shortsighted tactic that has the potential to disrupt and traumatize the entire family where it doesn't need to be. Also, by reporting piddly custody disputes to CPS you take away the credibility of actual issues that child might be go through in the future where CPS is actually required.
Welcome to the sub. Appeals to authority and personal anecdotes aren't particularly useful here and if you give bad advice you may be called out. Neglect has a legal definition that does not include withholding the child from the other parent. Custody disputes are not within the purview of CPS and "paper trail" isn't a reason to call.
I'm not aware of any state where it's protocol to inform CPS of custody disputes that don't involve allegations of abuse, neglect or abandonment. I wish people on this sub would stop defaulting to "call CPS" anytime there is an issue involving children. Their resources are stretched thin to begin with and you do not want them in your business unless it's absolutely necessary.
