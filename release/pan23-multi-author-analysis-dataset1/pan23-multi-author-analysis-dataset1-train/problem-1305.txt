Democrats and progressives need to make them famous, and coordinate messaging and narratives to cement the public perception that the federalist society is an extremely dangerous organization installing authoritarians into the judiciary to strip Americaâ€™s freedoms.
This won't work. President Biden or the Democrats will never going to nominate a Federalist Society judge. But when there's the next Republican president, if he/she has 50 Republicans in the Senate, they'll ram Federalist Society judges through like it's an assembly line since Moscow Mitch killed the filibuster for SCOTUS nominees.
