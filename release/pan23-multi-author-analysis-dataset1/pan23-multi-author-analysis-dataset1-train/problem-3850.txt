Clearly Dante had a much lower opinion of Islam's founding figures than he did of Old Testament patriarchs or a few later medieval Muslims. There is some controversy around the inclusion of Ali here, as it's unclear whether his sin is participating in a schism from Christianity, or merely creating a schism within Islam (as this would still be seen as sinful even outside of Christendom)--two pagans (Brutus and Cassius) suffer the worst possible punishment for their betrayal of another pagan (Caesar), so the hierarchy of sin still seems to apply outside of Christianity.
The Cluniac (i.e. commissioned by peter of Cluny) texts mentioned above are partly significant because they are reworked in the sixteenth century as part of a Protestant response to Islam in the context of the Ottoman advance into Europe. Notably Theodore Bibliander published a Latin translation of the Quran in 1543 which drew on these medieval Cluniac sources (and was heavily polemical). These protestant works - including Luther's Vom Kreige wider die Turken, 1529 - presented Islam as not only a heresy but as the scourge of god, sent to punish errant Christians and call them to reform.
