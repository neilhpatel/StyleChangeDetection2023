Ben-Gvir is courting the religious and secular right, not the ultra-orthodox. It's his first electoral rodeo, but like Lieberman and Bennett, he will soon discover that his electoral base clashes fundamentally with the Ultra-Orthodox parties.
Either he will radicalize and the right-wing will fracture, or he will become palatable and assume proper politicking, which will put him on a collision course with the Ultra-Orthodox sooner or later.
Either Ben-Gvir will move to pro-military policies and social left ideas that will put him at odds with the Ultra Orthodox, or he goes harder right that puts him at a collision course with Likud and the U.S-aligned establishment at large. Staying where he is--doing nothing and promising nothing--is the only way that this govt will survive 3-4 years. And if he does, he is politically finished next elections.
Zionism was consistently an overwhelmingly secular ideology since its inception, as well as Palestinian Nationalism. Hamas is religious, and so is the israel Religious Nationalism movement, but both represent a minority even at their peak.
