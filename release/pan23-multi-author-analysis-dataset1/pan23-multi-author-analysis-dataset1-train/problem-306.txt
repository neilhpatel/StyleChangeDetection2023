I can understand the need to keep people from misusing equipment, I can see that companies want to make sure their employees are doin the work. Yet, you know I hear the story about the worker who could handle a days work in six hours then being called out for the other two becoming more common. Really as long as the work is done, why does it matter? Really your not paying for the hours anymore but the assurance the work is done to standard. So it comes down to control. These companies just want to maintain control over their employees that they would have in the office they can't have in the home. They don't need this level of control unless the employee legit gives a reason. As long as a working quota is met by the effort of the user companies should be content with that.
In the end the job I'm talking about are folks who get paid for their efforts not just their time. Because as we all know not everyone puts in the same effort, but instead of finding better ways to ensure the work gets done businesses are pushing to violate privacy to ensure.
