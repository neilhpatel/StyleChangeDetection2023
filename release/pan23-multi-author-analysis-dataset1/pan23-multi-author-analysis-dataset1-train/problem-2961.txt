We’ve spent the last couple of hours trying to get the ball rolling on getting an executor, however, everything we’ve come across is requiring time for hearings and etc. that we just don’t have at this point.
Whoever is appointed executor will likely need to notify the landlord in writing of their intention to enter, and will need to act quickly - in many states, the death of a tenant ends the lease, and the estate's right to recover the deceased's property is similar to the tenant's own right to recover property abandoned at the end of the tenancy.
The landlord should allow the executor of the estate access to the decedent's unit to inventory it and empty it out, but should not be allowing the family of the deceased in without the executor's explicit instruction.
If the landlord inappropriately disposes of the deceased's property, denies the estate access, or otherwise acts to take possession of or to dispose of their things, the estate can sue the landlord, exactly as the tenant could have in life if their landlord kept their things after they moved out. Only the executor of the estate has the capacity to begin legal action on behalf of the estate.
