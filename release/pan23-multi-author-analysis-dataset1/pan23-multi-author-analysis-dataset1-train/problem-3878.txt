Ukraine was fucked either way and they knew it. As horrible for them as this war is, in my opinion it pales in comparison to the prospect of spending multiple generations under a neo-Soviet autocratic empire. I think most Ukrainians understand that, specially now. At least I hope so.
The 4 star generals always commenting on these threads have assured me that these equipment loses will be nothing compared to the outburst of national pride this will inspire in the Russian people to fight in this war and likely lead to a mobilization of a formidable wave of competent, well-trained troops somehow as Russians now perceive themselves as the victim of an unprovoked attack whenever I have brought up the idea of hitting military targets within Russias borders.
Waitâ€¦. Sending troops to another country to fight them can have the outcome of the opposing army fighting back and then turning it around and attacking the instigator? ðŸ¤¯ thatâ€™s crazy.
Historically speaking, russian humour is pretty hilarious. Unfortunately, it's all rooted in self-deprecation, since most of their history is just one big fucking trauma.
