You are not even allowed to critsies don erdogun Its like "matjestic inpropper behaviour"...this guy lives in the middle age and his whole family as well. Like iranian, conservative nationalist.
Are you sure you have a clue? Turkey has had terrorist attacks similar to this before the rise of the AKP, and a well documented history of instability since the fall of the Ottomans. Not every event in Turkey is the machinations of the AKP, and your comment is an idiotic reductionism of Turkish history and geopolitics.
Yes. There is a state department website where you can let them know you are traveling overseas. They will send you alerts if things escalate where you are visiting. It is worthwhile to stay in touch.
I’m not going to throw away a historic pattern and continuous geopolitical instability just to jump the gun and manipulate deaths to serve a political end in a way no different than how Erdogan cynically frames these events to further himself. Just because there are legitimate grievances against Erdogan it doesn’t mean active and long standing terrorist groups are suddenly incapable of acting how they’ve always acted.
