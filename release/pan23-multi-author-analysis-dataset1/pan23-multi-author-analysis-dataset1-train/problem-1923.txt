According to the FMCSA, when hauling crushed cars you need 4 tiedowns per stack if there's no walls to support it, 3 tiedowns per stack if you only have front/back walls, or one side wall, and 2 tiedowns per stack if you have both front/back walls and a side wall. The last is what it sounds like you mostly see. There are some trailers that come with hydraulic clam shells that are completely enclosed too but, because of the extra machinery, that also lessens the total weight of cars they can haul. The nice thing is you have nothing to tie down then.
It's absolutely an option for you all to make it clear to the company who's dispatching trucks to pick-up your scrap that you will not load anything other than gondola (that's the proper name of the scrap trailer to which you're referring) or dump trailers which contain the loads of scrap appropriately, and that you will refuse to load flatbed trailers. You could even print-up signs for your scrapyard that state you will only load gondola or dump trailers to drive the point home.
