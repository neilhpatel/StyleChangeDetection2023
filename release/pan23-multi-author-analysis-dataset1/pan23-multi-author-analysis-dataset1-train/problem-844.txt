Ok. I'm not a lawyer and am not familiar with Utah law in this area, but you might, with emphasis on the might, have a claim for defamation if you have damages (meaning that you have been harmed financially or by reputation to the degree that people are less likely to do business with you or to hire you).
If you want to get the law involved, your best bet is probably to call your local bar association or browse their website to get a consult with a defamation attorney, which will cost you a few dozen dollars. If you have any hint of a case, they'll probably suggest a cease and desist letter, which will cost you a few hundred dollars but will probably get the new station to take the photo down or prove that it was glare. If you don't have a case, the lawyer will say so and you should listen.
Probably nothing. If you were in a public place filming is legal. As long as what they did doesn't defame your character or something, there's not much that can be done on the civil side of it either.
