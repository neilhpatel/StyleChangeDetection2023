Yep and with lend lease passed uncle joe has his foot over the war time production peddle and nothing gets the MIC bricked up more then being able to mass produce there systems to replenish stock piles and nothing says jobs like getting an expanded 155 shell factory in your district.
The evidence is easy to see. His invasion of Ukraine went tits up, strenghtened NATO, renewed american interest in EE, and wrecked his country's military and prestige.
You directly implied that, had Trump been president, Putin would not have invaded Ukraine, because he could have weakened NATO in other ways. Which is FALSE. Ukraine would have been invaded either way. He WOULD have invaded Ukraine despite (or maybe even because of) NATO being weaker.
Putin did not invade Ukraine because Trump didn't win, therefore his only option was forced to invade Ukraine to weaken NATO. He invaded Ukraine because he WANTED Ukraine.
This is not a leader who is concerned about NATO and wants to hurt NATO by invading Ukraine. There is no 13D battle chess here. He wants Ukraine for his own reasons, and NATO bashing is just blabbing. Ukraine would have been invaded regadless of who was in the WH. (The only thing changed would have been the intelligence provided. The current american administration probably gave Ukraine a very good fighting chance.).
