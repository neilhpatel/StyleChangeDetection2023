For a more story-oriented approach, I HIGHLY recommend Yaffa Eliach's There Once Was A World, which depicts centuries (though with a concentration on the last hundred years) in the history and day to day life of her native town, Eishyshok.

Hi! I saw the floating feature and have been waiting for my chance to chime in with some stories from my work with my masters in history. I work with newspapers and transport history in Sweden & Northern Europe during the 19th century. During my work on my paper i have stumbled on some nuggets that i would like to share with the community. These articles were printed in the paper Stockholms Dagblad, a daily newspaper in Stockholm, Sweden published between 1824 and 1931.
