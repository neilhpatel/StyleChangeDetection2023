Just sit back and imagine Putin's non-Coronavirus plan, invade Ukraine with puppet Putin in the White House while the poors of America clap along to their "non-interventionism" , the moron will clap a long to their poverty without Putin taking control of the world from them, look at the poverty of the UK with it's democratic right to getting Brexit done!
Good. IOC needs to be backed into a corner and not allowed to do allow this kind of BS with Russia and Belarus. The fact Russian athletes got to compete under a different flag after repeatedly being caught on performance enhancing drugs is utterly stupid.
I agree. We are letting Iran, North Korea, those examples you listed,... Compete without batting an eye.
Well, russian vehicles in the start of invasion had Z shaped stripes on them to differentiate between them and ukranian vehicles since both armies used ex-soviet equipment mostly, afterwards the letter Z became a symbol of Russian invasion, with a lot of Russian civilians and public personalities Using it to show their support to the Invasion.
