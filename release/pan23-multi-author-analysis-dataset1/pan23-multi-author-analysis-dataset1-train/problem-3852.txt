These texts are great. I'm not sure if it's statewide or just Philadelphia but if he takes you to court he could wind up having to return all of your rent in this "fake apartment". My old landlord wouldn't fix my stove and I got electrocuted by it. When I complained about it (and other things) he tried to strong arm me out of the building. He sent a friend to pretend he was a sheriff. I got the ball rolling calling 311 and having a housing inspector come. Once they get involved the landlord is on the clock to fix certain safety issues. They gave him a laundry list of violations (big mice problem for one). He took me to court to evict saying I stopped paying rent (true-but the rent was in an escrow account). At the hearing he hadn't fixed anything and his rental license was for 2 units in a duplex and not my unit in the basement. They made him give me all my rent back and the deposit. All of it.
Even if you lived in the closet under his stairwell and bartered magic household chores for lodging, if you have his permission to reside there you are a tenant and protected by Pennsylvania's landlord/tenant laws, including advance written notice to terminate your tenancy and the requirement that your landlord obtain a judgment in court before excluding you or removing you.
No, that's not how that works. Do you have a written lease? If so, look at the lease to see what the terms of your tenancy are. If not, you're considered a month-to-month tenant, and either of you can non-renew with 30 days written notice.
This is separate from eviction, which would require him to take you to court alleging that you breached the terms of the lease (e.g., you didn't pay rent). How long this takes depends on a couple of things, but at least a couple of weeks.
