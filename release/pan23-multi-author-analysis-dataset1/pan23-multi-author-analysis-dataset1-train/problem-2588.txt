I absolutely despise monarchy, but the king of Jordan saw the writing on the wall during the Arab spring and voluntarily abandoned his absolute power. Still shouldn't exist, but gets style points.
Everything is done with the idea to preserve the state for as long as possible, through the support of the nobles, the common people, other states, and the Church (which was still important in the 1400s-1500s), because the regent emerged as a man amidst the chaos of anarchy or civil wars; he's a man that guides the state towards a better state (sorry for the wordplay) and transitions to the republic, kinda like Publicola in the Roman Kingdom.
Big NO on that one. They refuse to take in more refugees, including those they left behind after the war of 67. This is a big reason why there is such a problem even. If Jordan owned up to its actions of attacking Israel twice, we wouldn't have had the refugee problem that we have.
Oh yeah, Jordan fought a war with Israel half a century ago that create a refugee problem for them, never omit this part.
You are also not mentioning that Jordan refused to give the Palestinians their own country between 48 and 67. Why is that?
