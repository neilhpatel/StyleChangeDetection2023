UPDATE: so it turns out that there was more than one email. Along with the cease and desist, there was some paperwork marked “This is a court order” and “This is not a court order “ that basically said she was requesting a restraining order but a temporary one was denied until the court hearing because “there wasn’t sufficient evidence to show abuse”(no kidding). But that court date has already passed and I haven’t received any other notifications regarding the issue. So my questions now are: since I failed to show, is the restraining order granted? And is there a warrant or anything like that for me missing that court date? Included in the files was a request of back pay for rent, which I don’t think I owe, but I think she was just reaching for anything she could try to get, but does a failure to appear on that date mean I have to pay that as well? I know you mentioned that email was not an official way to summons, so I guess I’m just not sure of the consequences(if any) of missing this court date.
Definitely not. Even responding to the e-mail, showing that you've been constructively notified, is not adequate process service.
