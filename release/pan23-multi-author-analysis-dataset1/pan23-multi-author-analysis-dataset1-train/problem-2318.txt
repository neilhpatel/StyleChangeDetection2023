To some degree this has already happened though. NATO has moved tens of thousands of troops to bases bordering Russia. Most of the countries you name currently have way more foreign troops on their soil that is normal for peacetime. They're ready in case Russia amps the crazy up even higher.
Unprovoked? Your either employed by the FSB or your delusional, fucking unprovoked my arse , they have threatened everyone and their dog whilst performing genocide in a sovereign nation they invaded.
A good point. While our various countries have been telling people NOT to go to Russia, there are still going to be SOME who have to go for various reasons, or whom are already there and cannot leave for various reasons. And we should not leave them without the aid of their embassy if something should happen.
Have you looked at Russians history In the Baltic’s… they have good reason to hate Russia… and if Russia wins or gets away with this, Ukraine is very high up on their target list(based on the same intelligence agencies that earned us of the invasion, Russia was originally planning on invading the baltics first before Maiden happened)… for them this is a literal matter of life and death, so yeah they are going to take a very hard line, and they aren’t going to take kindly to countries that Stand neutral or on the side of a country that is an active threat against it.
Saw a video a bit back, interview with a US commander. His force is in Romania, on the Ukraine border. Said they're maintaining full combat readiness, could be headed to the front within an hour or receiving the order. All that's not yet happened is the order being sent.
Additionally the US didn’t support Pakistan. US Congress Imposed an arms embargo on Pakistan, journalist reported on the atrocities, protestors blocked ports to prevent Nixon from supporting pakistan and the diplomats in the US were allowed to defect.
