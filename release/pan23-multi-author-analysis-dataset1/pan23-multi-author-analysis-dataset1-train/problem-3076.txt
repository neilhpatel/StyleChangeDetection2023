Dunno if you know this, but some kids get beaten really really badly for less than being trans. Some parents might not take too kindly to their kid not being what they want. Even if the parents arent physically abusive, being a child or teen and being told that who you are is wrong over something you can't help is harmful. It leads them to thinking " if I can never been good enough or fixed, why should I keep living? Whats the point if no matter how hard I try I'll still be followed by these thoughts and feelings. I would be better off not being a disappointment. I would be better off dead".
