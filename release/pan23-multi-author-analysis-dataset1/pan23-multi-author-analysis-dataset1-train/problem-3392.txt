In a comparable situation where you are under anesthetic or other mind-altering substances the duty of care states that you must be released into the care of another competent adult. This would also mean that a doctor, knowing the elevator just broke, could not simply walk back in his office and lock the door with his next client if his previous one was mobility impaired because that would create a issue of wrongful detaining.
This is correct. VA hospitals do indeed have an actual police force, not security guards. They do have the power to charge individuals for committing a federal crime on government property.
Inpatient psychiatric facilities often have special exceptions regarding emergency exits. They still have to have them, but they often are allowed to keep them locked for patient-management reasons, so long as they have controls in place to ensure that people can actually exit in an emergency and are not trapped in the building. That often means having someone on watch to unlock the doors as needed, or having them on a timed lock and alarm system.
