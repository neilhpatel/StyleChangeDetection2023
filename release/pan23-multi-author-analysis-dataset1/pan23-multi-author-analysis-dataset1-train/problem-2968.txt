The concession speech and accompanying congratulatory phone call to your opponent are not formal requirements that must be met for the certification of election results to move forward. They are merely a polite tradition that is expected of functioning adults to observe once the tabulations are complete- a tradition which right wing conservatives have abandoned in the Trump era. Anytime they lose, it just automatically means the election was rigged or somehow stolen, despite a complete lack of tangible evidence. Whether or not Lake concedes is not relevant to the process- it is not an indictment of the election itself, mere an indictment of her own lack of maturity. It's a non-issue.
That makes the "news" outlets pushing the "fraudulent election" narrative complicit in any potential insurrection, or politically motivated violence that follows.
What are you guys talking about? when someone does great journalism I never see any comments of the “‘the media”’did a great job here” variety. You guys are oversimplifying and over reducing as much as I would be if I reduced your input here to “just commenters taking an adversarial position in an attempt to score lowinfo Internet points”.
