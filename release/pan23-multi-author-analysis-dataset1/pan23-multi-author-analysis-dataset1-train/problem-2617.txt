What might come closest is writing by the Classical Liberal economists and their advocacy for unregulated ("Free") economic markets, who described and advocated for the policies which would little under a century later lead to the social conditions in turn described by Marx and Engels. The Classic Liberal authors which might interest you would probably be Adam Smith ("Wealth of Nations") David Ricardo ("On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation," although parts on Comparative Advantage are only the ones that you need to look at for lasting impact on economic thought) and if you really want to dive deep, Jean-Baptiste Say's commentaries on Adam Smith (which notably challenge Smith's advocacy of the Labor Theory of Value — a theory which would be picked up again by the Communists — and instead argued in favor of a strictly utilitarian price interpretation).
In that book, Hirschman cited many authors. Many of whom would be what you looking for. They are, after all, supporters of capitalism. And you would also find authors that would be more closely aligned to Marxist thinking.
