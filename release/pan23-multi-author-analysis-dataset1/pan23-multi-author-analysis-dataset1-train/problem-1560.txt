Prescriptions aren’t limited by the state in which the prescriber is licensed. They can write a prescription and it can be filled in any US state. The two biggest limitations would be that some states such as NY only allow electronic prescribing (no written prescriptions allowed) and prescriptions for controlled substances that have to adhere to state requirements. Outside of that, it’s within the discretion of the pharmacist to refuse to fill a prescription they fill to be inappropriate for treatment or illegitimate in any way, such as for controlled substances.
This is at the discretion of the pharmacist and not typically prohibited by law. Many pharmacists do refuse to fill out of state prescriptions for controlled substances due to the risk of fraudulent behavior, but can legally fill it if they are comfortable with the circumstances and feel them to be legitimate.
Of course. Note, you may have to pay completely out of pocket for it and it might not be cheap. But imagine someone on vacation in the US gets in a car accident. They aren't going to check for citizenship or residency before providing treatment, which would include medication, right? Doctors may ask for insurance/payment up front for the appointment, but they aren't going to check to find out where you are a citizen from. Note, depending on the prescription you are wanting it may take longer to get than you hope. If you are already diagnosed with something, a new doctor may or may want to rerun tests which can get expensive. I think the question here is what is the COST not can you get the prescription.
