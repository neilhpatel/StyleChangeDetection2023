The Soviet Military Tradition is BIG on "War as a Science". They have tables for when to attack and when to retreat and how much artillery to throw at an problem, war is a high school math problem when it comes to decision making. A general who follows the math will never be punished. So, the general will always follow the math on the table because deviating is a great way to get fired if your instincts are wrong even once. While there's an awful lot of wiggle room in NATO doctrine for commanders to not throw troops into an attack that high school math says should work if there's something else up, that's just not how Russian command structures work.
Seriously? I'm frigging cracking up laughing. That dude needs his head examined in a hospital on the sixth floor, and you know what happens on the sixth floor.
Officer. It is completely unreasonable that I should have to return all of my stolen goods. I like some of the stuff I stole very much. We will have to come up with a middle ground here.
