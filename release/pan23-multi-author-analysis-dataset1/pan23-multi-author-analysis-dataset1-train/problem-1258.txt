The problem is that all the other places on the internet that tell this story, if they cite their sources, lead back to that article, and that article only says that it has the information from one person: Sorin Calinescu. I've done some research on Calinescu, and he does indeed exist and work at the Metro construction agency, in a very high-up position, but I can't find reference to him before 1989 other than on his personal profiles, which I won't share, because I don't mean to doxx him.
Last night I watched the 1947 film . Toward the end, a high schooler gets drafted and gives a melodramatic goodbye to Shirley Temple's character, who basically rolls her eyes because "the war is over," and he replies something like, "Anything could happen, I could trip on my bayonet." So it's clear that it takes place, if not in '47, definitely after the end of the war. Were young men still being drafted at that time? the answer is no, but I wondered if there was more to it.
It still requires some interpolation because neither country followed European-classic-diplomacy norms, but generally speaking.
