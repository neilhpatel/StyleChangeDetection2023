Categorically insisting that an institution is above investigation for alleged misconduct simply because the institution's identity makes it a target for bigotry and bad-faith actors is a poor argument. If you applied this principle universally, religious institutions and minority-led organizations would not be subject to legal investigation when their own employees report misconduct.
