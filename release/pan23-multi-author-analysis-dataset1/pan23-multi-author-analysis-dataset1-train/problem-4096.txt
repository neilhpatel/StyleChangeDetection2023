No problem. I do love the Cheese and the Worms, the way he recreates Menocchio's bookshelf and draws from the ideas that could be found within those books is a stroke of genius. But is any of it true? How much does it matter? That's a big part of the fun with micro-history, and particularly Ginzburg. He writes right on the boundary of fact and fiction where the distinction is so blurred the reader becomes as important in interpreting his ideas as he was in interpreting the primary sources. Enjoy!
It's not a typical work of microhistory in the strictest sense — it focuses on a few different individuals and it follows the silk dress at various stages of its development (beginning with a silkworm) — but it does spin a larger narrative about transatlantic networks and c18th material culture from a single work of art.
Brilliant. thanks for this. I guess after the Witches Sabbath, and especially the cheese and the worms, as fun of a read as it was, I realized I'm constantly on alert to see where he is "running too far" as he's such a talented writer it was sometimes harder to see where those places were (I found LaCapra's criticism especially on point). In any case it definitely sounds like it can be an interesting read.
