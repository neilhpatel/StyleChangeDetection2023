Ahoy - u/restricteddata gave a concise and brief answer to this a few years ago. You can read his answer here:
However, biology also falls apart into many different and independent disciplines, such as anatomy, natural geography, cellular theory, ethology (study of behavior), biochemistry, pre-Darwinian theories of evolution, etc. It takes until Darwin before all these fields can be tied together, because evolutionary theory allows us to use the findings of one discipline to explain those of another (such as anatomy can be explained by behavior and evolutionary pressure). Then Mendel helps to tie evolutionary theory together with genetics. But before Darwin, the method of biological research and explanation is driven by assuming purposiveness, which is firmly rejected in physics and hence biology has easily established its own independence from physics.
That's a very good summary. What's your take on the relationship between philosophy and psychology? The split seems a lot more recent there, and maybe not entirely decided even yet.
What makes an academic discipline â€“ beyond organizational necessities, i.e. that you need to belong to a certain department or faculty? Speaking very broadly, each discipline has.
