Worth noting that he immediately caved in the very next sentence, saying that this pretty much won’t change anything “unless US tests nuclear weapons first”. We know US won’t, so there’s that. Yet another empty threat designed to provoke a response.
Don't underestimate Russia's nuclear stockpile. While it is true that in every level of their army, there is so much corruption that hundreds of brand new state of the art supertanks turn into a dozen, russia relies heavily on their nuclear program to stop the west from interacting with their "special military operations". Their strategic rocket service is the one shining example of commitment and stewardship in russian service, because it has to be. Still there is nothing to worry about. Im not trying to spread fear in any way, but theres a reason the united states and russia have conducted inspections on each other's nuclear arms (which, sure, is now over). The russians will never use those bombs, but they will hold onto them and threaten us with them till the end of time.
Exactly. Without the US spending all this money it would create a power vacuum for our adversaries and if there's one thing that's certain it's that the US is the best outcome for world stability to be the 1 power. The US isn't perfect but it's a lot better than China and Russia having all the power.
