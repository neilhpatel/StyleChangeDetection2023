We got a one time consultation for free to explain our situation. They are on contingency, so I assume it's only cost effective if the "mental anguish/emotional distress" portion is worth more than the 1/3 that most of the injury lawyers in our area charge.
I assume the settlement covers our medical, vehicle and other miscellaneous costs. If the lawyer takes 1/3 of the recovered cost, we're effectively out 1/3 vs just trying to deal with it ourselves. We may recover less, but may be able to get more than 2/3 of what the lawyer settlement could get.
Sorry, I meant to say the lawyer takes 1/3, not the insurance. I assume the damages will be covered in full by USAA (regardless if we hire a lawyer or not). However, coverage for the medical bills is still an unknown since it might be difficult to prove that the contractions were caused by the accident. That leaves the mental anguish portion which we're unsure of the value.
Absolutely. But it will be much easier for an attorney to obtain it in a manner the insurance company will accept rather than you trying to do it on your own. The facts of this case (questionable cause of the not-exactly-an-injury and the refusal of medical attention at the scene) will make it trickier than something you should take on by yourself. An attorney will be able to get a much bigger settlement, negotiate with medical providers and handle all of the legwork. Theyâ€™ll be well worth their fee on this case.
