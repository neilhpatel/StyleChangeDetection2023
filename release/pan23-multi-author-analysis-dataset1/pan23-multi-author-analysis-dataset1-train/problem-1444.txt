This claim has been made by a multitude of contemporary sources, few of which seem to go into any significant depth beyond the nebulous "Nazi Germany sent agents to the United States before the Second World War to attempt to learn various Native American languages." I am curious about their sources. This effort by the Germans could have occurred, either as individual anthropologists or linguists, organized teams, or government consultation of enthralled German students who had chosen to study in the United States and then returned to Germany. There also, on the other side of the Atlantic, was fear of Nazi infiltration into United States institutions before and during World War II (stoked by the existence of the German-American Bund, the most prominent American pro-Nazi social organization of the mid to late 1930s), and the work of a few, albeit innocent, researchers or students could have been blown out of proportion by startled military intelligence officials.
Thank you for the great link! So it seems the answer is essentially "We don't know." Do you think that this question could be answered, or has it been too long now? Would there be records of this kind of thing in German archives somewhere, or was all of that destroyed/lost?
