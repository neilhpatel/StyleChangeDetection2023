> In this particular case, the comment "Hopefully not an [Object object]!" is a humorous way of saying that the object in question should not be mistakenly referred to as Object in this context. The follow-up comment "You need to use its toString() method, clearly they haven't thought of this" is making a joke about a common solution to this issue, which is to use the toString() method to explicitly convert the object to a string representation.
Electrical systems? That's a new one. Calling bs on that specific detail. edit: see thread below where I find I am wrong lol.
Probably. Assuming FTL isn't possible, you'd need a massive shield to prevent any tiny dust particule (or even atoms) to just shatter your ship while going at a reasonable amount of the speed of light.
And if FTL is possible, it would still probably require a shields missile proof to get in and out of it. Or not, but most likely.
A blimp would not be able to test a EMP, An EMP is a high altitude detonation of a nuclear device, or atleast an emp with the effect we are talking about, if you have plans to EMP someplace there's no real testing aside from testing the device itself i suppose, most of the "testing" is just going to be calculations or simulations on a computer most likely, id say a balloon like this is more gauging how good a countries Radar/detection systems are.
edit: if i remembered what the show's name was, i'd put it. I just stumbled on it booting up the tv one night. As u/IsawaAwasi said it could be an episode of Outer Limit but i'm honnestly not sure.
