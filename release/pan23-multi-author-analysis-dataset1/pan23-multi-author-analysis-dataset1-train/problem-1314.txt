Hi, thanks for your reply, I really appreciate it ) Do you really think it resembles the summerhouses you mentioned? I should have added, the window in the photo, that was the only window of the building, so you really can't observe any landscape from inside the building. Opposite it was just wall, and the other two sides had doorways, with no windows in it either. I suppose it could have been a place to take shade, or sit in the summer... although it's not in a particularly sunshine-blessed place (near North Wales!).
Summer houses are a relatively common addition to estates around England from the early 18th Century onwards, especially once the trend for artfully 'wild' landscape gardens replaces the previous taste for formal gardens which had endured since the Medieval period. Seen most emphatically in the work of Lancelot 'Capability' Brown, who designed over 170 estates around the country, 'landscape' gardens were controversial but fashionable and involved lots of landscaping and engineering to provide carefully crafted vistas designed to look as 'natural' as possible. Regimented flower beds, herb gardens and deer parks gave way to rolling vistas, ornamental lakes and artificially idyllic riverbanks, while planted forests and artificial hills hid 'unsightly' views like cities, or the homes of poor people. Indeed, the major medieval village of Milton Abbas in Dorset was largely demolished and rebuilt so as to hide it from the views from the newly-landscaped nearby estate.
