It is worth pointing out that there can be a tremendous difference between urban and rural: I interviewed an 18 year old in Dublin, Ireland in 1982 who asserted that when she was home in the country she believed in the fairies, but when she was in Dublin attending college, she did not. She was puzzled by this difference; we can expect that her sixteenth-century predecessors saw things in much the same way: the fairy faith have always been strongest away from concentrations of people. When it comes to ghosts, however, they persist quite nicely in urban environments. Indeed, ghosts thrives in places with lots of old buildings (and belief in them remains strong to this day), so we could not expect to find this rural-urban difference with regard to those entities.
Fascinating. Is this part of your work included in either of your published books? Do you have published the transcripts from your interviews? I would be delighted to read more about this!
There is good evidence of continued belief into recent times, and there are excellent examples of people asserting that belief was stronger in the past than it is "today" - and this evidence suggests that it has not been uncommon for people for several centuries to assert this. I address this in my recent book, (2018). Here is an excerpt:
Interesting. What could be the reason for this rural-urban divide between the belief in ghosts and faeries? What precluded for example a belief in urban and city elves and faeries?
