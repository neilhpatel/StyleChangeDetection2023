Once a player signs with a team, either via the amateur draft, or the international free agency system the team has a few years of "control" over them. While under team control, players salaries are basically set, and they are forced to play for that team. There is a salary arbitration period towards the end of team control where players can earn more based off their performance; but they can't just say "I don't want to play for the Yankees anymore" and test free agency. MLB League minimum for 2020 is $563,500 which gets paid out during the course of the regular season. During the minor leagues players make anywhere from $10-90K a year depending on the level and how much time they have in the system. Minor league guys are also only paid during the season and generally live in pretty crummy living situations during the season as $10,000 isn't really enough to live off of in America, especially with a lot of Latin players sending money back to their families.
So you got a lot of questions here, and I'll try to answer them all. I'll focus on hockey, which shares traits with the other three (MLB, NBA, NFL) sports in North America, while also being unique.
