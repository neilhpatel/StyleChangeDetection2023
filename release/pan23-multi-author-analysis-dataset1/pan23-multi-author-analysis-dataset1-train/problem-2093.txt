A former member of a notorious Russian paramilitary force has surrendered to Norwegian authorities, a rare defection that his lawyer and Russian human rights activists say could aid international investigations into Moscow’s atrocities in Ukraine.
Do apes taught you to read? Or are you just a troll ? I clearly said i was not okay but i guess you lack mental capacity to discuss and just push you point. And yet you still avoid answering the question, pathetic.
Andrei Medvedev, who says he commanded about 15 fighters in mercenary g in Ukraine, has applied for asylum in Norway after being detained by local security forces for illegally crossing the nation’s border with Russia in the early hours of Friday, his lawyer, Brynjulf Risnes, said.
Oh sure. So many war crimes will and have been exposed, what has the world done? Nothing other than strong words and some sanctions. Many close allies of Putin and their family are still enjoying their dirty billions of while living in the comfort of their multi-million dollar estates in the West and the US. It’s fucking laughable.
Norwegian immigration authorities confirmed that a man matching Mr. Medvedev’s description was detained and had requested asylum, but declined to comment further, citing security and privacy concerns.
Eh, I dunno. If someone can be convinced that their family in Ukraine is lying to them about the war, I'm sure they can be convinced that this individual was somehow bribed or mind-controlled by the Evil West™ prior to their "defecting".
