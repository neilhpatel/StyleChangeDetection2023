Post office employee here. Your carrier was wrong. She shouldn't be delivering mail to a vacant house. She should be returning the mail as "vacant" and that would notify the senders that nobody lives there. You have the right to remove the box, but then the carrier should be returning the mail as "no mail receptacle" and then the senders would not know that creepy dude doesn't live there. Since your carrier was incorrect with her advice about filing a change of address, you really need to go to your post office and speak with a supervisor. If you don't correct this situation before you sell the house, the new owners are going to inherit creepy dude.
Non-first class mail (marketing/junk, presorted STD, “or current resident”, EDDM/ECRWSS/ECRWSH, charity, political, non-profit).
What do you mean "push the topic"? Are you suggesting that the OP or someone in a similar situation should call the USPIS repeatedly trying to force them to investigate? Or call the US Atty office and push them to have federal LE investigate in order for them to prosecute? Because those will not work; they will only serve to waste everyone's time.
