As mentioned by /u/Rob-With-One-B, Schlieffen did not leave behind a strict plan with tight operating time tables. He left behind four rough ideas, which the Germans ended up using different pieces of two of them. And it still had room for flexibility. That the mobilization became so strict was more due to Moltke the Younger than anything.

I would like to expand on this a little here: Schlieffen introduced the concept of outflanking French fortresses by violating Belgian neutrality in 1905, but his memorandum was not structured like operations order and in fact envisioned using more corps than the Germany Army actually had at the time to encircle Paris. What is more, it is unlikely that the French road network could have actually supported so many troops. It's quite possible that Schlieffen's 1905 memorandum was actually an attempt to get increased military spending by presenting a "what-if" scenario, and his concept was subsequently adopted by the German General Staff to inform their mobilisation plans.
