Yeah, basically means if you surround yourself with people doing bad things, you shouldn't be surprised when bad things happen to you. It's not an insult about dogs.
If I remember correctly Chad purchased the jets, or at least the SU25s from Ukraine and I would imagine that package also included pilots and maintenance since I doubt thatâ€™s an area the Chadian military has a lot of specialists in.

This law isn't so much to protect service members, but rather specifically to protect George W. Bush and members of his administration (and later Obama and later Trump) from the ICC, as there was fairly widespread belief after multiple wars of profit in the early/mid 2000s that he or members of the administration would never be able to travel outside of the USA again for fear of being arrested and tried at the ICC. So this law was put on the books to allow members of the Executive to travel and be part of the global community without having to worry about facing consequences of their wars for profit. If we had a service member arrested for war crimes and tried at the ICC we'd certainly just leave them there.
