Every week I like to identify some of "The Real Questions" of /r/AskHistorians! Here, we honor the more atypical questions that get asked here: the bizarre, abnormal, strangely niche or oddly specific, interestingly worded or built on uncommon premises, or otherwise amusing questions that make me say, "Finally, someone is asking the real questions." We look at little-known customs, unexpected historical anecdotes, unusual cultural traits, and other more unique questions that go beyond the regular brand of sociopolitical history that this subreddit so fabulously covers.
And thus we come to the end of August, and one of the final digests of the summer. Buckle in because we’re in for a good time, with an amazing variety of answers on a breathtaking variety of topics. I talk it up, but only because I like to polish gold till it really shines!
If we're judging purely by question: I think Monty Python would win on the grounds of "reason for wondering" ("how much truth is there to this Monty Python joke" is always a fascinating topic), but Tolkien wins overall, on the grounds of actual subject matter—boiling it down to merely "historical antecedents to rap battling that someone like Tolkien would know about" vs "self-governing regions in feudal Europe"—by just a smidgeon.
That wraps us up for the week. Don’t forget to upvote and thank your favorite authors who put so much work into these posts!
