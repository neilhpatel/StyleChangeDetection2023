This guy is escalating. You are going to get evidence and have him trespassed a second time which can involve handcuffs and a car ride for your neighbor. After that, if he follows the pattern this will escalate again, and he could burn down your house, drive his car into it at full speed. who knows. What's important is that if he does do something that causes you to lose the use of your home you want to be covered. You have no idea if this guy is judgment proof, and he may not have much of a criminal record and be in that in-between world of normal and dementia so the judge may kick the trespassing case or give him a stern don't do it again which will probably be ignored.
NAL. Your neighbor is not getting the message of the formal trespass notice. On the contrary, he's escalating. You need to establish a paper trail with the law enforcement on this escalating pattern of behavior. Keeping all surveillance footage and reporting him to law enforcement every time you see him on your property is your best bet. If he ends up causing any serious damage to your property, all of this will come in handy.
