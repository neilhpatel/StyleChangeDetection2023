I highly encourage you to tell your psychiatrist if you trust them or find a therapist that specialises in or (NOT the same as pedophilia). As someone else has mentioned, what you're describing is not enough for a psychiatrist or therapist to make a mandated report. That would require a plan, intent, and identified target. These types of thoughts are more common than you may think and, as you're experiencing, they can be really disturbing and distressing to the people with these thoughts. Please don't kill yourself, there is help out there.
Your therapist is generally bound to confidentially. Where your therapist is not bound, and in fact legally obligated to report, is if they perceive that you are a danger to yourself or others. This requires a higher bar than you have described, though. Generally this would require a desire to harm, a plan, and an intent to carry it out. From what you have described, have a desire, but no plan or intent, which would not make this a situation that your therapist would report.
