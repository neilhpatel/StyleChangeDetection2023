I’d feel the need to sternly set boundaries with a neighbor who would brazenly trespass and steal while I’m away. First I’d file the police report, i would definitely want this in case the neighbor escalates. Let the police take her by surprise and interview her. I am not going on that person’s property to talk to her, it’s begging her to say you trespassed on her property or harassed her. I’d Collect a copy of police report. Because I’m a lawyer I’d send a cease and desist letter telling her to stop trespassing and taking my chattel property and ask her to return the plants and pots or a certain amount of money that is equivalent in X amount of days or I’ll be bringing her to small claims.
This is the right answer. You live next door to this person so you want to minimize confrontation. You could even say something like, "hey maybe you thought I was throwing those plants out, but I wasn't, can I have them back? And the other stuff too?".
(1) A person is guilty of burglary in the second degree if, with intent to commit a crime against a person or property therein, he or she enters or remains unlawfully in a building other than a vehicle or a dwelling.
You're right! My point, though, is that OP shouldn't worry about that. Criminal charges aren't their concern. They should go to the police and file a report-- the prosecutor will decide whether to file charges and, if they elect to do so, what to charge the neighbor with.
