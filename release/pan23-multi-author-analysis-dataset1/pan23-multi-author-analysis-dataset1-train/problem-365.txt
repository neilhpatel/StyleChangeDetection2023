In a nation level sense,your friend took a small punch.ukraine isnt dead,hasnt lost a 10th of its population,isnt unlivable.Their suffering ,but they wl recover.You don’t recover from nuclear war.Your lands are irradiated and only a few thousand remain alive.If we escalate then ukraine dies as well.
Ukraine is sad but it is currently a european doesn't even have any defensive pacts with any one has any obligation to care except for denouncing russia.The fact that that many neutral countries launched sanctions is already rare.IF it were an ally ,then we should defend ukraine.But ukraine never was an ally which is why we aren't mobilizing to start world war 3.
about time…. sheesh?!? somebody is actually talking sense finally… ukraine should have been targeting russian territory long ago. enough of this keep it inside ukraine, it’s time to go all out and hit russia too. good stuff latvia 👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽.
Russia can be relied to only periodically bully weaker countries instead of declaring all out war.Every one of the five un security council members can be relied on to not escalate and cause a nuclear war,because its an unspoken agreement that they are allowed to invade weaker countries as long as they don't do it too often.
