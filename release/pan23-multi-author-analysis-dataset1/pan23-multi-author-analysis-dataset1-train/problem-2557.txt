It is absolutely stunning that Brazil is the example of democracy and the rule of law now as the US keeps sliding further into authoritarianism and an illegitimate justice system. It’s not even close the comparison of the two democracies. One has wealth hoarded at the top by an unaccountable few and the other reacts swiftly when the rule of law is violated even by the powerful and well connected. First the Scandinavian countries copied the new deal and the capitalist-socialist policies from the 40s and 50s to become thriving democratic countries with social safety nets and happy people and then Brazil shows the world what the rule of law is suppose to look like. How utterly embarrassing and shameful to squander such things to benefit the 1%.
Bureaucracy. Too many hoops to jump through to get everyone all at once, too much paperwork nobody cares enough to fill out. Brazil can literally just shove people into trucks and send’em to a holding cell cause they don’t have time for “rules and regulations”.
