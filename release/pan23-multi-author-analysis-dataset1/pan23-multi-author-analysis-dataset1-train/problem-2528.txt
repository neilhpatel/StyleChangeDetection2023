To put it simply emergency contacts have no legal binding. A person can put ANYONE as an emergency contact. An emergency contact is NOT the same as a guardian, next of kin, durable power of attorney, or surrogate decision maker. Only one of those persons can legally make decisions and even those people can decline to be involved without legal recourse. Emergency contacts are informed of what happened and then will be used to help contact appropriate next of kin or decision makers.
Yuuuuup. Make use of the represented parties rule, the second you both have lawyers you can choose not to waive your rights under that rule and gain legal protection against contact from his family. I used the same tactic to get my ex-wife go away.
I’m unsure of whether your RO is active and a court may see it as very fact dependent, but there is a chance that the sister contacting you on behalf of her brother (against whom you may still have a RO in place) to complain about your refusal to assist with his medical care may in itself be considered violative of your restraining order or harassment.
5. Say nothing at all, not a SINGLE WORD, to anyone who is even remotely in contact with him or his family. Any and all contact about even the most trivial detail _must_ go via your legal counsel. There are no "wait, even []?" cases. Literally not a single word. No "how was your day", no answering emails, no "clarification on the case", _nothing_. A person who has threatened to sue you is not your friend and should not be spoken to, at all. Lawyer-to-lawyer talking only.
Just jumping in because I haven’t seen this anywhere on the thread yet... In some jurisdictions, if a third party contacts you on behalf of a defendant against whom an RO is issued, courts may view the communication as a violation of the RO or harassment.
4. If served, then retain a lawyer, but the case shouldn't be onerous (still, lawyer is always needed with this kind of thing).
