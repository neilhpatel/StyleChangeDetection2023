I just don't want the OP to walk away from this thread thinking that if she tries to move and her husband files for the "emergency hearing" that it would make her a criminal or cause her to lose custody, when all it would actually mean is that she would need to bring the kids back.
Would OP be worse off, legally, if she took the kids and the husband filed the emergency hearing and she brought the kids back, versus OP not leaving at all? (Ignoring any logistical issues that may or may not exist with OP leaving and then returning.) It seems to me that if she leaves, there's a possibility she would be able to stay in the new location, whereas if she sticks around she simply makes it much easier for her husband to keep her there in the future.
I don't know. I don't the particulars of OP's life. There may be a secondary option that she move out, but stay in the state, file for custody and have it transferred to the state she has more ties to. It sounds like neither parent has any real connection to georgia.
