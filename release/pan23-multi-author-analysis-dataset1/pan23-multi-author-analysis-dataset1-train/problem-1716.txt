Luckily, I don't have to. The abuse of conscripts and recruits in the Russian service is well documented, both during the current war and as an ongoing thing. Russia's anti-lgbt stance and toxic masculinity is just their twisted way of covering up their military reliance on raping young men and perpetuating cycles of abuse. You wonder how seasoned Russian soldiers became so disconnected from violence, cruel and disturbed, and absolutely dependent on the word "fg" for day to day communication? That is how. They're all victims of institutionalized man-on-man sexual violence.
Great. If you're being sent to die to the front, may as well take down some leadership while you're at it. Take those fucks with you.
That would be for an intentional murder with extremely aggravating circumstances, or multiple intentional murders, I believe. He is charged with just causing serious harm that led to the death of the victim, yet, I believe. Anyway, even appearing to be conspiring against the regime is likely to draw way harsher punishments than any drunken fight.
