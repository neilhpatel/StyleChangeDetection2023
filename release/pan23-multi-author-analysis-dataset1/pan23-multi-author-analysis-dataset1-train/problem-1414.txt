You can find plenty of examples of countries that are at each other throats offering help to each other when disasters happen. For most Redditors the closest example is how Cuba and US always offer help to each other when natural disasters happen, though the other side almost never accepts (the only exception I know is Cuba accepting US aid after Hurricane Ian).
How I bring the US to this? They fought the Syrian Army and regime during the civil war through their proxies (lookup for CIA and DoD funded and trained groups in Syria). The US occupies parts of the country, steals its oil, and mostly importantly to this topic, imposes some of the most vile and crippling sanctions agains Syria. The victims of these sanctions are the Syrian people - same people you pretend to worry about their plight.
Blaming Assad for all Syria's calamities is such load of western propaganda. The country has gone through a 10-years long civil war. The Syrian Army was fighting ISIS and AQ offshoots all over Syria (groups the US media was telling you it's moderate, when they are just.. AQ head choppers).
Syria is totalitarian. Since 2011 Assad killed more than 1 million people, badly injured 4 million, and gained \15 million refugees half of them inside Syria. There is only one party, the Ba'ath party of the Alawites and the military elite that holds it together, with the help of the Sunni elite. This is a government that has always taken care of its oligarchy and oppressed the weak majority.
