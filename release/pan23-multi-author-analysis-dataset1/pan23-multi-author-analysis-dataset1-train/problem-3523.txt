That decision is like a soap opera. Aparently the UAF was warned because it planned to oust its current president (who is being charged with embezzelment of football funds and corruption) and replace him with Schevchenko who apparently has close ties to Putin through Abramovich. So the charge by FIFA is that there are outside forces pushing this (a Russian plot against the UAF). So why move forward with a tournament in Russia if they are afraid of Russia taking over UAF? The logic doesnâ€™t register.
There has been public fronts against FIFA from the German FA, Netherlands FA and a few more over Qatar and the way it is run, since this tournament is under 16 it won't get as much attention but if they were to do something similiar with the senior internationals I could definitely see something happening, most of the North American and South American countries would soon follow as well.
Are you kidding? Rents in Tbilisi are through the roof. There are plenty of Georgians worried about Putin declaring Georgia a Russian state similar to Crimea and Donbas due to the quantity of Russians residing in Georgia.
Seriously? They honestly expect that anybody will send a bunch of kids to a country at war? That teenagers will be safe in a place that sent a western sportsperson to gulag over minuscule traces of a drug? Did they check flight connections from EU to Russia?
