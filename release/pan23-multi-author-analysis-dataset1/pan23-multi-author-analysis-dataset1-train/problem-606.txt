I am not OPs attorney, I were I would take the time to find more relevant case law and admittedly I definitely cited employment cases that more recently relevant to me. However, my intention for citing these cases is to emphasize that NLRB as it relates to distinctions of concerted activity and collective bargaining is heavily weighted in favor of employees, especially when given to an attorney who isnâ€™t quick to take on cases that require novel arguments.
If the courts determine that discussions made with OPs employer can be considered collective bargaining and that the no call no show was in direct response to failure to meet the demands, this could be considered under the NRLA as a protected concerted activity. Difference in outcome is entirely dependent on attorney advocacy and judicial discretion.
Haney v Aramark is a weird thing to cite. Here the employer tried to claim federal preemption because the employee's action could constitute organized action. Aramark was in the process of collective bargaining with the Teamsters (so there was a union involved). The employee did not claim to be engaged in organized behavior.
