In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
No at all. Anything is justified so long as it's LEGAL. And the people of America decides what is legal or not. If tomorrow we repelled the 19th Amendment (the one that let women to vote), then any American that believes in Democracy and Rule of Law, will stop women from voting. If you do not do so, then you are unAmerican.

Gerrymandering is by definition not democratic. This isn’t a “No true Scotsman” because I’m not redefining anything. The will of the people is a democracy by definition. You’ve forgotten we’re in a republic. While they won by the rules and i don’t have a problem with that, they’re forcing an agenda in the people with no popular support. And they’re doing it for religious reasons that are complete nonsense. God supports abortions in numbers 5. This is just another Salem Witch Trials in our history, clearly undemocratic, superstitious and bad public policy meant only to mask the tax cuts for their rich patrons and to subjugate women in defiance of God’s natural law who gave them dominion.
Depends on who does the appointment. We don't elect the Attorney General of the United States, but that position has legitimacy, because the Attorney General was confirmed into office by our elected representatives.
