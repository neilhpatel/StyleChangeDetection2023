This has all happened in Tennessee. I was able to change the deed to my name with shelby county by submitting a notarized document basically saying I am only living relative, maybe I am not using the right term. I was not able to change the mortgage to my name with Bank of America. They needed a will, which she did not have. They told me I could simply pay the monthly mortgage and "hope" they let me become owner of the home once it is paid for.
I simply chose to not do anything and let the home foreclose. I hadn't looked into it since then, 2019, and received a letter from Rubin Lublin law firm recently about surplus funds. I honestly have no interest in the funds because I do not want to be responsible for completing debt payments. I have no idea who all she owes and no time to find out. I don't even live in Tennessee anymore.
It is also possible that one of her creditors (companies that she owes money to) might file themselves to open up probate of her estate so that they can get paid some or all of what they are owed, if they find out that the excess proceeds exist.
I would be as well. You were not authorized to administer the estate (presumably) and even if you were, the debts have to be paid. I'd talk to a lawyer before anything else. Her creditors might still be able to come after you personally for putting the house into your name instead of selling it and paying her debts and taxes. You cannot inherit debt, but if you administer improperly, you can be personally liable.
