The goal of something like laws against carrying isn't really about just having a gun someplace but the idea that banning the gun would prevent misused in that location. The misuse or things that actually cause harm are still a crime. Seeing as the point is prevention the issue of the law not actually preventing harm due to criminal misuse seems relevant. If someone walks by you with a concealed firearm what's the damage to society?
So again what is the actual harm in someone just concealed carrying? If you live or visit a state that has carry you likely walk by armed people all time and never knew it.
You didn't, actually. You talked about real vs. perceived harm, which has nothing to do with the fact that _murder laws don't stop murderers_ and _theft laws don't stop thieves_. The statement in question here is whether or not laws work, not whether or not violating the law causes real or perceived harm. Would you like to try again?
Reminder that 2A was expressly drafted to prevent the federal government from disarming the states at a time when the founders, fresh from defeating a tyrant, were fearful that unarmed states would be prone to invasion by neighboring nations or an authoritarian federal government. That's why the "well regulated militia" language is there.
