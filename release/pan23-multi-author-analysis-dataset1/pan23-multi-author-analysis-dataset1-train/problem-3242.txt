Fees are not the same as deposits. Fees are for the landlord. So the $300 fee went to the landlord's operation. They can ask for a fee every year. This isn't uncommon for places that have certain amenities. Where I live near DC, a lot of apartments will have fees for parking, the gym, the pool, the common rooms,... They are usually not individually listed. But the fee is for those things. But those fees are part of each annual lease and can change.
