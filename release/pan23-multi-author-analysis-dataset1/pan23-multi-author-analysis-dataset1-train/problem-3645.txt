One of the things I’ve been hearing from media interviews of Russian pow’s is that many of them do not know what or why they are doing it. On top of that they are going along with it because of a feeling of “what choice do I have? This is my lot in life.” They are indoctrinated into a cog in the wheel mentality. It’s frustrating and sad.
KYIV, Nov 23 (Reuters) - There is evidence that Russian commanders in several instances were aware of sexual violence by military personnel in Ukraine “and in some cases, encouraging it or even ordering it,” according to an international criminal lawyer assisting Kyiv’s war crimes investigations.
Yep. I'm also pretty sure that "ceasefire" in this case just means "time to freely maneuver Wagner+conscripts into a position to attack Ukrainian forces immediately after the ceasefire.".
The previously unreported findings by investigators about the alleged role of commanders and the systematic nature of attacks in some locations are part of patterns of alleged sexual violence that are emerging as Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its ninth month.
