I'm pretty sure French commentary on what is considered 'good' and 'bad' influence in many parts of West Africa is met with a mixture of indifference, mockery and distrust.
Exactly. I hate it when the European colonial past or slave trade is brought up. It is important to know history and learn from it, the bad and the good. But..
another dishonest article. yes, they are not paying directly for french forces deployed in the country but they are paying a made up debt in a currency controlled by france.
Hahahahahahahaha. France is complaining about a country having a predatory influence in Africa? What a joke.
Like I said, it's VERY good to know the history, know how bad things were (regarding many things, not just colonization), learn from it, be aware that it is an extra important topic for the descendants of the victims, but also realize you are not to blame. If you find that disgusting I would like to hear more. Should I as a European born in the early 90s be crippled by guilt my entire life for what my country did centruies ago? And my children too?
it is just typical communication dishonesty where they answer questions with "details" (paying for french military) to refute the general point (paying any sum to france in the billions).
And where does this slippery slope end? Europeans were incredibly cruel to each other for 2+ millenia, certain countries completely ceased to exist multiple times, many genocides.. Ukraine alone has suffered 4 genocides at the hand of Russia in the past 3 centuries. Should France demand reparations from Italy for what the Roman Empire did? Should middle eastern nations demand reparations from Turkey for what the Ottomans did?
