I have a somewhat older answer here, which I can't link because I can't find the old thread, dealing only with the rise of Fascism in Italy, and even that, from a rather specific angle. Since you correctly point out that Fascism appeared in the early 1920s and came to power in Italy almost a decade before the effects of the great financial crisis were felt there, I suppose the following – far from covering every one of your points – may help at least with this side of the answer.
> The inflation was the main fact, which dominated the social and political history, and therefore also the economical one of the two years [1919-20] and of the two subsequent ones […] before the rise of Fascism. The main fact, not because I intend to argue that the devaluation of the Lira is the ultimate and true reason of everything which happened in Italy after the end of the war, but because it can be taken as a symbol or a synthesis of the many reasons suggested to explain the later events; and also, and perhaps with better reason, because symbols and in particular the evil ones, have by themselves a virtue to generate further effects, likely to become equally or more damaging than those which could be ascribed to the original causes summarized within the symbol.
Thank you for your (very) comprehensive answer! I think it will take me more then one read to cover.
And the Italian financial situation after the war was indeed troubling, if not necessarily dramatic, with the additional problems created by the unruly forms of development experienced by certain industrial sectors which had largely benefited from the increase in war expenditure, the related financial bloating and their efforts to leverage on their political weight to stabilize during the movement from war-economy to peace-economy. This state of things led to series of crisis of "financial adjustment", most famous probably those involving two major steelworks and shipbuilding companies – the Ansaldo and ILVA, with their background of credit and financial institutes – during the early 1920s.
