The industrialization also did not lead to a marked improvement in the average Soviet citizen's life. The long term effects were not felt by those who were the ones working, instead it would take years for the fruits of their labor to be felt. The first Five Year Plan focused mainly on Heavy Industry which allowed, for example, more tractors which ultimately led to more food production by less people, yet it would take years for the effects to be felt. A shortage of consumer goods would also plague the Soviet Union during this period where shortages were common. The industrialization was good for the Soviet Union, but perhaps not good for the individual during that period. The long term benefits, however, cannot be understated either. The Heavy Industry drive did allow the Soviet Union to increase its focus on its military which led to an increase in tanks and weapons being built, which would allow it to protect itself against threats that were very real and would strike by the end of the decade.
