What should’ve happened is that they should’ve sent you a window sticker so you could see all the features and sticker price. They should’ve had a general idea of what your trade was before you got there, and how much you were willing to finance. What sounds like what happened is they didn’t have the ad car on the lot, or maybe it was so different than what you responded to, like a different color or trim that you indicated, that they tried to get something similar are work the deal from there, or more realistically that car could’ve sold before you got there. Regardless a good sales person would’ve been able to set the expectation better, but it still happens that at the end of the day, the expectation was already set from the inbound sale center.
My best guess is that they yes’d you to get into the dealership to work a deal - I had our inbound call center do this all the time and all it does is set the salesperson up for failure, and you end up with an infuriated customer.
4. I asked if I could come in and buy it for $37k, since they claimed the Autotrader price of $34k was not a price they could honor, and they said yes.
On the phone a week ago I was told the price of the car was $34k. I asked if that was before tax, title, and fees, and if that was the price I would finance. I was told yes.
In short, theoretically the manufacturer has vehicles on the ground somewhere that will hit those numbers advertised. That dealership may have that build, and if it does they typically will only have one or two built that way to hit that specific number. Usually they don’t have too many of these “bone” vehicles on the lot because they are designed to lure customers in, but don’t have a lot of the features that people like.
