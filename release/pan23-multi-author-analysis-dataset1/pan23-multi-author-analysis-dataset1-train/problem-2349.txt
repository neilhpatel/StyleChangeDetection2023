Does your lease guarantee a parking spot, or does it just state you may use the lot, but not promise reserved parking?
Your complex isn't violating your lease unless you are unable to park and were guaranteed parking in the lease. They might not be enforcing lease terms against other residents, but you don't know if their lease allows for unroadworthy vehicles. Your lease is an entirely separate contract than your neighbors' leases, and then not enforcing theirs isn't a violation of yours, until you do not have access to something explicitly granted or violation of tenancy law (this isn't.).
Otherwise, even in a situation where everyone signs the same lease, the landlord can selectively enforce the lease -- as long as they don't discriminate based on protected classifications.
Sorry, yes. The lease specifically states that cars can't be stored here. They must be in use. But there are project cars, broken down cars, cars that very obviously have not moved in weeks (some even years). There aren't enough parking spaces, reserved or otherwise, for everyone living here. I have called the office with license plates and a receptionist called us yesterday to tell us that cars can be stored here as long as the residents wants. It sounds to me like they don't want to do their job.
