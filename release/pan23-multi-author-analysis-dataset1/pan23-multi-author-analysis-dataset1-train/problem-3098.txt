If you log into reportaproblem dot Apple dot com and request a refund, one of the refund reasons they offer you is "a child made purchases without my permission". If you didn't do that, you should.
So you're kind of out 1500 bucks and I don't see any particular way for you to get out of paying the 1500 bucks other than throwing yourself on the mercy of one of the companies, or of getting a local news program to pick your case up as a human interest thing and basically make it a publicity problem for Apple.
All the beating around the bush is just making this less clear. All in-app digital purchases on iOS have to go through Apple, so that is where you need to request your refund. Where and how did you do that?
And indeed at the following link below you will find apple's legal statement regarding the fact that you needed to put child controls on your child's account even when he was using your iPad; as you are required to put those controls on each individual device. It's even bolded in their agreement (presuming of course this is the agreement you're bound under which I cannot say for certain).
