In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Not how it works. If people vote 'present' or are physically not present to vote (remember some elections may not be decided yet) it does not count toward the total. That is why Pelosi was elected with 216 votes in 2021 (with 3 Democrats voting Present and 3 Representatives who were absen).
Pelosi had 3 presents and 3 absences in the voting scheme - meaning she only required 215 votes to clinch. Republicans (if they get to 219) can only have two absences or present or no vote and can clinch the Speakership. Everyone else has to be in the seat and voting. Cause if there are 216 democrats I guarantee you they will all be there and voting for 1 candidate.

Previous Republican Speakers have described the House Freedom Caucus as "legislative terrorists" and political cannibals. We're looking at government shutdowns every time a funding bill comes through or McCarthy crawling to Pelosi and begging for the votes to put bills over the top.
