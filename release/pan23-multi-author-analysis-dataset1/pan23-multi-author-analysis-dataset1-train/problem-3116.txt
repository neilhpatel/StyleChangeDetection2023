The problem is that in too many places single family housing is the only type that can be built, there are zoning laws preventing the building of high capacity housing, there are NIMBYs who complain about the skyline and bemoan the demolition of historic parking lots, there are ordinances all over saying what can be built where and for what purposes, and the result is that the demand for housing is significantly outstripping the supply.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
