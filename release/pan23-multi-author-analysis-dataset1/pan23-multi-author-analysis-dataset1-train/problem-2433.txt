the articles I read said 90 agreed, with an option on 30 for to make 120. They've been rolling off the upgrade line in Czechia every four days and are then shipped directly to Ukraine from there.
Edit: for clarity, sadly this problem was bipartisan - Democrats wanted to cut defense spending and focus on "the right wars" and increased social programs, Republicans wanted to cut spending entirely but allocate defense manufacturing dollars to only their states (and look "strong on defense" while actually gutting real-world capabilities).
Lol have you? Do you? Forgive my bluntness, but you don't seem to have a fucking clue, given your claims earlier that "99% of Sahrawi consider themselves Moroccan" and that Sahrawi people in Laayoune are "under no oppression", when I just showed you video of Sahrawi in Western Sahara, including Laayoune itself, literally celebrating Morocco's defeat and getting brutalized for it.
its kind of an easy sell though. What would you rather have? Upgraded knock-off soviet tanks that are still largely untested in battle OR a slightly older us tank that is proven in battle and has been refined over the last 20 years as it has seen extensive use in theater?
No true Sahrawi, right? I strongly suggest you pull your head out of the sand and recognize the deep antipathy towards their colonizers (rightfully) held by the actual people who've inhabited the region for centuries, and not just since 1975.
