The only thing Ron has done for Florida since becoming governor over four years ago is run for President. Everything is performative so as to be in the headlines.
Turns out that just doing away with Disney’s Reedy Creek Improvement District – which put the company in control of the sprawling area it inhabits – would force taxpayers in surrounding counties to shoulder the costs of running the Disney-occupied area (think emergency services, road repairs etc.) and take on the special tax district’s roughly $1 billion in debt.
I am all for the chaos of them fighting each other, but strategically he would be much better off going full ted cruz, kissing the ring and then being shit on in 2028 when Trump somehow is still around and decided he wanted to support some other random despite your loyalty last round.
Yes. Mentioned as a plan last year, that the Florida legislature changed to fix Ron’s mistake, where they renamed the district rather than dissolve it.
It was mentioned in the article, but appears to be describing a plan to get rid of the district (which would have moved the debt to the rest of Floridians) that was scrapped, in favor of just renaming the district, thanks to a special session where the Florida legislature had to clean up Ron’s mess.
