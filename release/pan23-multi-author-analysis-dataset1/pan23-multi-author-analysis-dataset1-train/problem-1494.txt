Where I come from we just call them ass holes, I save boomers for the aforementioned baby boomers. My grandma was a baby boomer, heavily biased for liberal rights until the day she died. She advocated for many women and ethnic rights actively(except for anyone with Arabic descent, she was super racist against them. I called her out on it multiple times, even went so far as to introduce a friend of mine who was an immigrant to the US). She died September right before Trump was elected. Her second to last words were “I can’t die yet I have to see the first female president” Miss that old woman but I’m happy she didn’t get to see this mess.

Conservatives absolutely did which is why suddenly dropping it after reports recently of them being confident the investigation was coming to a close definitely leads to it being a conservative justice leaking. If Kagan or Sotomayor leaked it, they'd be screaming about it through every megaphone they could find.
