I wish I could provide a more definitive answer to when the first such flag was displayed at the capital. As a point of law, no flag other than the United States Flag is to be flown at the Capitol building, so no rebel flag has ever been flown at the Capitol, but it is possible that a captured rebel flag may have been displayed as early as the American Civil War (the dome was under construction from 1855 to 1866), or at any time thereafter, and there have certainly been variations on the Confederate flag on display, in the form of various state flags like that of Mississippi that incorporate elements from the Confederate flags, or unit patches from military units that do the same, etc. etc. in the early 20th century.
No it was a version of the 1st Confederate National Flag so far as I have seen, the Army of Northern Virginia, or more properly its antecedent, Confederate Army of the Potomac had been formed in April to command the Virginia units and later reinforcements sent to Northern Virginia.
