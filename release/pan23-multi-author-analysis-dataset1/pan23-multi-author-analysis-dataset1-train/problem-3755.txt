Exactly. If elections arent close they dont have to wait for military ballots or curing provisional ballots. AZ is not the only slow one. And all states need to allow pre election day counting of mail in ballots. It is Republican legislatures that oppose this. And Republicans who scream about delayed results. Catch 22.
