No it’s not. Student loan relief was, and he hasn’t talked about it in months. That’s not exactly showing conviction or fighting for it. I don’t care what other stuff he fixes if he doesn’t follow through on loan forgiveness. Because progressives kind of forced him, he used it as a campaign promise. Because of that and the way Republicans work they decided to try to accomplish the exact opposite and make sure no one ever gets any relief and loan borrowers are trapped forever by a decision made when they were still in high school. Idgaf that it’s stuck in courts - this is when he should really be relentlessly hammering away at Republicans for sabotaging us when they themselves got PPP loans forgiven, almost always for much more than $10K. Democrats are fucking terrible at allowing the opposition to control the narrative and set the tone of national discourse on everything.
Yeah. 34 here with an initial $12k for my CS degree. Balance slowly went up while I made the <$50 payments I could afford at my early minimum wage agency web dev jobs. By the time I started making "real" money beyond covering rent and utilities and such, it had already grew to about 59k after two interest recapitalizations and associated fees. Now with the rent increases over the time since the pause started, there's no way I could possibly cover what my minimum payments used to be.
