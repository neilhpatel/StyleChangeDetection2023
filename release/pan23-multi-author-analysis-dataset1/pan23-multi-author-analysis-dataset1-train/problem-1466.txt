OK, define Doomsday? Is it a single day where the earth explodes? Cause I don't think the war in Ukraine is going to cause that. Nuclear War? There is no guarantee that it would be an all out exchange, and then, no guarantee it would be the end of the human race. Not exactly doomsday. Sucky day, sure.
There was also a new study article published about elephant extinction - decrease of 60% in some over the last 10 years, around 450,000 left in the world, 40k in Congo, which could reduce rainforest carbon capacity by 6-9% (which would be accumulative on top of deforestation).
This is bullshit. We should have been at doomsday already. 10 seconds with ukraine war? Weak Covid pandemic should have brought us to 20 seconds to doomsday. Bullshit.
Pandemics are becoming a more frequent threat as humans encroach on natural areas, wildlife migrate and mingle more in new areas with new species and close to humans, and domestic factory farming fails to address its sanitation and over medication issues.
