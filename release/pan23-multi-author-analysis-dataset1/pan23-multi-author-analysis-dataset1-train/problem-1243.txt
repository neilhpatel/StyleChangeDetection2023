You're likely thinking of the law that prohibits certain behavior by debt collectors, but the FDCPA doesn't apply to original creditors, and there is no law in Louisiana that prevents anyone from telling the entire world that you owe a debt.
Thank so much! I really appreciate this. I definitley have context of her day before calling us at office and screaming at us for 45 mins nonstop about her issue with us. Next day my rent is late so she texts the office? That seems like it could be presented as calculated. Would the standard of she should’ve known better apply?
-OP, definitely start documenting everything. I would make it a point to send a professional and kind written email requesting she cease contact with your place of work. If she continues, or retaliates that is in definition harassment. As well as randomly making the rent due after your job upset her. Then you have a paper trail of her garbage. I've had to do this before. She very clearly has personal issues with you. And unfortunately shes being microagressive so its hard to call her on. Hate people like that.
Another question. She hasn’t provided me with a copy of lease signed by her. I have the one I signed and sent to her but she never sent me one back and she was supposed to. I haven’t said anything about this since things have been fine. I know in LA you can have an oral lease but if the intent is to have a written one does that change?
