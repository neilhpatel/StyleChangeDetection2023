I hate seeing this take on here. Everybody likes to say the GOP is stupid or woefully incompetent, but they successfully stacked the Supreme Court and rolled back Roe v Wade. They got the least electable person I’ve ever seen in my life elected to president and seem poised to take back human rights a couple more decades. They’re about to stack the legislatures on their sides for decades and if the democrats play by their rules then guess what: that stacked Supreme Court will determine it to be narrowly unconstitutional for the democratic states.
Not quite yet. They still have to at least go through the motions, though I'll agree that's all they are doing, but it is not every single state yet. After this legislation passes the court, it is going to be a free for all where every state does a mad rush to get their dominant party setup forever.

This could backfire, spectacularly. What happens if blue states(looking at you CA) decide to ditch their nonpartisan maps? Goodbye US house for the GOP...
