You could quit later, it has to be paid out one way or the other. If you request PTO after it goes into affect they will subtract it from your accrued hours. If you still have any left and you quit or or fired, they owe it to you.
is reasonably straightforward. It does prohibit forfeiture of accrued vacation time at any point, so it would not be permissible for your employer to simply wipe everyone's current accrual balances when switching to unlimited PTO without paying those employees for that accrued time. However, it would be permissible for your employer to require you to use that accrued PTO first before taking any unaccrued paid time off under their new "unlimited" plan. They could also require all employees to use up their accrued balances by actually taking time off at a time of the employer's choosing. They can also elect to simply pay employees for their current accrual balances at the end of this year and clear them off that way. Any of those options would be permissible under CA law.
