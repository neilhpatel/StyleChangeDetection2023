The entire death toll was due to governmental corruption allowing for building code to not be enforced so what makes you think all that money is going to go the ppl. I’m guessing only 1-10% will land indirectly to victims while the rest get pocketed by politicians and their friends.
Personally? I would never burn a religious book. I’m catholic myself. But if somebody wants to burn a Bible, that’s between them and God. I wouldn’t like that person, same as you wouldn’t like somebody who burns a Quran. However: I don’t get to dictate the freedoms of others because of my religious convictions. That’s not how the west operates, sorry. If you would like to live in a country where religion trumps civil liberties, feel free to move to Egypt or Iran or Saudi Arabia or the UAE etc. But don’t try and blackmail the West into appeasing your delicate religious sensitivities.
Separate incident. The US government detected two Chinese spy balloons. Which were legitimate spying craft.
It's also important for the long term evolution of political development that the developed democracies of the world show that they are willing to help people experiencing natural disasters regardless of their relationships with the governments of the impacted areas.
No. Just because a religious fundie gets pissed off doesn’t mean everybody loses their freedom and civil liberties. The west shouldn’t get blackmailed because some people are sensitive.
