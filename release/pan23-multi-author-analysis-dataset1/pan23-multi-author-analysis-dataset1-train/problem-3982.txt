i want to comment, somewhat anecdotally, here that independently of it’s historical accuracy, Lapid’s attitude and outlook on this topic is one widely shared by many Israelis and a even a goodly percentage of Jews elsewhere in the world — there’s a widespread perception that the Holocaust in Poland was as deadly as it was precisely because it aligned with the preexisting prejudices and bigotries of the Christian Polish population.
I’m not sure how falsifiable this view is, but the Kielce pogrom and similar events, as well as the widespread opposition to displaced persons being able to reclaim their real property from before the war, are often cited as evidence of polish enthusiasm and complicity to the destruction of European Jewish persons.
Thanks. I saw those posts, they touch the broader subject of Polish attitudes and actions during the Holocaust. In this case I'm more interested in the specific Lapid's claim. I'm curious if there's some hard historical evidence supporting it or whether it was more of his personal hypothesis stated like a fact.
