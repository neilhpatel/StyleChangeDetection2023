In some hypothetical completely-decentralized model, where a piece of software ultimately serves to facilitate a direct transaction between a passenger and a driver, the driver would likely be responsible for complying with any relevant laws. You'd need to keep entirely out of that business - you can't operate any services for the drivers or passengers, for example - and even then you could expect regulators to at least look into your operation to confirm your non-involvement. Managing and sharing costs of those obligations would be a good reason for drivers to organize, though, and that would - pretty organically - give rise to either a co-op or another taxi company, that happens to use your app in its line of business initially.
