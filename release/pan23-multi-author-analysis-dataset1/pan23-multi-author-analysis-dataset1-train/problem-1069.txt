I agree with you on Alex Jones. That guy is a nut that pushed blatant lies and conspiracy theories. The others you mentioned are basically just reporting the same news as everyone else, just worded in a way that appeals to the people on the right. There is a huge difference in saying Sandy Hook was a hoax and women aren't men and vice-versa. If there is a single credible quote where any of those mentioned specifically said that trans people should be killed, please provide the link.

Additionally, authoritarians like having “enemies” to distract the weak-minded. Could be black people, women, young voters, Latinos, LGBTQ. Could be school boards (see Pompeo’s recent foot-swallow).
Seriously? Damn, I should be JACKED! What am I doing wrong? I'm a firearms instructor and I have to work my ass off in the gym to stay in shape. What guns should I buy to get this steroid effect you speak of?
