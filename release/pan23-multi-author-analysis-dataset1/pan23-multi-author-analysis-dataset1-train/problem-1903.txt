But she refuses to do it and i know she needs it you cant really fully understand my situation but i have to do it if not she could die and she cant stop working because without it we have no money if i get a job they will cut my benefits and i wont be able to pay for my medications which cost $50,000 a month and i have no experience or degree she needs this job but she doesn't need to die for it she got home and she is already in bed for the night and its only 6PM she hasn't eaten yet either.
You simply cannot do it for her. She must act on her own behalf. You cannot approach her employer for accommodations, only she can. If you submit a complaint on her behalf, especially without her knowledge, it's likely to cause her trouble at work. She could be fired, even if she had no knowledge of you doing it. It would also be incredibly difficult for you to submit an accurate complaint as workers can waive their lunch breaks. If she's agreed to waive her meal break, it's not a violation if she does not take one.
