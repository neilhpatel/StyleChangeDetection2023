It is not totally clear from this if you are even covered by the FHA but even assuming you are, and assuming that he is illegally refusing to renew your lease due to a legitimate ESA you cannot get out of paying last month's rent;.
I just want to say thank you all for your advice. I realize that I’m no legal expert, and I also realize that I don’t know sh!t about the law. As I’ve said, my job (a government agency) has lawyers who can provide free basic legal advice, and one of these lawyers both advised that I pay my rent, on time (which I did) and also advised that, If I so desired, I allow him to review all documentation and subsequently “shame” the primary tenant into allowing me to staying where I’m at, since a new lease/sublease would include first & last months rent as well as a deposit. The attorney suggested going to court, and presenting the fact that I’m a “disabled service member” who is actively serving, although I hate to characterize my self this way because it takes so much from those service members with actual injuries and disorders. The attorney also suggested that I talk to the primary tenant (who happens to be my ex boyfriend from years ago) and seek clarity on the situation.
UPDATE AND CONCLUSION: (Tl/dr: Lawyer from work advised I pay rent and talk to primary tenant who is going onto a month to month lease and needs to end my lease due to unstable life and family situation).
