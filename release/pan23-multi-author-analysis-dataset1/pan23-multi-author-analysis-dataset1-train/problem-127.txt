It also does a lot to help reduce the prison population in Russia if they are all fed into a unsurvivable combat zone as literal suicide squads. That was probably part of the motivation. Instead of keeping these prisoners in prison, send them out to fight, best case scenario (for Russia) they take out some Ukrainian forces and help remove some Ammo and soldiers from the Ukrainian army. Worst case scenario they get killed and you have less prisoners to feed and house. I wouldn’t put it past Putin and company to not care about the outcome of these soldiers.
Russian propaganda movies are actually surprisingly decent. I highly recommend watching T-34. It’s extremely campy (in one scene, an escaped red army soldier suggests stealing food from German civilians, but is shot down because “the red army doesn’t pillage”), but the special effects are very cool. Bullet time tank rounds and stuff. Very flashy and worth watching.
Apparently there is an entire subgenre of Russian science-fiction alternate history propaganda books and films that is basically just "Current Russians with modern weapons and equipment are mysteriously time-traveled back to a pivotal point in Russian history to alter the balance of power in Russia's favor.
