Same. I’m in Ohio. We are really considering moving to a bluer state, even if it’s just Michigan. Eventually it’ll all get overrun by GOP so we are making a 10 year plan to get the fuck out completely because I have a daughter that needs to be able to make decisions about her own body. It starts with abortion and it’s just going to snowball from there.

I am incredibly disappointed and beyond frustrated. I'm a woman in a red state rapidly losing my human rights and they just handed them even more to use to gain more power. I'm pissed.
Only because trump and his supporters cant understand nuance and think missing some documents after leaving office is the same as intentionally stealing thousands of, many above top secret, documents and then intentionally withholding them and lying to investigators until ultimately your house has to be raided by the FBI because you won’t comply.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
One intentionally stole hundreds of documents, many that literally aren’t supposed to leave the room they’re in, concealed them, refused to give them back, pretended to give them all back, and then had to have his home raided to get them all back (but there’s still some missing).
