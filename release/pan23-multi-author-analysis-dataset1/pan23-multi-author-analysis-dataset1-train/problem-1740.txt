This is incorrect. NATO generally keeps fairly low stocks of artillery munitions because our doctrine is almost entirely dependent on air dominance, the idea being that you don't need tons of standard artillery if you control the air and can use aerial bombardment at will, and generally that's worked pretty well, NATO nations have the largest and most advanced air forces in the world, and every engagement they've been involved with it's been entirely trivial to gain air superiority, even in a theoretical conflict with Russia or China, it's predicted that NATO forces would be able to still be able to relatively easily maintain air superiority. The war in Ukraine however negates that strategy, neither side has been able gain effective air supremacy, though the Russians have a very clear edge in that regard, so old fashioned artillery duals are the mainstay of strategic and tactical bombardment there, and air supremacy isn't necessary for Russian doctrine any way, which is dependent on conventional artillery based advances, which is based on the old Soviet playbook and therefor is also the basis for Ukrainian military strategy as well. Russia has the largest, as far as I'm aware, stockpile of 'dumb' artillery munitions in the word and one of the largest stockpiles of guns to fire those munitions, an inherited legacy from the Soviet Unions massive military production capabilities, on a strictly numbers basis, Russia has always outgunned NATO in an artillery capacity, it's just never been considered relevant by NATO planners since the enemies artillery advantage is negated if you can blow up his guns and ammo stocks from the sky. China's a bit more iffy since their numbers are a lot harder to get, but given that, until the last few decades China had similar doctrine to the USSR, it's reasonable to assume they also maintain a huge stock of conventional artillery and munitions, that would outclass NATO's.
Oh? You have solid evidence that the sanctions are ineffective? I think you'll surprise a lot of government officials with that.
