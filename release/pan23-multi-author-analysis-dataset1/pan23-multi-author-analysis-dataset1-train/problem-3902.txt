Also, no he has no house. He was renting but now hopping around with his girlfriend. He has a brand new truck since all this started. He had a truck in his ex mother in laws name, but he racked up payments on it, then he took money he was evidently getting from the estate. Financed a new truck, and left the past due truck in his mother in laws driveway. So that's what we are dealing with. Unfortunately, everyone was acting off of emotions when they decided to let him be in charge, and everyone else lived farther away and worked normal jobs. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. Now, Monday we have plans to meet up with him at the bank to see if he can get my fiances cashier check fixed with her correct name. We are nervous he is going to take her check and not give her the corrected one. So stressfull.
You should get another attorney for yourself, petition to have this person who stole the money removed as executor by the probate court to be able to take control of the estate yourself possibly or have the court appoint a 3rd party. The estate can then sue them and hopefully recover the money for you and the other beneficiaries.
