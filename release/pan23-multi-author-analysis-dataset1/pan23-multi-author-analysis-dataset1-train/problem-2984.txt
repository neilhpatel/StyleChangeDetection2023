Youâ€™re filing for disability, so do you not currently have a disability that the state of Idaho acknowledges as qualification for Medicaid?
3. I have quite a few disabilities that meet the definition suitable for disability, I just didn't want to stop working until I absolutely couldn't anymore because I thought I could juggle a job and treatment effectively. Plus until recently I was homeless and only had one source of income. I have C-PTSD, anxiety, MDD, and ADD/ADHD that went untreated for years. All of those are on the list of eligible conditions by themselves. I'm working with my doctors because it'll be quite easy to prove they're well-documented, I have a treatment plan in place for the C-PTSD at least via EMDR therapy and plans to return to work upon my discharge from the program. The traumas, however, went on for, really until last year. So who knows how long it'll take for it to work. (All have been documented extensively except the ADD/ADHD which wasn't diagnosed until December but that's fine.).
2. Two years ago, a Medicaid expansion was enacted to allow low low-income people who are not considered disabled to go on Medicaid. This allowed me to get Medicaid. During those years I worked part time at a call center and made probably $5k for both years.
