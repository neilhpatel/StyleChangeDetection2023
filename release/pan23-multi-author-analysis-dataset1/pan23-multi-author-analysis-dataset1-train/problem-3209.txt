As for his second and third testimonies, these are either at best greatly exaggerated or at worst flat out lies. You can find countless videos of authentic reproduction armor undergoing penetration tests with various weapons, and in all the ones I've seen, barring /one/ where it was a specially designed brass bolt for a handcannon, /none/ of any of the weapons penetrated plate curaiss, especially not from the front.
No reason to get defensive. You asked the source of this attestation and I provided it. "Myth" is a subjective assessment I am not interested in debating with you. Diaz del Castillo's account leaves room for interpretation, as it is not specific about what defense the darts could pierce. Also, as noted, it is the tepoztopilli Diaz del Castillo states as piercing his armor.
Diaz del Castillo himself had very personal experience with these spears, not just in combat before and during the Battle of Tenochtitlan, but also after. While on campaign in Chiapas, he recorded that.
I do agree with your hypothesis that the textual sources may have referred to lesser padded armor, though penetration against riveted chainmail seems dubious at best, thrusts from non-specialized swords and regular broadheads from bows had a lower success rate when it came to penetrating chain.
No worries and no offense. You are, however, making a lot of absolute statements without much context (and without reference to your sources). The quality of armor in this period was highly variable. I'm going to point you towards this wonderful comment from /u/waritter on.
