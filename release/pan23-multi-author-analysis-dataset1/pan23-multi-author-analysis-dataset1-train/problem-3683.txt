But for your case, since business registration is centralized with the NYS Secretary of State office contact them and inform them that some kind of error resulted in a business' paperwork being sent to your PO Box, and which business it is. Because most likely, one of two things happened: One, the business accidentally transposed digits or something in the PO Box number while registering it, in which case you can point out to the secretary of state that it's THEIR (and all of NY state govt's) problem because their agencies, and the tax authorities, can't contact the business by mail; Two, the business registered their correct mailing address with the Secretary of State, but put down the wrong mailing address onto their website/business cards/investor materials/etc - if that's the case, then you can get the business' correct address, then you can have the post office set up forwarding for the mail with the business name, but not the mail with your name, because there 100% are forms you can fill out for mail to one "resident" to be forwarded but not another (ie, usually for situations like an adult child moving out, or a divorce where one party keeps the house).
Or change your PO box. It is unlikely the mail will let you do that for free, it isn't their fault somebody else has been telling others it is their address. It may continue to occur with that same person or somebody else with the new PO box.
