They want to increase the EV fee from 100, which is fair-ish to both ICE and EV drivers, to 300 dollars which is absolute bullshit. I have no issues with paying for the roads I use but when you do the it like this, it's not just patently unfair because it's far more than one would pay with an equivalent ICE car.
Again, have no issue with paying my fair share of taxes but they need to do it in a fair and not a bullshit arbitrary way and in a way that punishes EV drivers with a flat fee that's more than what a ICE car would generate.
Who reads the odometer? Honor system, so the EV's owner attests to it? If someone lives near the state border and does most of their driving out of state (Kentucky, North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, a few others -- Tennessee is the state bordering the most other states in the US), all the fee would go to Tennessee, none to the other states? At least if there were tax surcharges at EV charging stations everywhere, other states would get a piece when a Tennessee EV owner had to charge their EV outside Tennessee.
