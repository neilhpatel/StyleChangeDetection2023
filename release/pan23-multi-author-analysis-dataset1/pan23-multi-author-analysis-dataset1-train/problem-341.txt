You may have had an argument while you were occupying the room that it was your room because of the then in place and easy to illustrate mutual understanding that each tenant was occupying their own room. You moved out. You no longer have claim to that argument or to that room. Maybe if you move back in and if the landlord chooses to help you you can get their stuff out of that room but the minute you leave again they can take it over again.
Bottom line: You can ask your landlord for whatever you want, but as I said, they have no incentive to get involved in inter-roommate drama. If you put lock on the door, the roommates can complain to the LL who will likely not like the idea of any of the rooms having locks.
Maybe miss communication? Everyone pays for their room? But lease is weird where if anyone wants to leave or get a new roommate they all have to sign for it.
I know a current roommate has changed their lock on their door currently with their own, so Iâ€™m not sure it will be a big deal.
