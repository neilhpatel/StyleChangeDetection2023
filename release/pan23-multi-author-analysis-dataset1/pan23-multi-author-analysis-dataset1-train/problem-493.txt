Honestly, they are surging right now and have been for two weeks. This is the buckle down moment before russia needs to stop and refit for a time. If they can destroy another 100 tanks and kill 20k more russian troops they likely will have this completely in hand. The other side of this of course is the Ukrainian line breaking and not crumpling as it should to maintain friction rates. During these huge surges you should see Ukraine holding or giving little bits of territory as they continuously fall back to prepared defenses, leaving the bombed out and trapped defenses to the russians who always have to advance from compromised cover.
Exactly. It is a plea to continue to be tactical and not give into the emotion of defending each inch of land at the expense of lives. The land will always be there, but the soldiers may not. Wars are won on momentum.
Everyone. They did all that with no war happening and had all the time for preparation. And still failed. These idiots had the answers to the test and still managed to fuck it up and fail.
