So if it was due last Friday does that mean I should have received it by last Friday (if they mailed it) or that they should have mailed it by last Friday? I don’t want special treatment and that’s a good idea to bring someone with me if I’m required to pick it up for some reason. I don’t want a reason anymore, they told me when I called I won’t get one. Thank you for your advice I appreciate it.
The unhappy legal fact is that if you suffer a panic attack at work but have never been through a disability accommodation process with your employer, they can probably dismiss you for cause or for no cause, because their accommodation requirement isn't triggered by your disability itself, but rather by your request for accommodation.
If you did have a disability accommodation with your employer, then your dismissal might be a fact-specific dispute.
A lot of employers switch into CYA mode when there's a chance that there will be a disability or retaliation claim. They shut down any electronic connection to your banking, and won't take your phone calls except through their executives, HR, or attorneys.
