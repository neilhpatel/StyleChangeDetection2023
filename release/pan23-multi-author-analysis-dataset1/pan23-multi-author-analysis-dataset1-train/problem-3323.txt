I'm long overdue for an extended answer of how the Election of 1800 very nearly broke up the United States (and sorry, this ain't going to be where I do so - I've been busy the last month so I'm aiming to do so in the next couple of weeks) but one thing I've also wanted to do first anyway is to watch Hamilton to see how LMM adapted an already somewhat sketchy explanation by Chernow.
Thanks a lot for the detailed answer! I've been really interested in reading Hamilton, and by extension some of the other Founding Fathers, in their own words since watching the musical over the weekend. The National Archives has been a great resource. I'm gonna try to seek some of these out.
This whole dirty politics episode of Hamilton is something Chernow almost completely ignores in his biography - I believe he calls the letter something like a brainless mistake - but at least one other historian notes that it may have been intentional: Hamilton could well have been looking to blow up the existing political party system in an attempt to create a new one to control New York in 1804. This, rather than any sort of patriotism, was arguably why he lobbied against Burr during the electoral college deadlock; the worst possible outcome under that scenario was to have Burr be the leader of a different sort of Republican party which might prove popular in the North and permanently crush Hamilton's own ambitions.
In terms of influence, I believe there are some surviving responses to Hamilton, but the better indication is that prior to Bayard's deal that the breakdown of the balloting was entirely on party lines - it was so fixed that a deathly ill Republican insisted on being carried in by stretcher to make sure his state didn't flip in his absence - and nothing that Hamilton wrote seems to have had any impact in shifting any Federalist votes whatsoever. Of anyone, Adams might have been able to sway a few votes, but he and Jefferson had gotten into a bit of a tete a tete when randomly running into each other on the street in the middle of all this and whatever minuscule chance there was that he might have put country over party vanished at that point; there was good reason that it took another decade before the icy relationship between the two old friends had thawed enough so they began writing each other once more.
