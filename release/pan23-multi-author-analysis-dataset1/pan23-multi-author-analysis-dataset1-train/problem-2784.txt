It appears that humans (and at least some other primates) easily learn fear of some animals, such as snakes and spiders, and can easily learn fear of cockroaches, due to their sudden appearance and rapid movement. Being surprised and startled by cockroaches can lead to fear of cockroaches, which can result in disgust and loathing. Our perception of cockroaches as living in garbage and filth aids that disgust and loathing. The "attar of roaches", the distinctive and unpleasant aroma produced by some species doesn't help humans like them. Thus, dislike and disgust are common modern responses to cockroaches.
There is a broad spectrum of attitudes to cockroaches. Apart from the disgust and loathing you note in your question, there is non-disgusted dislike of them as an annoying household pest. There has been treatment of them (e.g., in parts of Russia and Eastern Europe) as benevolent and useful inhabitants of the household, bringing wealth and prosperity. Sometimes this was specifically due to cockroaches increasing the fertility of one's livestock. When moving to a new house, efforts would be made to move as many of the cockroaches as possible from the old house to the new. (In some parts of Croatia, snakes had a similar beneficious and protective reputation.) This type of attitude might only apply to some species of cockroaches (e.g., black cockroaches) while others (e.g., brown cockroaches) were regarded as annoying pests.

Thank you very much for your answer! Do you know if in a given place (f.e. China, U.S., or Western Europe) the opinion of them changed over time? Were cockroaches regarded the same in Middle Ages?
