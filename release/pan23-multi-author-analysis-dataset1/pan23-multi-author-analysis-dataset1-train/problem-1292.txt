In the U.K. they have a process where if a petition gets enough signatures (100k I think) it's read in parliament. I'd love to have such a petition in the U.S. and if it gets enough signatures we all get to tell Trump what we think of him. Can you imagine the line? It would go around the world.
I want to look Trump straight in the eye, and I want to tell him what a cheap, lying, no-good, rotten, four-flushing, low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating, inbred, overstuffed, ignorant, blood-sucking, dog-kissing, brainless, dickless, hopeless, heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed, stiff-legged, spotty-lipped, worm-headed, sack of monkey shit he is Hallelujah Holy shit! Where's the Tylenol?".
The bipartisan January 6 Committee should convince the "family values and law and order" legislature and congressional party members that he is totally unfit to hold office.
It's tragic. Trump's own family provided testimony to the committee And the MAGA people STILL support him What got me most of all was watching McCarthy beg for help like a scared child on the day of, literally fearing for his life, and then he goes right back to MAGA country. He's a snake. And then I remember that he's far from the worst in the house GOP. Taylor-Greene is just... insane. This is third-world politics.
