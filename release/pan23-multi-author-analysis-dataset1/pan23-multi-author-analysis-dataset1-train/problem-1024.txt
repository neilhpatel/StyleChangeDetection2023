What is NOT fact is the election results shows democracy is being saved or whatever. The “saving democracy” bit was always just campaign fodder for team Blue. It’s not objectively factual. And if people believe it is factual, I can’t understand how the majority of people voting “against democracy” proves democracy is being saved and “team democracy” is doing a good job or whatever.
ummmm wtf are you on about? (no slight on Obama, he didn't have Congress for most of this time) IIRC three of the largest (three largest?) bills ever passed, plus preventing a monkeypox pandemic (he gets at least partial credit for that), CHIPS act, PACT act for veterans affecting by toxic burn pits (like my childhood friend who died young, along with his entire air crew), appointed and confirmed a near record number of judges (for first two years)...
Hmmmmmmmmmm. Yeah you may be right. I can see the argument that the law has been repealed by the introduction of later acts which did not contain the hard limit on seats, but there's also a strong argument that this law continues to control.
