Step 1: Build 3x as much renewables as is actually needed, then there will be enough current generation even when they're only delivering 1/3rd of their max output. (Insert larger numbers if desired.).
But the Japanese, just as they had done with autos, saw a chance to make a buck because there was demand for this product so starting in the 90s, companies like Sharp in Japan began offering slightly lower cost solar panels to the international market based on expired patents from the US. This business was also related to the semiconductor business that the Japanese were well into from the start so it made sense as a side-branch and they brought the prices down far enough by streamlining their manufacturing that demand began to rise for those niche cases like off-grid locations, islands etc that really could afford premium prices for photovoltaic solar panels. Meanwhile, the Japanese started coming up with interesting new tricks like thinner wire saws that could cut the wafers thinner and thinner. This kind of thing made production more profitable. If you could cut the wafer so thin that you could get twice as much out of your ingot, there was money sitting on the table.
