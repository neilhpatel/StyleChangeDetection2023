What was forming from Lenin and his colleagues was a revolutionary ideology that, for revolutionary purposes, worked where it needed to work: in the centre of fledgling Russian industry that was St Petersburg - one of Russia's few islands of progress in an ocean of agriarian backwardness.
Thank you for taking my comments constructively. Again, it was a much better answer than I could have written, and it's much easier to be a critic than to write, I know well.
Overwhelmingly, these parties were staggeringly unrepresentative of the Russian population, and alien to the average Russian person.
This is a very good answer, and thank you for writing it. I want to just add one thing, which is that I feel that the degree of peasant and worker involvement in the revolution of 1905 is a little left out. The revolution of 1905, of course, began with mass industrial strikes. (Admittedly, the inciting incident, Bloody Sunday, could be chalked up to external radicalization by Father Gapon, but he had mass support, is the point.) Even before 1905, many peasants wanted land reform, and when they learned of the violence in Petersburg they engaged in widespread, if not necessarily massive, action, in order to say so. They were certainly not politically conscious by the Marxist definition of the term, I agree, and I understand that this question is getting at the disconnect between Marxist Bolsheviks and the working class. I just think that saying they were only interested in having more and better land implies a lower amount of agency and influence than they eventually did exercise in the revolutions of 1905 and 1917.
