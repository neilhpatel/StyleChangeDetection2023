And theyâ€™ve done it to thousands of other people, torturing, jailing, killing. The open barbarism in the world right now is just staggering.
The only marriage requirement is to do your absolute best to get permission from all living parents and to say "We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God" in front of two witnesses (who can be anyone) and then register it with the local "Spiritual Assembly" (which is the elected local council of the area). They really want you to do that since promoting harmony is a big thing. There isn't actually anyone needed to preform the marriage nor location requirement and the legality of the marriage is depended on your own countries laws. I'm pretty sure a gay couple (with one of both being Baha'i) could get married without the local council putting up much a fight to not register and if they ultimately don't I can't imagine the couple being too upset since it doesn't really mean much.
To give this some context. Baha'i is a religion originating from Iran in the 1800s. Followers have been suppressed and persecuted on (actual) religious grounds due to tension with Islam (and Christianity). In practice they are usually accused in Iran of being agents of foreign powers and attempting to destabilise Iran - an easy "enemy" to rally against.
