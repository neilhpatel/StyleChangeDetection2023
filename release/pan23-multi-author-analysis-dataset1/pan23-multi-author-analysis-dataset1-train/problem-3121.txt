Thanks, fantastic answer! Fascinating that the same chronicler is responsible for both the positive and negative depictions of Justinian/Theodora (and it sounds regrettable that the Secret History wasn't widely circulated for 1000 years, so that we don't have any near-contemporary response to it; feels like the Romans would have been far less likely to lionize previous rulers- was the ruling dynasty more stable in the Byzantine empire, so that criticism of former rulers would be interpreted of as criticism of the current rulers or something?).
Probably. The main source for this is the Secret History, which called her the "Most Depraved of All Courtesans" and did its best to paint her in a very negative light. It's kinda funny - almost every biography I've read about her 1) says she was a prostitute 2) mentions the Secret History is not to be trusted 3) gives the Secret History as their source for saying she's a prostitute. In contrast, the Buildings makes a point of mentioning how, together with Justinian, Theodora "cleansed the state of the pollution of the brothels, banishing the very name of brothel-keepers, and they set free ... the women, providing them with independent maintenance, and setting virtue free.".
