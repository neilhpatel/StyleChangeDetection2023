You need to give more information including location but it sounds like you sublet to him. He needs to pay any agreed upon rent to you. If he does not you need to go through the proper eviction process. You cannot hold his items hostage.
Please give more information as to how "this dude" and his stuff came to be in your apartment, did you let him live there, what your relationship or agreement is/was, how long he's been there, why you think he's a trespasser and not a roommate, what state you are in, what form of written or oral notice has been given to him to leave, etc.
Well then. Seems like this is your landlords issue then. If your lease charge refuse to pay. If this leads to your landlord filing for eviction, then defend yourself in court. Your landlord has given him a separate lease, it will be your landlords responsibility to get him out.
Tell your landlord you have a valid lease and you demand that he either adheres to it (evicts the other guy and his belongings) or allows you to mutually break you lease. Then you find a new place to live.
