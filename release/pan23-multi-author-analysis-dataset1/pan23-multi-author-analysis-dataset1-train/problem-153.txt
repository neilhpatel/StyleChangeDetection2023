Also, the ADA does not recognize emotional support animals so I've been able to ask those claiming their pets to be so and with easily purchased ESA vests on to please remove the animal from the premises, usually without issue.
Hello, here is the . This is the most current primary source for the federal ADA guidelines. I recommend you print this off and have it handy if you receive backlash. Often people who donâ€™t have a real service dog will automatically say defensively that you are not allowed to ask the questions that are outlined under the ADA. So present them with the document. Also, dogs whose sole role is to offer emotional support are not allowed access under the ADA either. You have rights, do not be afraid to follow the ADA Guidelines and assert them. You might ruffle feathers but these are the types of people that create accessibility issues for those of us with real service animals by setting awful examples and undermining the immense training real service animals go through and the incredible life saving jobs they do for us.
>A. If a service animal is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it, staff may request that the animal be removed from the premises.
