We'd see them launch it and the orbit would make it pretty obvious what it was anyway. Plus the X-37b might snap some pics of it. Maybe wave back, with it's little robot arm.
"The resolution of the image shared by the president is estimated at about 10 centimeters per pixel; in comparison, the newest commercial satellites offer customers imagery with a resolution ranging from 30 centimeters to just below one meter per pixel. Of course, those companies arenâ€™t spending the $2 billion or more that it costs the Pentagon to build and launch USA 224 in 2011.".
It's one of these things, like how Russia has a "hypersonic missile" (it's actually a ballistic missile launched from a plane and is nothing like the hypersonic weapons you keep hearing about, which also are mostly over hyped propaganda garbage that wouldn't be that useful for a bunch of reasons.
Yeah I bet. They already have tested folding radio antennas. There is a spy satellite out there with 100 m radio antenna. And it fit in a 5 m fairings. Amd spying doesn't need the precision of a JWST. It is tuned to see the faintest things imaginable at the ends of the universe and accurately map out the early post big bang universe.
20m resolution? Since west retired the spyplane SR-71 I assumed they already got much better gear, already the film in SR-71 could see very small things, I assume they today can see a cars numberplate?
