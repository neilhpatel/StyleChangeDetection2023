It’s not that easy to just decide to put your kids in foster care. IF - and a pretty big if - she calls CPS, they are obligated by law to try to prevent removing the child from the home.
You would likely go to a foster home - laws require the least restrictive placement that can meet the child’s needs. You really do need to stop smoking pot, though. Regardless.
Also, it can be very difficult in some counties to find a foster placement for an older teen. If they have a history of difficult behaviors and discipline at school and if they cannot follow the rules should they get into a foster placement (smoking marijuana, for instance) they may end up in a group home instead. Group homes are not terribly pleasant places.
Probably. Unless it is so dangerous for the child to stay on the home that we have to remove on an emergency basis, the child stays home until we file a petition in family court. They might be removed and put in foster care at court, but usually the children don’t get removed at all.
