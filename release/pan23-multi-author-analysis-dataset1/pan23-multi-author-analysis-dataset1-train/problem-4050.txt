Probably it wasn't about how "he felt" at all. It may very well have been a reasoned concern: that you'd injured yourself and left yourself unable to turn down the TV, or that you were lying dead on the floor. The TV suddenly getting turned off doesn't automatically resolve those issues -- a circuit breaker could have tripped, or the TV's sleep timer could have finally kicked in, or any of a number of other things, or you could have hit your head and been unable to judge whether you're injured or not -- and so it's reasonable, all things considered, for him to bring the police over for a wellness check to make sure you haven't started to decompose, or that you don't need immediate medical attention.
No laws broken. Sorry. You could interpret these events as breach of peace, but you made noise--so it's on you. Stop that. Close windows when you leave. No one cares if the house is falling apart or your issues with authority figures. The long emails don't help.
The average temperature that day in your area as measured by Apple Weather (or whatever service you're looking at) isn't necessarily the same as the temperature right outside your building or the interior temperature inside your building. If the house doesn't get much sunlight, for instance, then it may never warm up to the same temperature as the outside temperature in the winter.
All of which is to say that it's quite possible that the temperature inside your room was below 32 that day with the window open, regardless of what a weather service might say. If you don't want him coming in to close your window when it's below freezing outside, don't wander off with your window open.
