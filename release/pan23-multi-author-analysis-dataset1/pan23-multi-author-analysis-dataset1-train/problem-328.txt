There are a couple of aspects to glazed bomber cockpits. Firstly the vast majority of bombers had glazing for the bomb aimer/bombardier's position to allow them to see and aim at their target. If there was no need for such visibility then the weight and complexity of glazed components was unnecessary and the space could be used for additional armament - see, for example, attacker variants of the Douglas Boston/Havoc/A-20 or North American B-25 Mitchell that had a solid nose rather than glazed. The limitations of visual bombing, particularly at night or in cloud, resulted in the increasing importance of radio navigation and aiming aids during the Second World War and even more so afterwards such that by the introduction of the Boeing B-52 the bombardier had become a Radar Navigator working on screens and instruments in a small, dark compartment (the "Black Hole") rather than a large glazed nose; likewise an RAF Avro Vulcan crew included a Navigator Radar rather than a bomb aimer, though a small panel allowed for visual aiming if required.
I disagree with this response. The glazing needed for bomb aiming was relatively trivial compared to the amount of glass throughout the aircraft. Also visual bombing is a key tactic for decades after ww2, e.g. Korea and Vietnam.
