I'm just curious...why would the room be completely empty? Your son didn't have furniture? What did he sleep on?
You're in a tuff situation and honestly talking to a lawyer who's well versed in this is the best way to go besides the kind of scary idea of moving his stuff out and locking up your room (which would probably make the living situation impossible and very stressful for your son). Maybe your lawyer can talk with the leasing office and they can send a formal letter asking for a remedy for the situation. I'm not saying you should scare the kid into leaving but a letter from a lawyer might be the kick in the but he needs to move (all though he seems like the type to not care and stay in place). Best of luck , I really hope you'll luck out and have a prohibition on subletting in the lease. Cheers.
Anyway, if you really want to do something you need a lawyer and the person who made the sub lease on board, you could likely, with a good investment of time and money, prevail in getting the sub lease annulled and then they could start the long and expensive process of eviction.
Hi. Subleasing is allowed and common in this University town. When my son first occupied this room in August of 2019 ( they renewed their leased for the 2020/21 academic year) it was with friends he met his Freshman year. His roommate graduated early so sublet her room jan. 1 2021. When they all first moved in they very peacefully selected their rooms and stayed there until now.
