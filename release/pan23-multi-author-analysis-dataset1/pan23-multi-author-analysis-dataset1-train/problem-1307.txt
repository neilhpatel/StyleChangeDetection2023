Me too. Especially after grab em by the pussy. But no. Conservatives, it turns out don't actually believe in any of the shit they claim to. Just power, winning, and hurting the libs. 70 million of them voted for that sack of shit a second time. I actually had been trying, unfortunately because of Andrew Sullivan, to give 'conservatives' some credit up to 2016. like ok, maybe some of them aren't totally evil.
