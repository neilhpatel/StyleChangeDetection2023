This is one of my personal favorite lawyer stories of all time. I was a brand new baby lawyer and one of my friends had basically the same thing happen. She said that she found out that her gas was being used for her triplex's hot water heater. She asked me to talk with her landlord, who basically said "too bad" it's not a lot of money. So, I told her to call the gas company and turn off service to her apartment before she went on a vacation. She did, and within 3 hours I got a call from the landlord. I basically told him that she didn't need gas anymore and if others wanted hot water he had to figure it out. He agreed to put the gas in his name going forward. Nice and easy win.
If it's a matter of switching entire circuits the cost might not be too bad, but if it's an older house or seems more likely that there's mixed circuits meaning a lot more work would be necessary, easily in the thousands of dollars range, which is likely why the landlord knew about the issue but didn't fix it.
IANAL- Get everything in writing. E- mail your landlord and explain the situation again, for "clarification". E-mail the neighbor as well. No e-mail, check single party recording consent laws in your state.
That's interesting. I never knew they had a specific complaint, though it does happen a lot. I'll make sure to get my customers links to our power company's version of this form when dealing with this in the future.
