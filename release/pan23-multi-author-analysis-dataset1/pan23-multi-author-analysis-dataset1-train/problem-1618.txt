Not to mention probably more Palestinians die from failed rocket attacks by Hamas than Israeli activities, I've seen so much footage at this point of rockets being shot by Hamas and then blowing up in the Gaza Strip.
Ugh. And another person thinking opposition to the Israeli government is antisemitism. It’s not. I don’t give a rat’s ass about religion. Jewish, Muslim, Christian, etc, it’s all the same shit to me. What I do care about is abolishing colonialist apartheid states.
All ethnic Jews are indigenous to the Levant as proved by archeology, genetic studies, linguistic studies, and extensively documented history.
Not true, but go off. Israel has been extremely - and I do mean extremely - lenient with Palestine compared to how most governments would act. Mind you it's not for moral reasons so much as they're already under so much scrutiny for being Jewish that any action they take to combat terrorism and protect themselves is seen as antagonistic. Turkey/Russia/even NATO all act with far, FAR less prejudice in taking out terrorists in the ME than Israel.
Really? You must be on a different reddit. The word Israel gets mentioned on here and everything becomes about how evil it is and how they bomb kids. Hell Jews in America are talked about and it comes back to Israel.
