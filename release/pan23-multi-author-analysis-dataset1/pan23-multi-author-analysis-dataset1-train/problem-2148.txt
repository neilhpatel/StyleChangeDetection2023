The question describes the traditional picture of British anti-submarine efforts in the interwar period. It is ultimately derived from Stephen Roskill's Naval Policy Between the Wars, and to a lesser extent from Arthur Marder's monograph The Influence of History on Sea Power. These two authors were hugely influential on the historiography of the Royal Navy - Roskill wrote the Royal Navy's official history of the Second World War, while Marder wrote one of the most detailed works on its actions in the First. Roskill alleges that the RN believed that the development of ASDIC (sonar, in American parlance) made the submarine useless. He claims that 'not one.
Edit: Also interested in if the Royal Navy considered/tried some kind of "band-aid" solution like sticking depth-charges on an otherwise normal merchant ship, if that is at all something that can be bolted-on without completely changing the ship.
Thank you for this. I was looking for a similar answer not long ago on a similar question, which this has helped me with greatly!
