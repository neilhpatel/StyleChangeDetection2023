This doesnt make sense to me. The GOP has since Roe v Wade was handed down, targeted that decision. Tons and tons of money and manpower was devoted for over a half-century into reversing that decision. It was no secret. They have plotted for decades to reverse it.

Zero Sympathy. None. You chose the party of hate and control. Don't cry when you are full of hate and are controlled. No ammount of rearing or parenting makes a child a hardcore faciest punk, and that is because of free will. You have free will and independent thought, you make a choice, live and die with it.
