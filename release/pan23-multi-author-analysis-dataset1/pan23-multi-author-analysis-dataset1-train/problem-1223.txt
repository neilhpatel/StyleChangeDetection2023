Another system, by the geographer Eratosthenes, had only 8 winds, and this was the basis for the octagonal “Tower of the Winds” in Athens, which was probably built during the Roman period. The Romans borrowed the concept of 8 winds and made further divisions into 16 and 24 winds. But in the end the 12-wind system won out - it conveniently matched up with other things associated with 12:
