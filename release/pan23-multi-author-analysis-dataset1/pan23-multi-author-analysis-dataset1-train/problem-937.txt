NAL, just a lurker. Sounds like this "lady" needs to be reminded that it's a federal law that your wife be provided both the time and a non-bathroom space to pump. If I were her, I'd reach out to either/both the school's HR department and/or teacher's union (of applicable). I would think that both/either would want to nip this in the bud before it escalates into am obvious legal issues that would open them to liability (again, NAL, but my thinking is that if this woman gets it in her mind to barge in on your wife to prove a point, your wife could make a car for harassment, assault, etc. My understanding is that the employer has to provide a non-bathroom space with a locking door.).
