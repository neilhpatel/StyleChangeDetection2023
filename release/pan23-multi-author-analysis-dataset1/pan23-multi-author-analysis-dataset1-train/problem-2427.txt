Because McCarthy had 2 entire months to count votes, compromise his power to ensure the Speakership, and to know the results of the vote before even going in and he probably hasn't done shit. This reminds me of the 10+ years that Republicans had to come up with their own health care plan to put in place after they tried like 20X to take away Obamacare, and they said they did, but they were actually only interested in taking away Obamacare. All this isn't to say that their isn't nefarious Republican shit going on here where those members said they would vote for McCarthy before voting for Jordan or someone else. Also doesn't answer the mystery of why they would continue to hold 3 additional ballots without actually taking the time to secure those votes, other than this party obviously not understanding the popular definition of insanity.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Heâ€™s not gonna make it. I see no way that these 20 people change their mind. McCarthy will reluctantly bow out, and some other placeholder will come in that the Freedom Caucus can you pretend to accept.
