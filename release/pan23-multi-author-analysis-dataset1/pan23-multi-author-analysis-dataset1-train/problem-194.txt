I'll repost something I wrote recently on what 'bias' is in terms of historical study, as it is misunderstood, and the quest for the mythical 'unbiased source' is a wild goose chase. The short of it is that all sources are biased in their own way, and what you really are looking for isn't the lack of bias, but how that bias is handled. As a side note, the thread this was written for , so it is at least tangentially related, but not directly. the issues you raise and don't know what to trust, many of them are covered in this subreddit, such as from /u/kochevnik81 which is, frankly, one of the best summaries you'll find on the Holodomor and the current state if historiography, in my humble opinion.
Honestly? You've already found probably the best single online resource to get accessible, quick and reliable historical information on any given aspect of history. While nothing beats doing your own research on a subject, this takes time and resources that many of us can't commit to every possible subject we're interested in. Here, you have access to a community of people who have for the most part already done that research, and really enjoy talking about it. This includes the history of twentieth century socialism, which has quite a few active flaired users with established expertise in the area, myself included for some of the more obscure chapters of that history. has dozens of answers that may be relevant to your interests. has plenty of suggestions for places to start doing your own research, if that's what you prefer.
