I am confused — are you staying extra and not being paid at all? Have you thought of just working the 40 some hours? And let them bring in a floater.
"Appellant worked these extra shifts voluntarily. Compensation for the extra work—in excess of forty-four hours—was paid according to an hourly “Compensation Rate” determined by dividing appellant's weekly guaranteed salary by forty-four, multiplying the number of hours worked over forty-four by the resultant amount and then adding “Premium Pay” of six dollars per hour.".
Although exempt employees are most often compensated via an annual salary, salaries may also be calculated in monthly, weekly, hourly or shift-based increments. Full-time exempt employees work a minimum of 40 hours per week, and exempt employees in a number of sectors are frequently burdened with hours that surpass this number.
Malicious compliance. Just work the hours they pay you for. If stuff doesn't get done have that corporate number ready so they get to deal with pissed off customers If you're not being compensated then stop covering their asses.
