If a person suspects or knows of abuse it needs to be reported to law enforcement. Always. Every single time. Not to an employer. Not even the parents (parents can be ashamed, scared, disbelieving, etc.) When I was in seminary studying for the priesthood it was hammered into us; the first call is to the police. Always.
Mirroring - that religion (and most other religions really) just hate on everyone doing what they forbid their followers to do instead of you know living life and not being judgmental assholes. All they breed is repressed self hating people and this is the result (like republicans they call out people that they think are doing horrible things but itâ€™s always them that are doing those horrible things).
