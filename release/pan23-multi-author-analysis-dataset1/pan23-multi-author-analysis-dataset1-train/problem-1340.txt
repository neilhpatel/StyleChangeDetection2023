Trade networks in other parts of the Americas were similarly vast; the people of the Amazon Rainforest, for example, imported jade from Guatemala for their jewellery. The people of Chaco Canyon in the Southwest imported parrots from Mesoamerica. While the people at either end of a trade network wouldn't necessarily know everything about the place where their goods were coming from, they would have maintained pretty well-rounded knowledge systems about other places. Turtle Island is threaded with rivers which Native peoples used to travel and communicate over long distances. The longest known migration of a single tribe in pre-contact times was the migration of the Navajo (Din√©), who moved from what is now Canada and Alaska to what is now the American Southwest, a distance of around three thousand miles. Other groups travelled significant distances for hunting, migrations, warfare and raiding, or relocating after environmental disasters.
Sure! To be fair, it's my own hypothesis that these women were moving to found clans; but I don't think it would be a controversial addition to what is known about the subject. It is known that they pair bonded, traveled alive, and are associated with women in Puebloan kiva murals and Mimbres representational ceramics. But the context, as with context always; is quite messy. Many if not all were eventually sacrificed and their feathers (and parts such as wings) were traded onward. Some places didn't import whole birds but only wings (i.e. for the feather trade). Later Puebloans like at Paquime had a large structure with cages for lots of birds because they were the primary first stop between sites in Mexico and the Puebloan region. So there were many ways that Puebloans traded and interacted with parrots, besides the possible narrative I described.
