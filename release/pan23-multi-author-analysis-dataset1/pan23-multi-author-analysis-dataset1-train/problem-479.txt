The work of his that I have read and which both documents the genocide and investigates culpability is A Shameful Act. He has put out several other works since but I have not read them.
The liberal line in Turkey is heavily discredited as tacit supporters of authoritarian islamism, similar to a politically liberal version of neoliberal economist support for Pinochet dictatorship but with even worse results. What they wrote and still write doesn't have much credibility with any political line in Turkey including remaining liberals that took refuge in CHP. They didn't understand Turkey back then and they still don't. Academically discredited, politically hated and socially marginalized, simply their word holds no weight anymore.
A couple of others in the same vein would be Fatma Müge Göçek and Uğur Ümit Üngör. Göçek has an Ottoman history background and often touches on the treatment of Armenians in the late empire. Üngör is from a newer generation and is less an Ottomanist than a genocide scholar so he also writes on non-Ottoman topics.
How about something by Taner Akçam, who is well-known as a Turkish scholar who acknowledges the Armenian Genocide? Being Turkish, you will avoid the anti-Turkish subtext of some other historians, and he's also an academic and treats the subject accordingly.
