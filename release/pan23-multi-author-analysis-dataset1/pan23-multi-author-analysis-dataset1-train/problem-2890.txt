Certainly many peoples have moved on the steppe and some have moved off the steppe. These movements have pushed other peoples into motion. The key appears to be the mobility of pastoralists on the steppe, which allows rapid expansion and movement of cultures. Noting the importance of mobility, we should also see movements of maritime peoples and cultures, and there are many examples of this: Greek colonisation of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean (Anatolia, Italy, France), Carthage, Viking colonisation, the Polynesian expansion, the settlement of Madagascar, the Arab conquests of Iberia and Sicily, the Indianisation of SE Asia.
But all these measures aren't terribly precise. The place names can tell us that A was gradually replaced by B, but not how. Was it peaceful? Was it an elite takeover? Did a whole population move in? Did they live in the same places, or in separate settlements? How did this change over time? Sometimes archaeology can tell more, but not always.
For less-documented events, we can try to tell by archaeology and language and genetics. Place names, for example, tend to persist through a cultural replacement in some relation to the suddenness and thoroughness of the replacement. If "foreign" place names persist, it's some indication that the previous culture and subsequent culture existed together for some time. (England, for example, is full of Roman-derived names, despite being several cultural changes removed.) If no names from earlier inhabitants persist, they probably didn't share much time, if any, with the new population.
