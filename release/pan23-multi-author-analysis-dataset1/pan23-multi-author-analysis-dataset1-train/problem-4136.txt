To get a public defender, you have to be indigent (which OP likely is) and be at a point in the criminal legal process where you have the right to an attorney. The Supreme Court has said that this starts at the first appearance before a judicial officer or when formal charges are filed, whichever comes first. OP hasn't been brought before a judge yet so he doesn't yet have the right to a public defender (assuming Arizona tracks federal standards and doesn't offer better treatment to the accused).

I fortunately already have a freeze on my credit due to being the victim of a rental scam about a year ago, but as far as speaking with an attorney goes, my only concern is of course cost - as you can perhaps tell from my above description, I'm not exactly wealthy, raising kids and a sick mom or going to college don't pay, my whole family is pretty decently below the poverty line. Are there any avenues to seek at attorney that won't jeopardize things like payments for my mother's cancer or epilepsy medications or food - because these are the realistic cost/benefit analysis factors I'm having to consider here. Note that I do not qualify for a court appointed attorney as the court is not pursuing prison time.
