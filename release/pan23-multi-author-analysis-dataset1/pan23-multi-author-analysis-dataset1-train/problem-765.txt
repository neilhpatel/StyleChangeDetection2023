Your right. Hes using his kids as well trying to say they will be taken by CPS because they were in the other room when it happened. I understand them investigating but I don't see them just removing them unless there is more to the story then what involves me. Its just another tactic to make me not follow through.
CPS is unlikely to order outright removal unless he's a danger to his children (in which case, honestly, removal is a better outcome than leaving them in danger), but if he's spending time in jail either pending trial or after conviction, he's going to need to make arrangements for his kids one way or another. If he doesn't, or if nobody's available to take them, CPS will also get involved at that point. If CPS determines that he is not an immediate danger to his children but is not adequately caring for them, then they'll generally try to work with him to resolve those issues - for example, by recommending anger management, if his childcare issues are anger-related.
I don't trust him. I'm sure these are all manipulative ways to get me to do what he wants. Then he won't follow through and if he comes after me again, they probably won't take me seriously.
