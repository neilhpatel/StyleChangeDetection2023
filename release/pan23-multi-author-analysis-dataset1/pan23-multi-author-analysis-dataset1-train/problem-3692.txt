It would depend on exact details, circumstances and laws of the jurisdiction where it occurs and is indeterminable here. Just don't take cash.
You are right my friend, very young kid covered in tattoos up to the neck (no real Issue with that normally I myself have plenty of tattoos) but I don’t see how any kid this young has that kind of money laying around let alone ready to pay cash in full unless it’s daddy’s money or illegal I really don’t see any real justification on why it can’t be illegally obtained money just doesn’t seem like the type of person to be in any sort of legal business making that kinda cash.
Follow the rules and procedures for selling a car in your state. The rules vary a lot, but you generally can't go wrong with making copies of the title and Bill of Sale, any any receipts for cash or checks, and proper odometer disclosure and signatures that match the buyer's ID. Many states require you to remove the plates. Many also offer a "Seller's Report of Sale" document to relieve you of liability for the car.
