What's the big deal? Why do they try to cling to this mortal life so hard when true happiness and freedom awaits them in heaven? Go see Jesus, Old man. You scared, bro? 🤔.
"As pope, Benedict came under fire for failing to act against widespread child sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic church and has repeatedly denied his role in knowingly covering up abuse, although in 2010 he admitted that the church 'did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action'.".
Historically and with my experience in catholic school stateside, my personal opinion of anyone and most everyone at the Vatican is just Nazi/Racist/Sexist/Rapist/Bullshit participants or observers and “other cheek turners” who’ve just helped sow discord for generations. Fuck him.
Man, what a piece of work you have to be to flaunt an "only 5%", next time add the "5% systematically abused members of their communities and were protected by the church for decades" so that way you can really smear that ex-atheist label you seem to enjoy.
No. He’s showing that regardless of me stating personal opinion or me hating on the entirety of the Vatican despite their attempts at “PR Control” in the recent years because I dislike all organized money machines with religious zealots telling ANYONE how to live their lives as forceful as they like to… So no. None of what I said is “wrong”. It’s just not in line with your thoughts or personal reasonings on the matter and you don’t like that, neither does he. But I’ll stand by my statement. “Fuck Him” and I’ll add to it with fuck the rest of the worlds organized religious leaders too.
