There's not awfully much to go on here. A good start would be identifying the cannon ball. Is it perfectly round and solid, or hollow, or is it shaped like a cylinder with one end flattened? How much does it weigh and what is its diameter?
Theoretically, yes, but highly unlikely. Location in this particular case could matter, but if, as you say, its in a place that direction cannot be determined, all we'd have to go by was the type of shell, caliber, and weight. These can tell us quite a bit, however. I would assume when you say "cannonball" you are basically describing it as a round shot, made of cast iron, and likely solid. In other words, it looks like we think of a cannonball looking. These were widely used, but were among lots of other types that included exploding shells, called "shells," that were hollow cast iron rounds fill with explosives and a fuse attached. These could be rounded balls, but were also made in a typical "bullet" shape. The navy sometimes employed chain shot, which was two balls held together by a chain, that was designed to tear through ships' rigging. There was also canister, which was a metal can filled with iron or lead balls, essentially converting a cannon into a giant shotgun. This was primarily used against attacking infantry.
