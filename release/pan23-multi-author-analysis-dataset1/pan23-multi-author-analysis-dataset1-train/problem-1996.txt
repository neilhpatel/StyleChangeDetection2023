Again, unfortunately, school boards can still remove them for what is considered ‘obscenity’ which is almost randomly defined. What the person down the road from me considers obscene, such as a book depicting a gay romance, and what I consider obscene are completely different. I can easily make an argument that the Bible, containing many acts of genocide, incest, rape, kidnapping, slavery, infanticide, patricide, matricide, absurd misogyny and many other offensive acts coupled with ongoing and explicit threats of eternal damnation is, in fact, obscene. The person down the road may well object to my definition, just as I object to his. Should the gay romance and the Bible both be removed? Should one be removed? (proving a superiority of definition of obscene but under what guidelines?) or should both remain since two different people can make solid cases that the book in question is not obscene in spite of the other’s objections to their choice.
