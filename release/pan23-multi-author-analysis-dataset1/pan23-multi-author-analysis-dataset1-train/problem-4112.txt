In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes, it does. But for about a dozen years that liberty was suspended in the name of Homeland Security. I knew about its suspension via The Patriot Act, but wasn’t clear on if the repeal of that particular detail became permanent (it was, in 2014’s National Defense Authorization Act) I knew there’d been some back and forth before it became permanent. I suggested it because so many right wingers fought for the right for us to not only arrest “suspected” terrorists but also abscond w/them to G-Bay. Figured it only seemed right to subject those same Tough On Crime crusaders to that very same treatment. (Yes, I’m aware Ms. Schieve is not affiliated w/a party but it’s fair to say she leans left and is perceived that way by many on the other side).
>The complaint also alleges, without offering additional evidence, that the company “installed similar tracking devices on other vehicles of multiple other prominent community members.”.
Which seems ridiculous to me. In a better world we would enshrine an actual right to privacy in the constitution. The courts have fallen back on the "no expectation privacy in a public space" but there's a big difference between noticing someone drive past your house and tracking their movements everywhere they go for a month. Or all the online tracking companies do. Just because each piece of data might be public doesn't mean that the sum aggregate should be.
