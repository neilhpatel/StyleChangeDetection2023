It got so bad that in February 1865, shortly after the dramatic passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, Senator Jacob Collamer of Vermont decided something needed to be done to liberate the minds of the boys at the front from such filth, since the US Postal Service had become "the vehicle for the conveyance of great numbers and quantities of obscene books and pictures, which are sent to the Army, and sent here and there and everywhere, and that it is getting to be a great evil" and using his position as chair of the relevant committee proposed an amendment to a pending bill on postal laws - originally intended to codify some of the restrictions on seditious material during the war - to include a prohibition on obscene material too, with fines up to $500 for those who did so. Concern even arose for the poor postmasters newly empowered to seize such morally decrepit material, although Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland got to the true point about what would happen to it given they were political appointees of the most base character, "After the postmaster takes the material out, what is he to do with it? May he circulate it as he thinks proper?" (And yes, the answer was that he probably did for a tidy profit.).
