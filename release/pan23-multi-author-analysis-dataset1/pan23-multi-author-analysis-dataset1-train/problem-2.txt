It doesn't matter what community you are in, if you are wrong then you are wrong. This bill requires all states to acknowledge marriages in states where it is legal via Full Faith and Credit.
And you'll be able to do all of that with this bill because it requires states to follow the Full Faith and Credit Clause for any marriage.
I don't think this is true, those who already have legal marriages have to be recognized according to Full Faith and Credit. Potentially, if gay marriage was overturned, only those who get married after that would have to go out of state to get married and be recognized.
Well this bill actually covers gay marriage, unlike the 1st amendment. So if you were interested in protecting gay marriage, you would be supportive of this bill instead of trying to make an unrelated and irrelevant 1st amendment argument.
Considering the precedent establishing gay marriage was the 14th amendment and not the 1st, the argument does not hold any weight.
What part of the 1st amendment allows for gay marriage? The original ruling in favor of gay marriage didn't even include the 1st amendment in their justification.
