But the bank or the servicing company should be able to pull video footage of your use of the machine, pull logs of your usage what you were or trying to do at the time, correlate that to logs and errors on the machine and finally, do an actual count of the money lodged or collected from the machine and determine if they have an unexpected overage(an extra amount of cash they can't account for on official transactions).
It has been 15 days. Technically 8 because they messed up the first claim and put in an incorrect amount. I submitted the second claim with correct details on the 12th. I submitted a complaint at CFPB and the claims department at wells fargo took down the ATM ID where the incident happened. Apparently they did not know which ATM the incident took place. But other than that, what more should I do?
no, actually. the ATM's have a journal-records all of the transactions. yours should be on there as accepting the pin and card. but sometimes when they malfunction, it wont show. not sure why. BUT it will show a skip in the transaction numbers, so they should be able to identify when you were there in the journal. they need to do a complete audit of the machine, if they haven't already. follow up with whomever you've been in contact with every few days. good luck!
The machine should have logs, and physically have your money, they need an investigation when the machine was serviced and cleaned out or restocked and what monies they had they can't account for.
