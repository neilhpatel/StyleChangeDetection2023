Like that other response said, repealing most of Trumps Executive Orders would be a great start. Prosecuting Trump and his people for every crime committed, like an actual country with laws for everyone would do. None of this “we gotta heal and the only way to do it is ignore Trump’s crimes and let him get away with it.” There were so many abuses of our government that were “legal” and illegal that got totally brushed under the rug, if Biden did one or any of them he’d be impeached and removed from office by a Republican house and senate so fast you would get whip lash.
Great points. Furthermore Trump double dealt to his own charity for the purchase of a painting (of himself of course) and had to shut his “charity” down due to the tax fraud charges….yes somehow the IRS could figure out whether he’s committing personal fraud on his returns because he had too many companies?
