Wow, sorry for your loss(es). This sort of reads like a final examination. Let's see if I can break it down:
The insurance companies generally are not allowed to release information about insurance policies to anyone except to the executor or personal representative or to the listed beneficiaries. Since this is such an unusual situation, you are absolutely required to open up probate so that an executor or personal representative will immediately receive a document called letters testamentary, that will give official authority to claim any and all assets.
Thank you so much. Yep you have it right - sorry for the super fun final exam. Goal is to get rid of the car - surrogate's court feedback was that because the beneficiary (mom) died before changing the title, THEY have to issue a NJ DMV form, so I'll find myself with these very pleasant folks. For the insurance companies, one wouldn't speak to me at all initially, but the brother's family lawyer mailed me some forms and the info he was able to ascertain - that the benefit now goes to my father's heirs (but probably as you said it would go via his estate first, my mom and siblings and I arent listed as contingents). I think in NJ, the "next of kin" process is for people who aren't certain like you described... but I'm hoping to skip that if I can do so. They also implied I should only arrive once, absolutely positive of the value of everything, and that "amending" isn't really an option, which I sort of think is BS. Thanks again.
As soon as the personal representative gets the letters testamentary, that document is what they will give to the insurance company to release the information.
It should be very simple for the insurance companies to send a letter to you that shows the payout value of the policies if you ask them to do so. If you have not retained the services of a probate attorney for advice and counsel as you go through the probate process, then please get one.
