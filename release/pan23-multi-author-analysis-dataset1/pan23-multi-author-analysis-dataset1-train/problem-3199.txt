My point is that most russians are either active or apathetic fascists, and that imperialism has been a fundamental part of their culture for a very long time.
There is plenty of evidence that most russians either support the war or don't care, making them fascists, along with all the other laws that didn't receive mass pushback. And the reason Russia is that way is because you constantly make whataboutist excuses to avoid responsibility and facing the harsh reality that must be fixed. It is not putin's clones doing everything.
These are obviously not laws passed in the interest of "protecting our children", given their callous disregard for life both at home and basically anywhere Russia conducts its foreign policies and "special military operations". It can only be concluded, along with those distracting and dividing with their culture war legislation against the LGBTQ+ community everywhere, that they are just projecting, are hugely insecure in their own sexuality, disproportionately pedophiles themselves, and afraid of allowing that light of justice and truth shine on themselves lest it disturb the shit out of everyone.
