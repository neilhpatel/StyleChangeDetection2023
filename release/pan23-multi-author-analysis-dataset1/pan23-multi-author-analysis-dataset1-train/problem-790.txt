You MIGHT try going up to the next level of managment and appealing to them. But this may not do any good at all.
Knowing that it is generally human nature to elect the easiest course of action, such as throwing your hands up, giving in, taking the financial hit, cutting ties however possible as quickly as possible, and getting out and away from that situation is less personally stressful and as the client, of course a (good) lawyer would logically advise that their client do that.
That is my next step. I am doing the intake process for a lawyer and giving him all of my information now. I’m also going to see if I can find a contingency lawyer as well but I know that’s going to be very difficult as well but I will try. I’m just not the type of person to allow myself to be bullied by anyone so even if I do end up having to move I want to cause an equally big nightmare and financial upheaval to them as they are trying to do with me rn. I’m thinking of also filing restraining orders against my property manager and BLR in ngeneral so they can’t speak to me or leave notices/letters anymore.
Honestly. Moving is probably the easiest thing to do here. CA is very pro tenant. But this may not be winnable. But without investing a lot of time, money, and effort Into it.
