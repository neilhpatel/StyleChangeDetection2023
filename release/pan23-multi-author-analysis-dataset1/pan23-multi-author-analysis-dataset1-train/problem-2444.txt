The biggest problem with using these guys words against them is that they don't stand by anything they say. For them, politics is theatre and nothing more. They get paid handsomely with dark money to say stupid shit with a straight face, vote reliably for their sponsors, and do whatever makes the biggest ratings in the conservative cinematic universe. It is all a kayfabe to them. Their only moral prerogative is selfishness and none of them expect to be alive long enough to see the consequences of their malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance. In other words, they are unjust people exploiting society. It is just an absolute shame that our system of government is unable to purge naked corruption from public office.
Attacking itself? More like the four dozen or so noisy shits that claim to represent the Republican party have split into factions, and everyone else is waiting for one faction to win so they can do an occasional TV interview without getting caught in the crossfire.
Yes and no. She certainly wields more base power than a McCarthy (who from all descriptions I’ve encountered is more enamored with the celebrity than actual governance), but that base has a limited ROI if you lose the deep pocket (screw the poors) conservatives with bonkers rhetoric. They didn’t mind when it meant their team wins, they mind now that it means their team looses.
