Calling someone when she says something suicidal is a bit tricky in this case. When she first moved in she'd do it often and tricked one of her facebook friends into believing she was in danger of killing herself by saying suicidal things and asked if she wanted to see how cut up her wrist was, so that person friended me online and begged I check on her but she was sleeping soundly cut-free. At that time we told her no more suicidal threats or we'd have to consider kicking her out. So she stopped saying those things to us but she still convinces people on facebook she's suicidal and is actively hurting herself to the point we received multiple other friend requests begging to check on her and even an occasion where cops showed up for a wellness check on her because someone was worried and called. But suicidal or not she always acts normal and denies anything happened. But we keep the screenshots.
You’re housing an unstable mentally ill individual who needs psychiatric intervention. It’s that simple which, unfortunately, makes it that complicated.
