Imagine that the state went to trial on Richards. How do you imagine the state would prove its case? His victim was abused from the age of 3 to the age of 5, when she said something to a grandparent about it. There was little or no physical evidence of abuse. Normally an out of court disclosure of abuse is hearsay. The ONLY way to prove those cases is to bring the victim to court. In most states the hearsay rules make some exceptions for sexual abuse disclosures by a very young child. But those are still exceedingly difficult. How ironclad and reliable is the statement of a 5 year old when it's tested in court? What if you combine a pending divorce case and the child being in the custody of the spouse? SUre the spouse will say she never considered divorce until the allegations were made, but you only have to convince one juror to throw a wrench into a case. I've tried sex abuse cases, that's actually something I do regularly as a child welfare lawyer. They are hard things to do.
While nuisance lawsuits are a problem, I think giving judges the sole authority to declare a lawsuit to be a frivolous political attack and assess a fine against the plaintiff would give political judges far too much power to silence their opposition.
Couch could have been charged as an adult. He was not. So that's one point of contention with the prosecutor's office but set that aside for the moment.
