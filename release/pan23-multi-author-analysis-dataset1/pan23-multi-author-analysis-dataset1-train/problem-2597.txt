I’m not saying the US is or is not sending enough modern weapons to Ukraine, I’m pointing out that it’s effectively a drop in the bucket for us monetarily, in exchange for a guaranteed ally (and, let’s face it, vassalship) with the second biggest country in the region (unless, of course, this all ends and Zelenskyy disagrees with the US in some way, or refuses to do as we say…).
No they haven't. They've decided their temporary comfort is worth more. India doesn't even recognize that they've taken a "loan of blood" for this oil. One day that loan will be paid back.
India switches to buy Russian oil at ridiculously low prices, after western Europe moves in to outbid and poach energy supplies from the middle East, where the production has remained the same, thus making that energy unaffordable for most developing nations.
Then what you said made no sense. In the context of our conversation, Indians are calling anyone from the west racist due to anyone from the west having criticism of India. It's everywhere. Including the people who have responded to me.
