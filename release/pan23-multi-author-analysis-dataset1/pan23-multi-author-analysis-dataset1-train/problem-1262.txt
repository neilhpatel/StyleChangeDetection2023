I’m glad we got out. It wasn’t perfect but it could have been way worse with what Biden inherited. We had 6,000 total troops when he took over. The numbers were so low that we needed to really depend on local Afghan security forces. This is why we pulled out of Bagram because we couldn’t trust the Afghan military anymore.

Biden should have awarded some medals of honor to the crews that pulled off that historically unprecedented evacuation to turn focus to how much of a success that actual implementation of the withdrawal was, even if the political situation that preceded the withdrawal meant that - no matter how successful the operation of withdrawing was - that the taliban would surge to fill the vacuum.
