Think about a single radio frequency that various people with walkie-talkies can transmit on and receive. So the first thing a speaker trying to reach "George" will say is "George; come in, George." George perks up and answers "George here. Go ahead, Tom." Same with telegraph operators along a circuit in, for example, the different stations and control towers of a railway line. Dozens of telegraphers might be on that same circuit. The first characters transmitted would typically be the two-character code of the station for which the message was intended. That station would respond with a short code indicating it was listening and copying down the message. Other short codes known as could ask the sender to repeat a section, indicate that the message was finished, and similar things. When things were busy, it might be a couple of minutes before the wire got quiet and you could send your message. In the wee hours of the morning, telegraphers would chat about the weather or whatever just to stay awake.
That's fascinating! So suppose you were in Richmond and needed to send a message to San Francisco. With there being no direct line, you'd ask a nearby station to forward your message along, and that station would then ask another station to again send the message along, and so on. Was there a map or some sort of sheet reference to know which station you should ask to forward your message along? A sort of diagram of who's connected to who, which stations could forward the message along, which ones were 'dead ends' on the network so to speak, or was there another way to efficiently forward messages?
