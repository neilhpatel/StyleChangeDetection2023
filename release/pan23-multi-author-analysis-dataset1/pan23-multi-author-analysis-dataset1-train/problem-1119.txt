Do you not know what the talking fillibuster is? It means that any member can keep a bill open for debate so long as they are actually standing up there and debating itâ€™s to prevent people from rushing bills through, no one can talk forever, the most anyone was ever able to delay a vote with it was less than a week. There is no 60 vote threshold for anything. This is how it was until 2010 when McConnell got rid if it under Obama.
Without gerrymandering (legal how?) and the electoral college the parties wouldn't seem so evenly divided. One party consistently gets all the perks of corruption and that is all by design, we can now easily design better. Scotus has even been tainted due to partisan power lust, no branch of government is immune or clean. Thus they all need redone and reset, a whole new system would be the easiest way. Get rid of loose wording that let citizens united decision ever be a thing. Write in the new constitution our leaders can't build a world army for the rich to bully others off the backs of regular citizens. Man it could be really great, people just need to rally behind it. The mechanisms to do so are already there, we need but do it.
