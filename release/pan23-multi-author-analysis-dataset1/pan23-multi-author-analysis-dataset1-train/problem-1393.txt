While I think this is quite plausible, I also feel like this is one of those stories you really need to hear the other side of. Surely people with disabilities fly on their airline all the time, and having seen some of the passenger meltdown videos out there that result in people getting booted off the plane, it would be enlightening to know what the employees had to say about this incident.
Right. Last week I read this story about Qatar Airways throwing a "model" of the plane and calling her "too fat".
i've been disabled for 7 years now, in the first 6 i shrugged off most problems because my family could shield me from them, now that i live alone i realized how a lot of the problems are systemic and i've become an activist (not just online) i've learn a lot of laws and rules i did not know before and beacause of that i'm more probable to sue or threaten sueing someone beacuse of their inaccessibility, would you say that my POV would be lesser worthy just beacause I'm an activist?
Maybe you are a bot but I'll agree qatar airlines was amazing and probably the best airline. Maybe 5 years ago id have said Cathay but post covid no way. Maybe emirates or singapore can give it a run for its money.
