Burnside is really the only (major) commander that could be considered inept, or incompetent, at least in my opinion. If McClellan/Pope/Whomever had the Cavalry Corps of Late 1863 onwards, and if Stoneman had kept his position with Hookers' army and not gone off on his raid, I'd wager that their respective failures would turn out differently. Once Grant came into the theater, it was fairly obvious what Lee's military capabilities were, and Grant knew that as long as HE dictated the Operational Direction and Tempo, Lee would be forced to respond in kind. Sheridan being Sheridan, and the Union Cavalry Corps becoming incredibly competent didn't hurt.
It's very much a Lost Cause thing. Lee never once took the strategic initiative after a victory- he would wait for the Union to come back and then hope the loss would be enough to lower Northern morale. Not to mention, his decision to invade the North a second time over relieving the Confederate garrison at Vicksburg was probably the biggest blunder of the war.
