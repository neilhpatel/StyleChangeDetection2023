That’s not exactly accurate. They said the quality of the polls has dropped significantly over the last decade or so. There are lots of polls out there and some of them are very high quality in their methodology but there are lower participation rates, unclear geographic representation because of cell phones, fewer land lines and even fewer people who will answer an unknown pollster and respond honestly.
Idk something is emerging here. This mid term saw the second highest youth vote in mid term history. The first? 2018.
It's nice to see what pollsters are saying and what their data gathering and aggregation analysis is suggesting, but fundamentally for voters (as individuals), disregard all of that, do one's due diligence in reading up on what's on the ballot, and then making an informed decision, and then making their vote.
Agreed. I live in a place where my vote doesn’t matter. I will be completely washed away by the volume from the other side. I completely ignore that, I read up on the candidates, learn about any ballot initiatives or bond proposals, and I vote knowing I’m tilting at windmills but the only way that outcome will ever change is if I and a lot of like minded voters get out there and vote. I’m not waiting for the polls to say everyone else is ready, I just cast my vote and move on.
