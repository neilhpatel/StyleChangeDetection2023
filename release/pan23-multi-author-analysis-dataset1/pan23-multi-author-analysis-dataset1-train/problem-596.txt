\- UK in crisis - Thatcher's election and premiership is best understood in the context of the prolonged and severe economic crises of the 1970s. Serious union disputes, out of control inflation, complex unresolved problems with the European Common Market, Rhodesia, Northern Ireland and so on. The point being, Thatcher's election in 1979 was above all a response to this situation, and her radical shaking-up of decades of consensus was the primary lens through which she was seen, both then and now.
\- Thatcher as relatively little-known in 1979 - seeing as the question specifically asks about how she was viewed in 1979, it is worth remembering that the public perception of Thatcher was far less well defined then than it would become a decade later. Her win in the '75 leadership contest was a major surprise for a relatively obscure politician, and much attention was on struggles with in the Labour government, and between the government and the trade unions.
Thanks again. I am realizing I need to learn a lot more about British politics â€” the most I know about Harold Wilson is he raised taxes, and that's thanks to the Beatles of all people. I may not have time right now to say "I'll go check out Blake's book" and mean it literally, but I will when I can.
