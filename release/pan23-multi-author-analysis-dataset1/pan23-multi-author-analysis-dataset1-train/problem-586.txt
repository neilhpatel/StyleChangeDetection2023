You're guessing wrong. What Khanna "forgets" to mention is that there's a strict procedure for rule making and that any enforcement actions needs staff to process and investigate the cases. Both can take years, especially if you take public input to rules seriously and if the ratio between staff and complaints is as astronomical as it has been the last years. It would be up to lawmakers like Sanders and Khanna to both strenhen the authority of DOT and give them the budget to hire enough people.
Maybe those lawmakers shouting about him doing not enough should give him the budget to hire enough people to actually process complaints. If you have more than 10 times as many complaints but only 30% more staff it will take more time to finalize those fines. They seem to have made the process a lot more efficient giving the amount of refunds in the last batch of enforcement actions but there's a limit to what can be done by better organization.
What has happened? The Southwest issue was a few days ago and we donâ€™t know yet, whether they need to be fined for not honoring their obligations to refund. What is wring with you?
I mean as opposed to most of corporate media that calls Manchin a "moderate centrist" for raising taxes on 100 million working American families this year while keeping tax cuts for global corporations that benefit folks like the Saudi Royal family more than any actual Americans.
