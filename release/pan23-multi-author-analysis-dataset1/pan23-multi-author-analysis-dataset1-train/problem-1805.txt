Charlemagne lived long enough ago that he's an ancestor to something like a billion people, one way or another. There's a decent chance that you're a descendant of Charlemagne!
The UK was against a unified EU military when it was a member as well, because not everything is progress and a bunch of countries who have failed to show leadership militarily and have essentially delegated European security to the United States combining into one still results in a situation where countries are delegating responsibility to the United States.
Are you...... dense, bud? What does that change to the discussion in this context, which is about political leadership of a realm (France has factually existed as a political entity for over a 1000 years now and that's a historical consensus) or military prowess of a people (when did the French began to exist to you? After the concept of nation-states emerged following the French Revolution in the late 18th century and 19th century? The people before that were aliens and not our great great great great great great.... grandparents?).
