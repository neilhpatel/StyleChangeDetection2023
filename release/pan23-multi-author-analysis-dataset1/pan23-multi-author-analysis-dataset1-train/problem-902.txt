I’m Portuguese, living abroad for almost 10 years now. Every time I had to pay something to the tax office they said there’s no other way to pay unless through “payments to the state” on an ATM or via home banking with a Portuguese account. And I had the same problem 2 months ago when my father in law died and we had to pay inheritance tax.
Erdogan benefits. No matter what his public rethoric is or how much he condemns the act, Erdogan loves that Rasmus burned that book. It gave him the perfect excuse to further deny Sweden from NATO and ingratiate himself with the more radical Muslims of his core voting group which, let's be honest, is pretty much all of them. He might be mad and wagging his finger on the outside, but on the inside he is dancing a happy jig and thanking Rasmus.
Exactly. With just one act, both Turkey and Russia achieved their objective. Provide a flimsy reason for Erdogan to block Sweden into NATO while also providing the fundamentalist and nationalistic impetus that Erdogan needed in an election year when his economy is in doldrums.
