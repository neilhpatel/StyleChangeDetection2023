I mean, last I was in Russia, they celebrated Christmas on the 7th of January, as the orthodox church didnt adjust for the Julian calender, like the catholics back when….
Aktully! They've just had an online survey in Ukraine which has shown that about 60% of respondents are going to celebrate Christmas on 25th.
Also, bias doesn't discriminate between political affiliation. You'll find the same tricks being used by both Democrats and Republicans while accusing the other side of being the only one engaging in it. I have my own sympathies, but I always try to not be a hypocrite and build bridges. I wish everyone did that as well.
Congratulations. You’ve heard the correct counter argument to your position so many times that you’re accurately able to predict it’s arrival. Unfortunately you haven’t reached the point where you actually understand that argument. That or you’re arguing in bad faith and willfully refuse to understand the simple concept that a existential war of survival inevitably necessitates compromises to democracy. As evidenced by literally every democratic nation that’s ever been invaded.
