There were humans living in the region that is now the central Sahara approximately 7,000-10,000 years ago, and some settlements on the edge of the Sahara or in mountain ranges as recently as 2500-3500 years ago.
Within the past 100,000 years there have been numerous periods of climate variability in the Sahara region. The prevailing climate has switched from long periods of aridity and desertification, to wetter "pluvial" periods with much more rainfall and ecological change to grassland and numerous lakes and rivers^1, and back. That journal nature article says that the earliest period of desertification happened some 7 million years ago, but the region has not been uninterrupted desert for the last 7 million years, there have been many "wet" periods where it was relatively easy for humans to live there.
