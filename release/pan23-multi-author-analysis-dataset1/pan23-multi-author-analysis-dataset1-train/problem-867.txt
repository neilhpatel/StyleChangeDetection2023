Farmsteads and villas, however, got destroyed over time as subsistence farming replaced the industrial farming of Rome after the Roman occupation of Britain stopped under Constantine the third around 410. And since Roman building style required logistic lines that extended far into the mediterranean, there were very little resources to "rebuild" or "maintain" roman structures. Marble was not found in large quantities locally. Bathhouses (another very roman building) also relied on high-maintenance aquaducts to supply them. So these buildings fell in disuse and disrepair.
Also another question if you're happy to answer it, I live in Liverpool, England and there has never really been any signs of roman settlement here and I have tried researching if there was any roman settlements here but all I could find was that some roman coins and pottery were found a few years ago and that was pretty much it. Do you think there was any roman activity in that region of England (Merseyside mainly), like a roman camp, temple or something?
