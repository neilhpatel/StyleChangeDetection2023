I’m only saying this because I’ve heard many stories about this. But not all judges are the same, and you should do what you think is best for your child. Hire a lawyer immediately so you can go into the courtroom ready.
ETA that if I had to a file a motion like this, I would argue that my minor child was complaining of being forced to hear inordinately loud sexual activity between the other parent and partner, as well as being subjected to listen to and watch the other parent and partner speak and act obscenely sexual, as well as being threatened that she was not allowed to sleep in the privacy of her bedroom when she complained about how inappropriate the parent and partner are being, and that I am extremely concerned about the emotional health and wellbeing of my minor child as a result of the circumstances and environment. I would also specifically quote my daughter telling me that she does not feel safe in that house because of how her parent's partner looks at her while making sexual comments.
