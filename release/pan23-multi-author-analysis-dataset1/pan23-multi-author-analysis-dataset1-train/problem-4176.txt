Yawn. Yes, I'm quite aware that Garland refuses to take action and wants to remain apolitical. He appointed Smith, and yeah. Words were said, recommendations were made, reports were shared, brows were furrowed. Great, they imprisoned some fringe extremist group of the pride boys. The evidence is a mile high, and no one , not one rich political figure has or will have faced any real consequence. Past comments in r/politics? Is that a joke. Let's talk about how the Iran Contra shook out and ole Ronny the actor, magically couldn't remember a damn thing. BTW, where's the scapegoat Ollie now?

Being scientifically literate doesn’t make you immune to political extremism. It also doesn’t make you immune to narcissism and other personality disorders. I’m in STEM and I’ve met quite a few people who espouse all sorts of prejudices and extremist beliefs or who navigate social situations pathologically.
Yeah Hope! You should have seen that coming. You worked for a criminal enterprise that attempted to take our very government away and replace it with tyranny. You all saw the writing on the wall and did nothing. That’s just as bad as Donnie. Maybe you can turn states?
