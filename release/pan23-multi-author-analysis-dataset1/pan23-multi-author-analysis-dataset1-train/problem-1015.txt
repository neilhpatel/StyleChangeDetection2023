My 4th grade teacher once told my class while teaching us Texas history that Sam Houston developed gangrene in a wound on his leg and that it smelled so bad that his wife left him.

2. This mass depends on the mass of the limbs of the bow - a big heavy bow (like a longbow, or a Japanese yumi) needs heavy arrows to be efficient.
The Mongol bow gives much better long range performance, and the Japanese bow gives, for the same draw weight, significantly better anti-armour performance. Compared to a typical longbow, the Japanese bow has a much longer draw lenh, and a better force-draw curve, and similar efficiency - it will deliver better anti-armour performances for the same draw weight, and have similar range.
