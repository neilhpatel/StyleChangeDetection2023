Many automotive insurance policies transfer your coverage to a new vehicle for a month after you buy it to replace your previously-insured vehicle.
If you replace a covered vehicle on your policy with a different vehicle, most insurance policies will extend the coverage for your old car to the new vehicle for several weeks before requiring you to add that vehicle to your policy and re-calculate your premiums based on the value of the replacement car.
Thank you. You’re completely right in that the loan holder is charging me $800 based on me not being able to provide proof of insurance for the vehicle for one month (in which I believed the seller had procured it). I’m a bit confused on the first two sentences. I’m not very familiar with law, I only joined this subreddit a few months ago to learn more. Is there anything I can do here?
My guess is that your former vehicle insurance policy was either liability-only, or had limits too low to cover the value of your newly purchased car, and that's why the lender took action.
My guess is that you did not provide proof of insurance to the lender, so they "force placed" a very expensive policy on the car to protect their collateral from loss. Such insurance does not fulfill your obligation to have liability insurance, cover your liabilities if you cause a collision, or prevent you from getting a driving without proof of financial responsibility citation.
I appreciate that last paragraph a lot. I’ll make sure to be smarter in the future. I’m a kid. I wanted a cool car that I love, and didn’t look into it. Well, not enough. Thank you.
Getting a pre-purchase inspection, running a CarFax before buying, arranging your own financing, and verifying your insurance carefully are all things you should do, but that an auto dealer is not obligated to guide you through doing.
