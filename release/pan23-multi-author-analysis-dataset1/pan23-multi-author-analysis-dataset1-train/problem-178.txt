I vote in Georgia and it’s 7-7 Monday thru Friday for the runoff for early voting. I have never waited over 15 mins in early voting lines in many election cycles of voting. Opening it up on Saturdays is nice as well but it really isn’t changing people’s opportunity to vote. I’ve worked the elections, multiple family members are election precinct managers. We never saw extra numbers with weekend voting that correlated with turnout but it’s nice there is more options for people to make it work with their schedule. It’s really just adding another day for the election workers but I don’t disagree with more hours. Just don’t really see it as a big deal one way or another. We can vote in GA very easily, and doesn’t take much time at all out of your day, in early voting as is. It’s really simple to get a mail in ballot too if you know you won’t be able to go in person. The same people will inevitably vote that would’ve, but hopefully it makes it easier.
