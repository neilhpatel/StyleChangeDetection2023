Free? Nation wide, average tax payer pays about $3500 a year to fund public education. If you live to 80 you’ll end up paying around AN ADDITIONAL $200,000 for your “free” higher learning education. Whether you want it or not.

Education is extremely important to be successful IMO, but I'm convinced the American college system isn't actually about educating individuals, its about gating access to the modern economy.
Yes. But the us is also kinda unique in its high schools system. A lot of Europe like the Uk Germany France and Italy track students really hard. Not sure about current state Germany but an 8th grade education in the early 2000’s was considered good enough. You have to compete for a high school spot and that’s got problems all on it’s own.
