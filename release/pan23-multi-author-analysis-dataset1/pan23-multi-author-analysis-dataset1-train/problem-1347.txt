the quilted linen test armours similarly provided significant (but not complete) protection against arrows with energies of up to 70J. The quilted armours tested were relatively thin, 15 layers compared to the 30 layers historically described as required for good protection against arrows. Extrapolating these results to 30 layers, arrows from high draw weight war bows should be stopped. The test results in.
Other fighters would have carried shields as they were both cheap (or cheaper) than additional pieces of armour (whenever you were supplied with or provided your own) and very useful at doing a very simple thing: stopping missile fire (mainly). Not carrying a shield with you on a battlefiled, aside from the aforementioned ranged combatants, would have been feasible if either you were not facing something a shield could protect you from (picture late XVI, early XVII century pikemen relying solely on their armour as no shield could ever stop a bullet from a firearm of the era), or if your armour could protect you from said missiles (knights and men-at-arms of the XV and XVI centuries - and to some extent the XVII - would stop carrying shields as full plate harnesses were effective at stopping arquebus and musket rounds, also being nigh impenetrable to other kinds of ranged projectiles, using the free hand to wield two handed pole weapons).
were similar. Notably, doubling the thickness of the layered linen improved the protection by 2.5 times.
