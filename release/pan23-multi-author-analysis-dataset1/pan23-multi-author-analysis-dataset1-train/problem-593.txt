That's before even having to clean this trash up. Price for Arizona to clean-up Sheriff Arpaio's legal mess over 6 terms was $100 million. Just these two things combined will probably cost Arizona's taxpayers about a quarter of a billion dollars paying for "fiscally conservative" Republican stunts to own the libs.

The visible adaptation of narcissistic collapse? Everybody is interested in why a person in a position of power would act so incoherently and waste their constituents tax dollars on a borderline (no pun intended) ineffective publicity stunt.
95 million??? What the hell - I'm surprised Arizona taxpayers arent bugging the fuck out. Lowkey the storage containers should actually make it easier because now they have a spot out of the sun they can just cut into with a sawzall/battery/2 fresh metal blades. Surprised they didnt do infrared cameras on high poles that can be sent to an app as an alert.
