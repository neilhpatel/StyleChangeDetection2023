“I have, and despite being the healthiest, most physically fit and mentally stable president ever, more than Lincoln, more than Washinon, but I have the worst heels. We didn’t want to disclose that unlike Sleepy Joe, guy can’t even stay awake I mean it’s like ‘come on, wake up Joe’ But anyway the doctor felt bad telling me this because I’m so healthy and strong and he held my very large hands, and told me ‘Donald, I don’t know how you’ve managed your whole life with these, there’s so many spurs, I thought it was San Antonio, or even the 1800’s’ he said, he just couldn’t believe that I had made it this far with the worst heels he’s ever seen, worse than Achilles, possibly the worst heels of all time. But I told him, I said “what about Hillary’s emails, you know you should look into that, do your research, they should lock her up” And anyway, any time I felt my heels hurt, I just thought about it and despurred them and went about my day.”.
Unlikely. The argument that they’ll make is the witch-hunt led to his health rapidly deteriorating. Science be damned, the law and politics doesn’t follow science or logic.
Strongest septuagenarian ever. He's like a bull. Truly, no other president could handle a federal prison like Donald J Trump All the others are wusses by comparison. Go Brandon 🥴.
