I think our issue here may be evidence? We have documented the damages (photos of the black soot outlines left by charred surge protectors, similar blackening damage to outlets at the wall, videos of devices glitching heavily) but because of her offer to break lease, we went that route (thinking, naively, that it would be straightforward) instead of arranging for any electrical inspection report (which she made clear would be at our own cost).
Based on the agreement you said she made, yes. And correct. California also requires the landlord return the deposit within 21 days with an itemized list of deductions. If the landlord doesn't you can sue for your the return of your entire deposit (not just the deposit minus the deductions), plus the court can potentially award you an additional amount equal to twice the deposit for not adhering to the law. In other words, if your deposit is $2,000 and the landlord doesn't return the portion due and an itemized list of deductions you can sue for $6,000 in small claims court.
Thanks! We were wise enough to only lose a few surge protectors and a hair dryer, but not the computers and TVs they were connected to, so I won't cry over that as long as we can get out without too much more headache...
