Probate stuff is one of the bar topics. Your attorney will probably be able to give you some good advice, or at least point you in the right direction. I'm in a trusts and estates class right now, but I have no idea why they would be asking that. It seems like they aren't really involved in the probate so they would have no ground to ask that. But I'm not sure.
"Most every defendant (and their insurers) will require Letters Testamentary (also known as Letters of Administration etc.) prior to the funding of any settlements. The Letters need to be signed by the judge for the probate court.".
Okay. Thanks. I guess what was confusing me was that in my state, you need to open an estate only if there are assets in the sole name of the deceased. I assume then that the settlement monies will be in my father's name and those are aforementioned assets that will exist, even though they didn't at the time of his death. It just seems odd since we are in the lawsuit as 'surviving heirs'. And, I wish the lawyer had told us to do this earlier. Like last year.
