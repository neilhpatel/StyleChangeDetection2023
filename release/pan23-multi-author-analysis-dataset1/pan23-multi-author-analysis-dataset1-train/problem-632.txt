It’s more about incentivizing dog owners to make sure their dogs aren’t aggressive. As a commenter mentioned above, dogs jumping against a fence and/or at something isn’t a good thing, and can and should be trained out. You simply can’t watch a dog 24/7, and you need to ensure that they can be trusted in any situation. I happen to live in the same state as the OP, and now that this dog has bitten a person, its owner is aware that the dog has “dangerous propensities,” and if it bites again- under any circumstances- the owner is open to a whole host of liability.
Just to note. If you’re neighbor is doing this they may have done it innocently or purposefully. With that in mind they are more prone to do it again if there is some monetary gain to them. I’d get cameras installed anywhere the dogs can get to behind your fence. This will ensure if another incident happens you have proof of what really happened. I’d also look at some extra dog training. Dogs jumping against/on a fence at anything is a bad habit and should be trained out and not encouraged.
