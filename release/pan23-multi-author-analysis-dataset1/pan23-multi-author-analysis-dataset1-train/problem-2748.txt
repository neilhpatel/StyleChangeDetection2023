You have not provided enough information for a definitive decision to be made. Someone would have to look at the actual language in the will or in the trust document to see what the requirements/instructions are. Did the beneficiaries ask for a copy of the trust and were they given accounting reports annually about the trust? The fact that disbursements were given after the age of 25 does NOT indicate that there was a breach of fiduciary duties--it's actually a benefit for the beneficiaries to have received additional income, but the beneficiaries should have been given everything they were entitled to at age 25 and then the trust should have been dissolved, but maybe the trustee was not fully aware about that aspect.
Thanks man. From what you have said to what my lawyer friend said ( he’s a real estate guy) their would be some significant legal battles ahead and not worth the headache. Maybe a strongly worded phone call on how her actions made me feel would be more impactful. The final accounting is being done as the last grandchild has turned 25 and their is 125k leftover to be split between us beneficiaries. ( after accounting ring and legal costs mind you) soooo after all said and done it seems crazy that much money paid for about 7 kids college and the rest of us might get a grand. Trusts… I would never do this to my kids but will give them money when I’m alive and able to see them enjoy and not squabble.
