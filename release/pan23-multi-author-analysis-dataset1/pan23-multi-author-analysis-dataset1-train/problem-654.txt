The concept you're interested in has a pretty specific origin. It dates to an incident that occurred over Washinon State on 24 June 1947. Kenneth Arnold, an Idaho man who owned his own fire control equipment business, was flying his light plane over Mount Rainier when his attention was drawn to a series of flashes in the sky. Looking more closely, he noticed a diagonal formation of nine bright objects jinking between the peaks ahead of him at an incredible speed. One was crescent-shaped, but – at least as Arnold later recalled it – the other eight were objects that he would draw as having "a curved front third, straight edges, and a rear edge that came to a rounded point." While they did not seem to be disc-shaped, however, they appeared to move, in Arnold’s telling phrase, "like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water.".
Excellently presented argument with sound supporting material. I found this however, I believe it has been peer reviewed. Apparently there is some evidence of saucers being depicted in different regions as far back as 30k BCE. Whether or not they are real is a different question but saucers appear to have been with us in the human psyche for a long time, for whatever reason.
