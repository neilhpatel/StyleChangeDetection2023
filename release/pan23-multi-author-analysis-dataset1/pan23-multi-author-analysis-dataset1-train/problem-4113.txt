Take to a tenant lawyer. Other then doing as your lease states to break the lease (because it sounds like they canâ€™t follow basic laws or care) you are probably going to have to get lawyers involved and sue. But please be aware that it may not be worth it and the lawyer may not take the case. Recommend emails so you can keep a paper trail and any time you find maintenance in your apartment without you letting them in call the cops. Also get a camera.
Do you think if we sent a formal email requesting a 60-day notice without penalties due to violations of the lease and Florida statute 83.53 and explaining everything - with a reference of how we tried to talk to the office about it on 06/27, a copy of the email we sent on 06/27 that had an attachment of the lease and said to not enter when nobody is home without a written notice of at least 12 hours again, the pictures of everything being moved on 06/27, ask them to look at the records they have of a maintenance order being fulfilled when noone was home without a written notice on 9/2, and attach the police report with a receipt of the item, it would be enough to ask them to break the lease without penalty? Could they still reject that? I feel like that's gotta be some proof or that the burden of proof should be on them bc they're the ones that came in without a written notice or a 12 hour notice, like the lease says. I wanna leave without waiting around until it happens again or wasting lots of money with a lawyer.
