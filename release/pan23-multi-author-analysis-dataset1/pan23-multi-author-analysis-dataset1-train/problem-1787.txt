In the end, if you cannot accommodate, then you can't. Can always do a trial & if it doesn't work out, give notice. I would accommodate say...a breastfeeding mom to stop in on lunch break, but if it caused chaos & confusion, I would dissallow due to disruption. So mom or someone mom appoints could stop in to do the noon ube feed if it was something you can't to. But I would rather expect the parent to do the AM tube feed, just like I would expect them to give AM meds or a baby their am bottle before dropping them off into my care. Hugs & good luck!
I will say that the home care situation in Massachusetts is super fucking rough right now, but I would definitely suggest that OP let them know that he or she cannot accommodate this request and ask them to work with their doctor to find an alternative feeding schedule so the baby gets more calories but can still attend daycare.
Yup! I only pointed that out because here in Washinon state, the ratio drops to the youngest child. 1-11 months is 1:4. 11-30 months is 1:7. Reading ‘infant’ and assuming they’re in the 1-11month range. I do not know if your laws are similar and just want to make sure you are legally covered on that end.
