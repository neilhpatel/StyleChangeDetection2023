I want the evil schools they describe. Religion is not treated as facts, people treat others with respect, kids are taught to question the establishment, kids are taught racism and other isms exist, LGTBQ kids feel comfortable, teachers teaching actual science and history, kids taught to read to expand their mind, oh the horrors of it.
So let me get this straight. Donald Trump, the guy who dyes his hair urine yellow in order to hide the fact that his hair has gone snow white, the guy who sports an obvious comb over in order to hide the scars from botched hair plug surgery, and the guy who uses orange makeup in order to cover up his pale, pasty skin complexion, suddenly has a problem with kids learning from teachers with pink-dyed hair.
I also do believe in Jesus’s teaching. Boil the Bible just to his lessons, and they are sound beliefs to hold. Damn the rich, don’t let religious figures control you by falsely representing god, be willing to forgive vs seek revenge, all humans deserve respect, we should take care of our weak, together we can make miracles happen, and we are equals in the eyes of god. All good lessons to live by in my eyes.
Sorry I meant the beer parlor speeches and the origins of NAZI propaganda leading to the rise of Hitler as chancellor years afterwards and the immediate rounding up of gays, handicapped and political dissidents.
