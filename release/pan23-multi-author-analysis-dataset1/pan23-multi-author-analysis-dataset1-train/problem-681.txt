Great. There’s about 25 people in Wyoming. O don’t think anyone outside of Wyoming cares about what they do in Wyoming. That’s why people go there. To get lost….
Really? Both of our "good" cars are over a decade old, and although we've had problems, computer components going bad all the time (or any time) has not been one. Our other vehicle is older than me, and I spend far more time fucking with the carb and points and plugs and so on, but even I figure a year into a zombie apocalypse, usable gasoline is going to be impossible to find, and distilling alcohol fuel probably assumes an infrastructure base that won't be available. Perhaps likewise for bio-diesel. Not that I spend much time thinking about it, LOL.
