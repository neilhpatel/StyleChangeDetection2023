But the short answer is that by the Ming dynasty, China didn't really have a noble class at all in the same way that Europe did in the sense of having a hereditary aristocracy that held formal titles that were linked to both land ownership and martial obligations.
China had something vaguely analogous during the Zhou dynasty and Warring States period, but they had begun to decline in relative importance to what you might call non-noble gentry (i.e. landowners without formal titles) as early as the Han dynasty (202 BCE - 220 CE). By the Song dynasty (960-1279), formal titles had been almost completely decoupled from any sort of meaningful privileges or obligations, which in turn fed a sort of title inflation as Song emperors could freely give out symbolic titles without having to accompany them with land grants or other economic privileges.
This is such a good answer! If I could ask, I’d be intrigued to know your opinion on Pomeranz’s book. In my second year of undergrad study I wrote an essay on how I felt he’d decided his conclusion and organised research to support it, but of course I’d love your thoughts.
