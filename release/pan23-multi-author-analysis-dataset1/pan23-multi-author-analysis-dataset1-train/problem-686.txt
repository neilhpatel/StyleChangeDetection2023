I own guns, I enjoy them; but as someone who’s seen enough families torn apart by gun violence, litigated the cases, and even treated the wounds in an earlier line of work, I can certainly recognize that there is room to adjust legislation and there are plenty of models that satisfy even one’s wildest self-defense hypotheticals even if some moderate restrictions on the rifles and large magazines that are so often used in these heinous massacres were imposed.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The political right in this country has a whole slew of major, existential failings right now- but I suspect that guns are going to have similar point of reckoning the same way that opioids did; the question is just how long it’ll be before the more regressive segments of society realize that there’s more to life than their Rambo fantasies. How many more thousands of innocent people will die before that happens is anyone’s guess.
