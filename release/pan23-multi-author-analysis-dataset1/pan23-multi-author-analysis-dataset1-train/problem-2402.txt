The most vivid way to answer your question would be to look at the skeletons found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, which tell us what hundreds of Romans were carrying with them when they died: coins, jewelry, charms, and even (in the case of children) toys. These people, however, were fleeing for their lives, and can't really be taken as a representative sample. It might be better to focus on Roman authors like Martial, who occasionally mention the things people carried, though often in a satirical (and thus misleading) context. Roman pedestrians often kept coins - perhaps a few brass sesterces and the smaller denominations - in a leather bag hung around their neck or suspended from their girdle. They often wore amulets or other charms. They might carry toothpicks, or dice, or their tokens for the grain dole. And if they were rich, they might be followed by a slave, who could be compelled to carry anything from the day's shopping to his mistress' mirror.
Incredibly underrated view. Well, underrated, at least, when compared to the most popular way of looking at these ancient civilizations, portrayed by the media. Have been deep diving into some Roman history since the pandemic hit and was genuinely surprised at how much of their history is still very much unknown to us. Or how much of what we think we know, is often more a product of conjecture and educated guessing than anything else.
My favorites are probably the Capitoline Museum in Rome, the Naples Archaeological Museum, and the Istanbul Archaeology Museums.
