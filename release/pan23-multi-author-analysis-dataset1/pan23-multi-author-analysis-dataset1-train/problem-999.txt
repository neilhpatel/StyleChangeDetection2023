Now since you brought up a value of $16 000 we're out of small claims and into higher civil Court so then we have stricter guidelines on what the judge will consider in the scope, unless one party specifically entered the existence of the landscaping service provided and it's value and it was determined to be relevant to the other issue it's a no go(maybe it's part of the response to the complainy about the home theatre, or a counter claim).
This is why you don't buy joint stuff with someone else. In the future dont do it. All it does is cause problems. And if you DO do this again, have a signed agreement of what will happen if a roommate moves out early (say... the goods stay in the unit and the roommate who is staying will pay the roommate who is leaving back their share) and when the roommate relationship is terminated. Protects both of you and gives a guideline for how shit is to be handled.
