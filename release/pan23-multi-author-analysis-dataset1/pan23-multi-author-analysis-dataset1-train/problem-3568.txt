I have a fam full of nurses and wayyyy to much experience being a patient. Get an advocate. I know it's covid and guests are limited but you need someone to speak for you. Asap. Preferably a family member but a close friend is good too. Write down exactly what you want done and give the advocate access (at least partially) to your medical info. Unfortunately, there are some shit docs/nurses out there that just fo not give a singular frick. (So many horror stories that thankfully didn't end tragically only because my mom is amazing) Having an advocate to double check what's being done and to make sure your wishes are listened to is imperative. Especially when you're Ill to the point if being medicated/unable to talk for yourself. Or are a woman/person of color/ have grey hair/are disabled/etc. Always have someone with you (this goes for pretty much every kind of Dr visit excluding well checks and pap smears. And even then having someone with you is supremely helpful. They remember stuff you wanted to mention or that the doc said etc) im sorry that you're going through this and I hope you're feeling betterish soon. Lots of hugs.
I already did that; it was unnecessary to post the long-form recounting here, especially since being rude or verbally abusive (generally) isn't illegal - but lying about medication and patient requests in order to circumvent consent is illegal, and the consent issue is the one that I am most concerned about, as well as being made to stay under the care of a nurse who committed that act after reporting it.
I would say even the first pap smear needs someone. Another person awhile ago didn’t realize her OBGYN was doing wayyyy more than he needed to during her pap smears. He was her first OBGYN so she didn’t know better.
