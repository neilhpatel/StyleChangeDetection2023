They were also (allegedly) on their way to commit major warcrimes against the US West coast when they got word of the surrender of Japan and (allegedly) dumped all their planes (allegedly) painted like US planes and (alleged) chemical weapon payloads overboard.
No. Being assigned to that floating POS is actually a punishment. The thing hasn’t worked since they stole from Ukraine on the same day they were voting for independence from the Soviet Union. Construction wasn’t even totally finished and they removed it from the only dock capable of finishing it. Tons of shit didn’t work from day one. Crew of 2000 or something and they have about a half hour a day in total of fresh water use for all those sailors at the same time. It’s been dead at sea nearly evertime it leaves port, due to boiler issues. No one with any ability wants to be on that hell hole. It’s not an actual useful vessel- it’s all show. They can’t really even operate aircraft off it due to many other issues. It’s not seen as strategically valuable - good sailors are assign more useful equipment.
Edit-leaving it...sigh. I don't know how that even happened. I don't think I have ever in my life written the word seminary. Cemetery, on the other hand... sadly too many times.
