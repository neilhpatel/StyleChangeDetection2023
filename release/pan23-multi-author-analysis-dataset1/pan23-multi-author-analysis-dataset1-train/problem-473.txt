While it's true that the Basin of Mexico in the Postclassic, somewhat conspicuously, had a dearth of permanent walled cities, defensive fortification and settlement in defensible patterns are common throughout many parts and times in Mesoamerica. These were not always walls (though sometimes they were!), but could be settling on high ground in addition to structures like moats and forts. Most often these settlement patterns are associated with periods of turmoil or endemic warfare. The Maya region, for instance, was often fraught with conflict between rival polities. As a result, defensive architecture is found across the Maya area, from the Guatemalan Highlands (Borgstede & Mathieu, 2007), to the Peten (Demarest et al. 1997), to the Yucatan (Russel, 2013).
Warfare among Southern Coast Salishan groups tended to be fairly subdued in comparison to Northern and Central Salishans, though that isn't to say that it didn't include the occasional non-Salishan incursion into the Sound or intertribal warfare among them where tribes maintained consistent alliances. Foreign foes found themselves dealing against anybody they came across, even occasionally working together with the implicit understanding that foreigners had little interest in distinguishing local tribes from one another.

Sorry if that's not all accurate. I'm genuinely curious if modern historians don't think that Western Europeans developed rights, ideas, and freedoms that led to its success.
