The situation is far worse than most people realise. Tbh I don't see any realistic way off the path to total collapse short of a global revolt against business as usual environmental destruction. But given the vice-like grip that the corporate/billionaire media has over people's attitudes and that corporations/billionaires have over most of the political class, that seems like a fantasy at this point.
Whoops. Well there yah go. Works of art and expression are okay so long as there is no lasting damage, but threaten refineries and you're getting in the way of big, big money. Now that they cannot tolerate.
Complete fantasy. The planet will not be "uninhabtable", and there is no singular, arbitrary "point of no return". Acting faster is better than acting slower, yes, but we're not "doomed".
Laws don't track morality automatically . That's why we change them all the time. And they often stay wrong for a very long time.
Strawman argument. Public spaces, other people's property, travel hubs and oil supply lines are not YOUR house. They are other people's proverbial houses, and climate terrorists don't get to dictate what people do there.
