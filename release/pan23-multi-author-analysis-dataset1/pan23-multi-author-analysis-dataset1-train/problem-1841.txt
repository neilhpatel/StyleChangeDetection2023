The Inkai Uranium project spans about 486km2 where a hole is drilled every 25-50m and millions of tonnes of sulfuric acid is poured into the ground. Other activity is exluded from an area in a 15km radius or around 1000km2 due to the ground water contamination. It devastates nature on a scale only comparable to coal mining.

PV solar is no less safe and it's significantly cheaper at utility scale, I'd say it's probably not as clean due to material but it also doesn't take 10+ years to get an installation operational.
The EPR project in France. 15+y in the making, still not operating. The budget has exploded 3 times the original budget. The price per kWh will be between 2-3 times more of new solar PV. Not included of course are the insane costs of building the plants back and taking care of the nuclear waste for thousands of years. Nevermind that there literally is no business case for nuclear energy cause it is so freaking cost inefficient that the only way to make a profit with it is to make taxpayers pay for all the costs and externalities for you "bUt iT iS tHe cHeApEsT enErgY eVEr".
Not to mention that the costs of nuclear do not even include the giant costs that are yet to come when all the reactors have to be build back and the waste has to be cared for literally thousands of years.
