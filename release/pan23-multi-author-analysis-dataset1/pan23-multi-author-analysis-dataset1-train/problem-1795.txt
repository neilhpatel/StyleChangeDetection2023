> More than half the respondents to the American organisationâ€™s survey did not know six million Jews were murdered and 29% believe the death toll was below two million.
Easily. "The education system" isn't really a single system. There are just over 17,000 public school districts in the US, and that's not counting the private schools. All of these are pretty independent. There are efforts at the state and national level to standardize things, but a lot of that consists of nudges rather than outright dictating what must be taught and how the school must be administrated.
Not necessarily. What made me think that the holocaust was exaggerated was how it was taught in school. it was shoved down our throats how evil it was but very little was properly explained and very little context was provided. As a kid I just assumed that if someone is that insistent on pushing a specific narrative it must be because they are at least partially lying. But I never doubted that it had happened and always thought that it was evil, due to there being too much evidence for it to be made up. And any genocide is obviously horrible.
Political decisions. The same kind of decisions why quite some Nazis went unpunished or ended up with laughable low punishments and later mysteriously turned up in and worked for the US for example (Operation Paperclip) or were part of newly formed post-war government institutions like the Gehlen organization in Germany later.
So when a school is crap, that's the responsibility of the folks who live in that area. The folks who live in that area tend not to care because that's how the school became crap in the first place!
