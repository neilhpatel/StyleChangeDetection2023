-This is great. This means that a provider ordered labs and is following them. This is how they will monitor your step father even though he’s not in a room.
I’m not calling you a liar, I would just be very surprised if they told you he was “non-emergent.” In field triage for disaster management, the categories are black/expectant (this person is likely to die no matter what we do given our available resources), red/emergent (this person will die without immediate attention, but can be saved given our resources), yellow/urgent (this person needs attention, but will survive for some time without immediate intervention), and green/non-urgent (minor injuries).
I hope your step father recovers well. Diabetic keto acidosis is very serious. Legally, there would have to be damages and the medical team would have to be operating outside the standard of care. Without knowing his vital signs and what exactly was done when, this is impossible for any of us to say. Waiting many hours is not a deviation from the standard of care, it’s just a sad reality of emergency care today. In terms of the security guards, they wouldn’t be involved in malpractice obviously, but it wouldn’t be their role to chase after patients leaving the hospital unless asked to help. They are there to protect patients and staff from possible harms, which does include belligerent family members.
