In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Seriously. We’re a really large diverse state and DeSantis narrowly won the first election. Since then, he’s deliberately dissected blue districts, stacked elected and non-elected positions with boot lickers, removed people from elected positions that he doesn’t like, plus issued standing invitations to every conservative in the country to come here and stack the decks even more. Every time voters pass progressive legislation, our legislature guts it.
