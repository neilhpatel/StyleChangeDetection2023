To be brief, it was because these two states were the only ones that had been "reconstructed". Well, not quite. Let me explain.
Whether or not the radicals in Congress would have accepted the representatives of those newly organized governments and seated them is an open question, and indeed history shows that they indeed rejected the unreconstructed representatives sent back to Congress by the white only governments from the South in 1865 and 1866 who basically didn't bother with even lip service loyalty to the Union. (Incidentally, had Congress not kept them out, the 14th Amendment would have never passed either; it actually took the temporary expelling of a Democratic New Jersey Senator over a fairly petty election dispute - he'd come to office via a plurality rather than a majority - to get it through.).
After military victory at Gettysburg and Vicksburg seemed to secure eventual victory, and with large parts of the Confederacy firmly under Union control, Lincoln turned towards the work of Reconstruction in earnest. He started with what is known as the 10% plan, which basically allowed Southerners to renounce their allegiance to the Confederacy and take an oath to uphold the Union and its laws. From McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: "Whenever the number of persons in any state taking the oath reached 10 percent of the number of voters in i860, this loyal nucleus could form a state government which would be recognized by the president. To Congress, of course, belonged the right to decide whether to seat the senators and representatives elected from such states.".
But here's the other aspect to this: what many historians tend to forget about Congress during that time period is that excepting special sessions called by the President to confirm executive nominees after the change of administrations, the vast majority of 19th Century Congresses didn't actually sit in session until December of the year following the election.
