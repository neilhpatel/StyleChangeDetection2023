We can’t predict how his wife’s challenge to the estate may play out in these circumstances. It sounds like there may be some risk from that angle. In general you need not do (and probably should not do) anything not specified in dad’s will. If she files a pleading in probate court you obviously need an attorney and should then follow the advice of that attorney. A cautious person would consult that probate attorney now.
Regarding survivor's benefits. OP's mother may be entitled to these vs current wife who was only married to him for 5 years. This happened wtih my friend when her husband of 8 years suddenly passed.
Understood. And that’s a fantastic reason to go to the probate attorney now. Involving a lawyer both takes the burden largely off of you, and tends to push things into a resolution phase where unreasonable or unrealistic demands fade back.
