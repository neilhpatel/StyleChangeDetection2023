I doubt much attention will be put on Biden, since he and his team are fully cooperating. But there are multiple systemic failures that must be addressed: intelligence agencies and NARA didn't know there were copies of classified documents gone astray, so existing rules and procedures are not working as intended.
I’m OK with it too, for a few reasons. If Biden didn’t demonstrate malfeasance and it was a case of documents being misplaced, an investigation will bear that out. It also helps his case that his team called NARA immediately upon finding them, which is what you’re supposed to do.

Also this appointment of another special counsel neuters the Republican line of attack that Garland is targeting Trump and Jack Smith’s investigation is a political hit, and all but ensures that if Biden is going to be charged with anything then so will Trump, whose conduct around classified documents is more criminally and morally dubious in every measurable way. With far fewer documents in question and no attempts shown to obstruct justice, Biden can be confident he’ll come out looking better if he just rides the wave and lets DOJ work.
