In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I'm glad. My property has a small but thriving forested wetland that serves as the keystone of my local ecosystem. I hope this rule protects it from being developed/drained by future owners.
Environmental scientist here! If it's any reassurance, water is pretty rigorously monitored in this country. The EPA and state/municipal agencies all test water quality indicators and pollutant concentrations regularly, and the results should be publicly available through the websites of those agencies.
We also have federally and state mandated water quality monitoring programs at known polluted sites. If you look at all the EPA National Priorities List (Superfund) locations, a part of the legal process involves studying the sites to establish baseline water quality, and then periodically testing during and after remedial actions are taken to make sure those actions actually keep the water clean. We usually do similar monitoring/testing for sediment, soils, vegetation, and animal tissue.
And companies will seek to sue over the new ruling. Elevating it to the supreme court, who will inevitably dismantle the EPA.

Generally, municipal drinking water and wastewater plant influent/effluent are tested for various contaminants regularly throughout the year, and held to specific standards. The big problem is making corporations take action if their industrial discharges cause water to fail standards.
