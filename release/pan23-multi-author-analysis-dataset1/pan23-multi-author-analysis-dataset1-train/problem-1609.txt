We are having the same problem with Chinese owned developers buying up huge chunks of land and putting up as many houses as possible. Source: me. I work for a consulting firm in the DC area and these are most of our clients. The get away with by being only %49 owned by Chinese investors and having a bunch of these type of companies.
Absolutely. You should be a permanent resident or citizen to buy real estate in the USA. I don’t think investment companies foreign or even American should be competing to buy up single family housing units in any market in the USA.
That is good. I read that part. And I am glad that Canada offers a path to residency for people who do want to live there. It's still too broad (excludes non-immigrant aliens) and ineffective in that foreign investors are one factor (one could even say a minor factor) in driving up home prices who could have just been regulated.
"...experts have also said the ban on foreign buyers — who accounted for less than 5% of home ownership in Canada, according to the national statistical agency — would not have the desired effect of making homes more affordable...".
THANK YOU. So many people here who would rather blame foreigners and investment firms than governments for artificially reducing supply and NIMBYs for opposing densification. This is such NIMBY shit.
