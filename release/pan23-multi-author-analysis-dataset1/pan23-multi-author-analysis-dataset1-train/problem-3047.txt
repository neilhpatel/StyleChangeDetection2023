And if someone catches on - float that shit over populated areas straight out to the ocean. Evidence gone. A topographical map of the ocean floor will show you exactly why China sent the balloon into wind currents headed that direction. They were certainly trying to make sure the payload ended up in deep waters where recovery would be most difficult.
Cost, maneuvering, and optical resolution. Satellites are expensive and have predictable orbits - you can just hide your assets at the right time. Optical resolution is limited by diffraction and atmospheric disturbance. Balloons can adjust altitude to hit air currents as a crude steering mechanism.
Plausible deniability. The potential ability to jettison the payload in the ocean if you're found out (or from anywhere and hope it doesn't survive the 60,000ft fall).
The instinctual prioritization of direct experience is an evolutionary problem. We have to fight our need to prefer a single data point (our own) vs a statistical truth. Notice how people prefer antivax anecdotes instead of the data from billions of prior shots.
