How can UK quarrel with France if Germany destroys France? I mean, it's common knowledge France needs to exist to quarrel with France. It's in UK's best interest to keep France alive so they can continue to quarrel.
Petition to officially rename “imperial system of measurements” to “monosyllabic system of measurements”. It’s 2022, we have no need for monarchs and emperors.

Industrialization and manufacturing still win wars. It’s exactly what we saw with SpaceX and the Boeing/Lockheed partnership. For decades we operated under the assumption that space was fundamentally hard and that we needed these bloated contracts to operate. Then Elon Musk and SpaceX came around and absolutely crushed the old school players in the market. Every other space company is obsolete because of what Falcon 9 can do in terms of cost and reliability. Even the next generation vehicles like SLS are basically dead on arrival due to program costs. It’s absolutely insane the stagnation that industry caused in the space business.
