The transition of Tokugawa ambition from attaining power to maintaining it led to a number of stability-focused policies, including both what we now call sakoku and the outlawing of Christianity. This immediately put the new bakufu at odds with the Jesuits, and after the Shimabara Rebellion was put down (with the aid of guns and gunpowder from the Protestant Dutch at Hirado) the shogunate had finally had enough and expelled the Portuguese from Dejima, moving the Dutch there from Hirado shortly after.
2. The Tokugawa came to power at the tail end of the Ikkō-ikki Buddhist movement which had preached resistance against daimyō and traditional structures of authority. Rebel bands caused great amounts of destruction however Oda Nobunaga led a vicious, though successful campaign against them. Christianity faced immediate suspicion from the outset as the Shogunate had just put down one new religious movement preaching against authority and then Christianity arrived stating that followers had to place loyalty to a foreign bishop over that of the rulers of Japan. This all meant that Christianity would not have an easy time proving itself to be unsubversive to Tokugawa rule.
