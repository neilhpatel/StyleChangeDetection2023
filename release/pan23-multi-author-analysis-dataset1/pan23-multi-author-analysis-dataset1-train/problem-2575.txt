>Belarus's National Assembly approved in two readings on December 14 a bill that allows authorities to strip citizenship from anyone, including native Belarusians, for extremism. The current law allows only naturalized citizens to be deprived of their citizenship if convicted of extremist activities. Authorities have labeled numerous independent media outlets, NGOs, journalists, and bloggers as extremists in the wake of mass protests that gripped the country following an August 2020 presidential vote that handed the authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka a sixth term in office despite opposition claims the election was rigged.
Oh, Jesus that’s horrifying. Anywhere you look right now pretty much shit is not good and people are suffering and being threatened for wanting freedom. Not to minimize the personal experience of the Belarusians and what’s happening to them because they have it worse than most countries but it’s infecting every part of the globe and today Belarus seems like a place where this kind of things happens and far from places like the US, Canada and western Europe and the truth is right wing extremism is hovering over us, waiting for the moment it can seize any power to make our lives as miserable as possible. They aren’t implementing anything in Belarus that they aren’t telling us all everyday they can’t wait to do in many democratic countries all over.
