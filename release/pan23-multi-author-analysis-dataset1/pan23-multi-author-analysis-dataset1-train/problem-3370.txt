There were some brief thoughts that the bomb might ignite a fusion reaction in the atmosphere (nothing to do with lightning). This was fairly early in the project. The same people who thought this idea up also figured out that it wouldn't happen. The idea was floated to a few people higher up in the project, and one of them, Arthur Compton, was indeed of the opinion that if there was any plausible chance of that happening, then they shouldn't proceed. But there wasn't any real plausible chance of it happening.
Measurements of neutron-induced reactions are a totally different beast than "normal" charged-particle-induced nuclear reactions. Hydrodynamics and shock physics of high-explosive-driven implosions is different than air flowing over a wing to generate lift.
Sure. Of course, the group leaders tended to have experience in what they were working on, and could help direct the others. They also held large talks, open to all with a clearance to work in the technical area, to share their work, their techniques, their ideas, etc., with the aim of promoting cohesiveness.
