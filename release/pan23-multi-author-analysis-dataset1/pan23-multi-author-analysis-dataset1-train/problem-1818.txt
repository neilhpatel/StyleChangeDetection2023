I think this question can best be answered with the help of an example. Here I'll provide an example of one of the biggest military failures in Indian military history, namely the Third Battle of Panipat, 14th of January, 1761.
Incredibly interesting! It's fascinating to me to see the components of a such disasters. Thank you very much for taking your time to explain this, and with sources no less.
Yet, Balaji Vishwanath, not only served to bring the Maratha cause incredible fortunes, but through their exceptional diplomatic and military tact, he followed by his son Bajirao, and his grandson Balaji Bajirao expanded the Maratha territories from their initial kingdom's fringes to the north, with their influence reaching all the way to Attock by 1758. The reason for the success in the Peshwa Era, are largely credited to the efforts of Bajirao Ballal, the political tact of his son Balaji Bajirao and the successful Northern expeditions of his brother Raghunath Rao. Therefore, capitalising on the weakness of the Mughal Empire, the Marathas began expansion and after the reign of Bajirao, and during the reign of Balaji Bajirao the Peshwas had expanded Maratha territories and influence all the way to Attock.
Throughout the period of their expansion the Marathas had not only alienated the peasantry of North India due to their practice of looting and plundering the territories their army went through, they had also earned the enmity of many North Indian ruling houses. This was because, when the Marathas weren't folliwng the central authority of the Peshwa in order to accomplish an objective or to achieve success in a campaign, they would hire themselves out as mercenaries in the many bitter civil wars that had sprung up in many states of North India in this period. Perhaps the best example of this is the the War of Succession for the Throne of Jaipur (1743-1750).
