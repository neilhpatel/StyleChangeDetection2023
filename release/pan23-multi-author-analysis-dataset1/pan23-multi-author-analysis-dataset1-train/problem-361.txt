Probably the most widely accepted explanation is deepening accumulation of cultural and technological advances, with each enhancing conditions for those to follow. But rather than linear progression the trend incorporates expansion characteristic of application of “general-purpose technologies” in which a given advance may produce multiple outcomes: just as the modern steam engine emerged to pump water from mines but in more refined form went on to power the revolution in mechanised manufacture and rail and early road locomotion, so writing expanded from listing mundane transactions to recording humanity’s intellectual heritage, and printing and later IT made learning and research available to millions.
There is a fair amount of actual evidence to support this argument. My favorite study correlates on Pacific islands. Suffice it to say that there is still lively debate.
Imagine two sectors, a larger "traditional" one that we might imagine in this instance as initially comprising 95% of the total, growing by 20% in each interval and a smaller "modernising" one starting at 5% of the total but growing by 40% in each interval (which might be a century for most of this period, though this simple model doesn't do justice to more recent trends).
So I think it's likely that aggregate growth not only seems slower in the past but indeed was slower just because the more constrained and hence slower-growing sectors - perhaps "traditional", rural or pre-agricultural or agricultural/artisanal, depending on context - made up a larger proportion of the total than subsequently.
Indeed it might, but on top of that I find it useful conceptually (as in consideration of economic or urban growth, which of course aren't unrelated) to view the whole in terms of faster- and slower-growing parts.
