In a blunt way, Marx had problems with the poetry Tupper wrote, it's a direct contrast of Marx's moral criticism in his works, but in order to truly grasp this, you would need to read at least some poems made by Tupper (assuming you never read them) and then be familiar with Marx's criticism of morality, it's difficult, there is not a clear answer like "oh he hated him because of this", so we need to search a bit further down.
I love this question and I love this answer . High schools should do a better job to explain what a radical Marx was and maybe the pros and cons to that . Thank you for taking the time to do this !
There is a lot to digest here I know, but Marx critique of Tupper's works are basically about his morality, that Christian-Conservative world view that goes directly against Marx, you know, that Victorian period view of the man being extremely righteous and uphold reason above all else? Something like this, to understand Tupper's views on morality, I recommend reading his most famous work Proverbial Philosophy, it's an old book, it's boring, but hey, it might elucidate some mudded things in this.
