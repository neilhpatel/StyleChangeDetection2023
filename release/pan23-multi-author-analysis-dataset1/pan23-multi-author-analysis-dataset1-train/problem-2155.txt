I normally wouldn't be like that. But I do believe in treating others as they treat you. So of he ousts you to make $100 more a month, but loses 5k in fines. Karma.
Texas law obligates landlord provide a keyless bolting device, Texas Property Code 92.153 establishes obligation, 92.164 establishes remedy.
8. The parting shot. Since he's being a jerk about it, take the extra time to look up local legal code and know it. Like the lock on the door identify, document, photograph, and report every violation on his part. No smoke detector? Is a CO2 detector required? Are any parts of the house unsafe? Has he drawn permits for his renovations? Did he need to? Floor sagging dangerously? Bad wiring? Etc.
Regarding your question about leaving half way through the month, Its kind of late now since you posted it 15 days after your notice but you could have found a place to move into today (the first of the month) and offered to the landlord to terminate the lease on the first. Given that he wants to do work on it I doubt he would have cared if you agreed to a shorter notice. Thats kind of out the window now.
