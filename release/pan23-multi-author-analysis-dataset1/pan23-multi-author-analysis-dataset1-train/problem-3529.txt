The university, and its case surrounding this breach of academic integrity, does not need to adhere to standard legal proceedings. It is also important to note that many, if not all university academic integrity policies do not recognize ignorance as a suitable argument against committing academic integrity.
Let me reiterate: your university's policy for academic dishonesty and integrity is not a legal issue. You cannot look at it as one. Your university is following its own guidelines for determining whether academic dishonesty occurred, which is far broader than the sole aspect of cheating. You attempting to claim defamation against the university would likely be a moot point, as the university would have determined under its own policies whether an academic offense was committed. While you having a professor that can vouch for you is a decent start, you should definitely read over your university's Code of Academic Behaviour as well as Academic Integrity policies, and speak to your university's legal department about seeking representation specifically for dealing with university tribunals.

Yes I figured so but thought it couldnâ€™t hurt to ask, I tried looking in the academic integrity/conduct pages and documents but only found what they described as cheating NOT anything about being a bystander, and i realize I could very much have missed it in the entire mix but thank you for your insight I guess I am reaching everywhere to find support as personally I believe the ruling was unjust as everyone who was a bystander still had the risk of being labeled as a cheat and that not everyone in the chat was convicted even if they did say things.
