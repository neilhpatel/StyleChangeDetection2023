I don't think their youth emigration has been quite as drastic as somewhere like Poland, but yes Schengen plays a major part.
It's a major industrial undertaking. After the Chicago Pile, the US built the X-10 reactor and the Hanford site. where already slightly enroched uranium was enriched further via gaseous diffusion prior to being further enriched by a kind of mass spectrometer at another facility.
Yeah. A big theory is that Heisenberg was the reason Germany lost world war 2 because he led their nuclear research team and he deliberately focused on heavy water reactions knowing it will never lead to enough criticality to create a bomb.
They were called . The idea is that you want to separate the U-235 atoms from other uranium atoms and that the ionised uranium will have the same charge but the isotopes will have slightly different masses (due to some having more or less neutrons). Hence, when these ions are accelerated and deflected by magnetic fields they deflect slightly differently by mass allowing certain isotopes to be separated.
Good. To hell with those assholes forcing women to wear a face or hair cloaking cloth because they apparently can't control their dick and even have to "hide their woman's beauty even from their cousin".
