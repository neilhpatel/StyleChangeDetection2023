He shouldn't run as an independent, what if he takes away votes from those Democrats who secretly want to support him but can't because they would never vote Republican It'd make those libs cry Trump supporters are a silent majority, you know!
5. DeSantis has demonstrated recently with the jet flights dumping asylum seekers in New York, that he will break any law to attempt to score political points, especially if he can steal state funds and siphon them into his campaign at the same time. However, he cannot steal as much as Trump can gather from Russians and small donations, and it is fairly likely that Trump's FSB backers will set a trap. They will get DeSantis on record doing something illegal, and then turn him in. DeSantis is as likely to be in jail before the 2024 nominating convention, as is Trump, and more likely to be convicted. Same goes for Ted Cruz and Greg Abbot.

Hilarious! They frame his decisions as being based on politics when what will determine if he stays in the race is how much money he can get suckers to donate.
