Reading Columella, you can pretty accurately reproduce his method of mass producing then distributing fertilizer and exactly how much he expected in yields from his fields and how he planted different kinds of wheat and then inspected them for disease.
Neat, it's in his Utopia. Apparently everyone there knows the art of companion planting. Makes sense.
What you actually see is a patchwork of small (or medium really) farmers organized in unequal power relationships with large corporations that are run mostly out of urban areas. This was explicitly encouraged by the US government in order to suppress food prices. Which is not conspiratorial thinking: Presidents from FDR to Nixon explicitly said this was their goal and they didn't care if that meant the end of independent farming. Nixon called it, "Get big or get out.".
Apparently one of the primary wild ancestors of M. domestica, M. sieversii from Central Asia, attained its large fruits through megafaunal seed-dispersal mutualism, and humans in the area took advantage of those large fruits when they began using detached scion grafts and root grafting to produce asexual clones of desirable cultivars, giving them some control over the chaotic genomics of the genus.
Yes. And they both presume you're Roman aristocrats. Cato somewhat less so: Cato makes reference to the aristocrat actually doing manual labor. My interpretation is that this is idealized.
