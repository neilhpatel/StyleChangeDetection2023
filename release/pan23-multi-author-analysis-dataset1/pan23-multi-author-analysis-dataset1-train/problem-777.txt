I can see how her informal permission for you printing copies could have made it seem like you owned it outright. It's a really common misunderstanding of how custom art works, and I wouldn't want one of my customers to be upset over something as small as stickers, so reaching out with a friendly heads up may sort it all out. Something like "I'm sorry, I was under the impression this piece wouldn't be sold again. It's such a personal drawing to us, is there any way you could not include it in your store?".
The caselaw really hasn't caught up to people commissioning artwork in which the commissioner is an equal creative partner in the work and the work itself is incredibly detailed and unique. Nobody really knows what would happen if you actually took a case on the division of rights in commissioned furry art to court and there are a variety of opinions within the community. For example, a prevalent legal blogger is of the opinion that all of the rights belong to the artist. However, the legal team of a major website is of the position that there is a division of rights since you are a coauthor of the work.
