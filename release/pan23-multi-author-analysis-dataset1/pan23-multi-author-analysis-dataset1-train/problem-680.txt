A leading member of this party just proposed disuniting the United States of America. The staff and leadership of a major news network was just revealed to be actively and knowingly lying to its viewers in order advance the interests of this party. The billionaire who just bought a major social media platform is using said platform to create wholly manufactured “controversies” to push this party’s talking points.

Does it improve our educational system, reduce inflation, or strenhen our domestic labor market to have these little wannabe fascists banning drag shows, creating incentive programs to turn in people helping others get safe abortions, criminalize speech they don’t like, or use the power of government to punish companies who speak out against them?
Yep. This is the game plan. Same with the gerrymandering. It does the damage in the meantime regardless of if/when it gets repealed. And it won’t be repealed very soon.
