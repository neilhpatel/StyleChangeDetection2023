Say you got 100 T-72’s currently in service, and 100 tank crews. Then you get a shipment of 100 leopard 2’s all at once. Congratulations you have 200 tanks and 100 crews. You aren’t going to just stop using T-72’s, in practical terms one tank is as good as any other. So you’ll have a large quantity of tanks sitting around for a while while people are training to use them, that is inefficient. Much better to trickle this stuff in.
Probably the best Ukraine can currently hope for is what another user pointed out: Russia declaring a "Mission kill-only-the-Ukrainian-Nazis accomplished", allowing either for their retreat or easier recapture by Ukrainian troops while the Russian population doesn't make a fuzz about it all being for nothing.
lol the kids cant take the truth. You are correct. A simple google search would show the front line is 2500 km or 1600 miles . What can 100 or even 200 tanks do..But they dont even have 200 tanks promised and the Abrams will be delivered in 8 months for some reason . The US wants to build them from scratch instead of giving the ones already in Europe. My guess is the tanks Ukraine will receive from the US will be a stripped down version hence the reason US wants to build them..
