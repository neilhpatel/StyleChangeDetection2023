Allergies (& asthma) generally fall under the protection of the ADA Act, and you have tried to reach a compromise but your employer is continuing to put your life at risk so it may be time to reach out to the EEOC of your state to make a complaint and begin the process of mitigation or litigation or bring in your union rep into this. Workplaces have to provide reasonable accommodations for those with medical disabilities (severe allergies), it is an absolute reasonable accommodation to have separate supplies and tools for your department.
I usually do have an epi pen. I used my last one back in november after a similar cross contamination incident and haven't been. Able to get a new one yet.
If they fail to participate in the interactive process or they deny the requested accommodation, they must show that it would cause an “undue hardship” on the business to provide the requested accommodation and with few exceptions, need to suggest a reasonable alternative that would accommodate the employee with the undue hardship on the business.
Absolutely. Leave it at that and go to the union. Don't say anything about the issue to this manager or any other employee without union involvement. Edit: if anyone- especially that manager- brings it up or tries to talk to you about it, politely decline to talk about it without a union representative present. Honestly don't even talk about it outside with coworkers, because the sometimes the stores can even use hearsay if the person that relays it to them signs off on it. Just try to do your job to the best of your ability and refer any questions to the rep.
