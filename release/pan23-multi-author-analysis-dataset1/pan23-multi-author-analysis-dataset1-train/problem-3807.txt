India has been lobbying for a seat on the UN Security Council for ages. If they don't "give a toss" about the invasion of a large democratic country in brutal violation of international law, they obviously don't give a toss about Universal Human Rights or the Law of Nations in general.
1. Maintaining relations with Russia will give India some leverage over US. (Playing one against the other. That's what smaller powers do against the bigger ones.).
Hindu nationalist? Every country elects left wing and right wing governments every few cycles. Did you forget Donald Trump got elected by calling Mexicans rapists? Was it a white supremacist government? You either watch too much CNN or read too much Washinon Post.
I don't think it was ideologically so much a White Supremacist government, but it definitely had some cryptofascist tendencies: anti-liberalism, ultranationalism (borrowing it's slogan "America first" from 1930s American Fascists), protectionist economic policies, a certain penchant for the "FÃ¼hrerprinzip", etc.
3. India's relationship with US has improved like never before in last 7-8 years with few hiccups in between. Whereas India's Russian weapon imports have been decreasing.
