I found out yesterday as well after digging around since I also was wondering the same thing. Apparently C-SPAN was barred from bringing their cameras in to record (not sure the date they enforced this) so instead they have been using the official house chamber camera feed. The reason they were allowed to film the Speaker votes last week was because the 118th congress has not approved a rules package at that point. After the rules package was enacted, C-SPAN was again barred from filming in the chamber. This bill would allow C-SPAN to bring their own cameras to film.
Don't upvote murdoch propagandists. They still fully support fascist politicians and basically exist to convince you to vote your rights away.
Gaetz... ...presidential material...seriously? A “suspected” child trafficker, really? You can’t be thinking straight...this clown should’ve been charged a while ago....
