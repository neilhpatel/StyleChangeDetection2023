RTPCR should be taken 5 to 7 days after exposure. Surely some of them have false negative results. The positive results are probably those who already have the virus before the flight.
Which is immune system dysfunction/regulation. But you are correct, we are seeing this happen with COVID 19 patients. And we will be here for decades upon decades constantly discovering the long term effects of this (and all) viruses.
Exactly. This entire thread is just Americans who are assuming that EU/European regulations are as bad as theirs. The EU has plenty of laws on these things and the foreign workers are seasonal workers to help with farming/agriculture because the domestic population aren't willing to fill in all the gaps in those sectors.
Or you lost the battle. As a last ditch effort to rid the virus, your own body/immune system creates an environment that is so incredibly volatile that it kills itself. The virus will also die as it can not live in a dead body. But that’s not good news for you because you also can’t live with a dead body.
