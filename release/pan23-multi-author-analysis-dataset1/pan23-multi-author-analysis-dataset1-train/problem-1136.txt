While that's true, it's not an even "fight" between those trying to hide the money and those trying to enforce the laws. The government doesn't need its accountants to be as good as those in the private sector because the laws are obviously written in favor of the government. The private sector accountant has to be very clever to hide money in a system designed to track it, and if they get questioned they have to show receipts while dealing with the legal system pressuring them to answer truthfully lest their whole life fall apart.
Ha! You can say that again. The point is Reddig recruited the same type attnys who were advising ultrawealthy on tax avoidance. The entire top level of execs at the IRS have all sang the same song.
Really? That surprises me because when they audited the company I work for... I dunno what they found gave us the fattest refund check I've ever seen in my life. Whole thing was pretty bizarre and felt like an expensive waste of time and money for everyone involved except the shareholders of where I work...
