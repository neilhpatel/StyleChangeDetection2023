Edit thanks for your advice though. I’d like to see your sources if you really think you’re correct though. here’s one of my few references.
But just to be real for a second: while venlafaxine CAN pop a false positive for PCP, I've read the studies on those for my drug-related cases, and the dosage you would have to be on would be so substantial and the other circumstances would have to be so unique that the incidents of false positives for that particular drug are virtually negligible. Your narrative of the events wouldn't have caused your body to throw it as a false positive if that's all you took that night (because as serious as your injuries are they wouldn't have caused a difference in the metabolism of the Effexor). The only thing I can think of that might have done that is related to your BP; 270/195 is so high your heart would have likely stopped, so it's possible the hospital gave you additional medications while there. I'd get to the hospital the SECOND their records office opens on Monday and ask for notes that list every single thing they gave you while you were in there, big or small, and then present that with you to the jail when you go in. It likely won't prevent you from staying locked up in the short-term, but it may be the difference in revocation of your sentence or not.
