BRE-X was a mining company in the late 90's that found unbelievable amounts of gold too. Stock went from 6 cents to hundreds of dollars virtually overnight.
Croatian. The Ustasha did a little genocide on the Serbs in WW2 and again expelled around 250,000 out of Dalmatia in 95. Serbs did a lot of bad shit in the 90s, but so did the Bosnjaks, Albanians, etc. Atrocities were committed by all sides. There is no good guy in the balkans.

Thank you. That's really good at understanding the problem. It doesn't propose a solution or guide for dealing with this form of stupidity. Other than rolling tanks up to concentration camp gates. So the power has to be taken away from the source and controller of the stupid people to wake them up. Reasoning and talking might work on the occasional individual but not on the majority of the stupid.
