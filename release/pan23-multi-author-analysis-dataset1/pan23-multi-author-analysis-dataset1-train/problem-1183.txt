Friars were definitely stereotyped as licentious and, to a lesser extent, gluttonous in the Middle Ages. Known as antifraternalism, hostility towards the friars is as old as the friars themselves. A little background for those who aren't aware: friars refers specifically to the mendicant orders such as the Franciscans and Dominicans which were founded from the 13th century on. The mendicants were distinguished from monks and canons in that their chief income was through begging (mendicare is Latin for 'to beg'). Also, the 'secular' clergy which will be referred to throughout are not secular in today's meaning of non-religious - it means that they are regular priests, not part of any monastic or mendicant order.
Brilliant! Thank you very much for this excellent answer. If you do decide to add something more on Abbots, that would be well appreciated. As regards Friars, this is of course a fantastic answer regarding criticism of them, but if you could, even just briefly, touch on positive portrayals of friars, the "merry" part of "fat and merry" if you will, that would be great as well.
