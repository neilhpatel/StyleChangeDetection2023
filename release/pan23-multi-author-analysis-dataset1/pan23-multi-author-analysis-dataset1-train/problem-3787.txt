This past week I read Robin Hood by Jim Bradbury. Overall I think it's a very good introduction to the evidence and main arguments about the origins and development of the Robin Hood story and whether he really existed or not. It's a fairly dry book, Bradbury writes clearly but I wouldn't call it particularly engaging, so I probably wouldn't recommend it for someone with only a passing interest in Robin Hood. However, someone really interested in the subject could do far worse for an introductory text covering the main evidence and arguments of the field of Robin Hood studies.
Hello. I’m looking for anything that has to do with non hierarchical societies throughout history. I follow some anarchist pages on Twitter and some of their tweets are about how societies organized horizontally rather than vertically have existed and thrived. I would like to know more specifics, maybe not about every single one, but at least about the most well-known ones or most “successful”. Thank you for reading.
An interesting aspect of Ivanhoe's influence is that it really cemented the Plantagenet setting even while scholarly consensus turned away from it in the nineteenth century, looking instead to the few medieval sources which place the story in either the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries (most are non-specific, but the one clear reference we have is to a King Edward, no number given, and people tend to favour one of the three famous Edwards over either Edward IV or someone much much earlier). These changes mostly happened after Ivanhoe was published, but did basically nothing to undermine its version of the story.
