It would be sweet, but do you really think there would be much interest? It would be fun to learn, but it's not going to serve students as well as learning a major international language.
To me, the cool part of learning a language is being able to talk to native speakers in their country. I'd love to learn Dutch and then go to Amsterdam and use it. But if I learn Navajo, whom am I going to talk with? The Navajo people all speak English and prefer English, and the younger ones may not speak much Navajo at all. So at least for me, that makes it less appealing.
Schools who have institutionally benefited from the cultural genocide of local native ethnic groups should contribute resources to reviving these cultures.
Not yet. The article you linked is even asking at the end of it for people to petition Congress to make this happen. Hopefully this time the “discussions” happening in Congress lead to something. But, as the commentor above you referenced, so far it’s just been a “next week, we promise” thing for a while.
