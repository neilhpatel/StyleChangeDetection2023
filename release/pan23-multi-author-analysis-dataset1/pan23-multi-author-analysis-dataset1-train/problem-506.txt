Your landlord cannot forcibly remove you without a warrant of eviction, so if you overstay your lease you would be a holdover and your landlord would need to begin an eviction proceeding to remove you.
Thank you for the link! I’m confused because the lease text at initial glance makes it seem like it just converts to month to month but on second read through it sounds more like “if we don’t agree on a lease extension then you’ve gotta get out”. Is that statement in the lease sufficient enough for their required notice since it was in the original lease??
You’ll also want to consider whether your jurisdiction requires a landlord to mitigate their damages — if it does not you may wind up being liable for multiple months of rent depending on how long it takes for the landlord to find another tenant and whether your staying there causes them difficulty in finding another tenant.
However, again, if your landlord has a tenant ready to move into the apartment when your term ends and the landlord can’t deliver possession to that tenant you could be liable for damages to the landlord outside of normal rent damages because of that.
The reason I say set a month of rent aside is because, while typically you may not collect or ask for rent in a holdover proceeding, you may be liable to the landlord for fair use rent of the apartment if you stay for an additional month.
Say your landlord serves you a 30 day notice on the 16th — that would run you to September 16th, then your landlord would need to file an eviction proceeding and serve you with it. Court would probably be 7-15 days from that date of service. In a holdover proceeding, typically, the landlord can only ask for possession. If you are already out of the apartment the proceeding would be moot and would be dismissed.
