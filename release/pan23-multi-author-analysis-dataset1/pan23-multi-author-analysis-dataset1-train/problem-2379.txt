We probably don't have that info now. China goes to great lenhs to conceal the locations of all their nukes, transporting them between silos via a network of highly restricted tunnels known as the "Underground Great Wall of China" and storing them in underground bunkers designed to withstand nuclear strikes. It's the foundation of their second strike policy, designed to make it as difficult as possible to do exactly what you describe without getting nuked back.
days? with the competence and capabilities the Russian armed forces demonstrated (flagship sunk by navy-less country) it would take hours, a single-digit amount of hours.
For what? Nukes? This stupid war has proven Russia’s military is awful. The nuke threat is all they’ve got and it’s guaranteed mutual obliteration. Russia needs to cut its losses.
It's possible that the US military has infiltrated the Chinese nuclear apparatus to such a degree that we have the location of every Chinese nuke, but not particularly likely, given that the PRC has devoted so much effort to keeping that particular information secret.
1000% agree. I really honestly believed that Russia even with 1960's tech was at least a little trained. Maybe somewhat capable of large scale military operations. When, in fact they employed a 40 mi convoy into Ukraine(madness). Showing tactics that were, well, for a lack of better term REDICULOUS. Their military, is inept. So anything that I hear from Russia sounds like a Monte Python threat....
