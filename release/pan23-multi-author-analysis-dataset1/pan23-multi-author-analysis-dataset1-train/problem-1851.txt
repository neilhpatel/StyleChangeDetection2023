Not a lawyer! You and your parents/guardian could perhaps start by contacting the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the FBI. They will probably be very interested since he has been communicating with minors across the state lines. They will also have more resources to help victims like you.
Absolutely not. Please report this right away. The statute of limitations for sex crimes with a minor (under 18) does not start to run until after the victim turns 18. It depends on where the crimes occurred, assuming he was in Iowa at the time and the images were on his computer, the applicable law is Iowa Code ยง 802.2 which states that the victim has up to 15 years after turning 18 to report the crime. Since you are not even 18 now, the clock hasn't even started running so you should absolutely report him immediately. As far as evidence goes, law enforcement can do extraordinary things with computers to find things that have been deleted. It's important to report this immediately, so justice can be done.
