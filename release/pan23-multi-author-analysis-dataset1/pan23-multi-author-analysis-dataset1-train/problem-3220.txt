If the SFR shows that tax was due, the IRS sends the taxpayer an automatic Notice of Deficiency for the unpaid tax, penalties, and interest, which starts the IRS collection process.
1. What about the unpaid FICA (or self-employment tax) for the years 2009-2014? Does he still owe that? Will there be any penalty? (And why do you suppose he was never billed, since the IRS must have received his 1099's? -- At least, we're assuming he was never billed -- he never told us.).
2. Can he still get the stimulus money that he should have received but didn't? (I'm asking mainly because this might provide him with an added incentive to get this done. We haven't approached him yet with our proposal to help.).
For any taxpayer who is found to have W2 and 1099 income but no filed return, the program will automatically generate a substitute for return (SFR) based on the information in the IRS database. That SFR will take the standard deduction, but not include other deductions and credits like dependent exemptions, etc., and will probably overstate the tax due.
Sadly, if the SFR shows that the taxpayer was owed a refund, the IRS does not generate an SFR and send the taxpayer a refund check. Instead, the IRS quietly lets the three-year window for filing for the refund expire and keeps the refund. This money is known as "excess collections" but should be known as "theft from taxpayers." (As you tell, I believe that this is grossly unfair and should be fixed by Congress.).
