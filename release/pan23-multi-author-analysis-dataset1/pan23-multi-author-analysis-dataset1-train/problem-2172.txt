First, a few caveats to your assumption. For one thing, a lot more of the silver that ended up in China came not from Latin America but from Japan instead (although a lot of it did come either through Manila or around the cape). Secondly, although there was a reversal of the silver trade in the 1800s, with the Opium Wars and the Taiping Rebellion, China's silver demand resumed shortly thereafter (the "Mexican Dollar" essentially being the operative trade currency of China, after the Mexican war of independence).
Thanks for the amazing answer! I'm an American who knew nothing about the Silver Purchase Act until today - much less its international ramifications. Now I have a new rabbit hole to fall into.
The Chinese did try to work out an arrangement with the US to have the US essentially artificially prop up the Chinese currency by using the US dollar as a backing instrument: however this temporary measure wasn't really meant to handle the fiscal stress caused by a devastating war, which is more or less a good description of the Second Sino-Japanese War.
If there's less coinage the remaining coinage becomes more valuable. This is deflation, the opposite of inflation. It means that contracts between people, for instance loans of a certain amount of money or wage agreement, suddenly are much larger than the person who agreed to them expected. Then they find they can no longer pay the larger amount and default on the debt or lay off the worker. There are also other factors, has a whole section on it.
Generally speaking, inflation and deflation aren't really "expected/unexpected" per se: if an increase in the money supply is completely predicted, depending on the economic expectations model you are using, there may be no inflationary impact at all. Deflation, however, is in general bad for a growing economy.
