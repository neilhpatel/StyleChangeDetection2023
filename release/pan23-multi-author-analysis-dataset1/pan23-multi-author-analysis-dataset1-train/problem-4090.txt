So, your point is, that every russian is a murderer and rapist? That's racism allright. Tell that to my gf fighting with me over killed mosquito, lol.
Actually, there's plenty of evidence of genocide, ranging from Russia's admission that it's abducting and relocating thousands (as much as 300,000) Ukrainian children with Russia families, to the fact the war is one of the most documented conflicts in history with numerous mass executions and torture incidents.
Ps. Idgaf about the Olympics either. So, see? Common ground. Let's get a beer and talk shit about humanity!
I never mentioned Afghanistan and you can try to convince yourself as much as you want that Iraq 2003 and Ukraine 2022 are not the same but at the end of the day, they were both illegal acts of aggression by a large country, against a smaller sovereign nation without international approval, against international law and the UN charter.
So yeah. Russia is bad. War crimes is bad. But when you saying that whole nation lacking honor. That's bad too, amigo.
However, UN Resolution 1441, which the US cited as justification for the War, was unanimous approved by the security council.
