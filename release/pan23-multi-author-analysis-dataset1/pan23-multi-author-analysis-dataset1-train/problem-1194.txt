Furthermore, for most of "western" history, Greek and Latin formed the entire basis for both a grammar school and a university education. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the primary purpose of a formal education in the English-speaking world was to prove that someone was a true gentleman—what the ancient Greeks would call a καλὸς κἀγαθός—and knowing Greek and Latin was absolutely essential to the early modern conception of what an educated gentleman was supposed to be.
I don't know how accurate this is. I know and work with thoroughly educated native speakers Chinese and regularly there are issues with them not knowing classical chinese, the writing in particular.
Thanks for this answer. Do you know if European countries like France/Spain/Prussia/Germany had similar initial reverence for these languages? Does the emergence of the Humboldtian model out of Germany play a role in these developments as well?
Jing Tsu, a professor of comparative literature at Yale University, argues in her book Kingdom of Characters: The Language Revolution That Made China Modern that, even though the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong strongly opposed traditional Confucianism and the ancient texts associated with it, both the Classical Chinese language and traditional Chinese writing still maintained a very high level of prestige and association with authority, such that even Mao himself practiced traditional calligraphy. As I understand it, in more recent years, there has been a greater burgeoning of national pride in Classical Chinese language and writing in China.
