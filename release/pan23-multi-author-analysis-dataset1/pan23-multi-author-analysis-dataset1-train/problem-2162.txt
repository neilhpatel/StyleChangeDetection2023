IANAL- I'm so sorry this happened to you and your dog. Just wanted to note you might want to apply for care-credit, which is a credit card specifically for vet bills. The interest is terrible but it can help in the short term so you don't need to make decisions for your pet based on money available today, especially as it could take some time to sort out legally. They approve most everyone and you pay it off within 24-36 mos. I used to work in vet medicine and saw many people maintain their pets medical choices in an emergency this way. That being said, many private vets will agree to payment plans with no interest with a down payment, and larger hospitals often have a whole financial services dept for just this. I hope your dog recovers and you get everything reimbursed.
Definitely contact an attorney. I’ve worked cases where people’s dogs were bitten by other people’s dogs and I’ve gotten vet bills reimbursed. It’s considered property damage (I know this sounds heartless but pets are generally considered property). This should be no different, unless your state’s laws are radically different than ours.
