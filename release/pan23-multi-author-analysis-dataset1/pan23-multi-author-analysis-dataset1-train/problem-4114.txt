Their desire to commit tax fraud should not influence you to commit tax fraud. They likely can afford the lawyer and the fines.
This happened to my wife and it screwed us bad, she ended up being "let go" because we had no choice but to file taxes, we need our tax returns just like everybody else, people who are rich will try to get out of taxes any way they can, it's more common than people think, and they have alot of ways around it, like owning businesses that only takes cash and owning off shore accounts, they have really good accountants and give money to charities to hide some of it. It's a pyramid scheme they want all the benefits that the country can offer but don't want to pay their share, this is why trickle down economics are a joke, some of the wealthiest people in our country pay in the same amount of taxes as school teachers, it's sad, but anyways yes you have to file, to them it's nothing they will get out of it by calling their lawyers and their accountants but you will get the book thrown at you. Be careful.
Like many states, but more so in CA than anywhere, the law assumes that anyone who works is an employee, not an independent contractor, unless you work in an exempt profession (hairstylist, attorney, dentist).
