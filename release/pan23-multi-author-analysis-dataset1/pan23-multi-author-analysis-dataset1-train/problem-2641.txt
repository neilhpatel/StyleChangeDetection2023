Yeah I understand what youâ€™re saying but I have to think of the possible repercussions for me and the 2 other people living here if I whistleblow at all in this situation. They could make our lives difficult, refuse to give us security deposit back, etc because we still have a year and a half lease. Ugh thank you tho :/.
This is not really whistleblowing as such - but the practical reality is, you can't compel your landlord to file a W-9 with a third party (and if you could, all your concerns about whistleblowing apply to that case). So since your landlord is uncooperative, you have to consider if you actually are willing to go through with what legal means might be available to participate in this program. And if they attempt to retaliate, you also need to be prepared to take further steps from there; having a long lease actually helps you in this situation as it means your landlord can't just kick you out next month - they're bound to those terms as much as you are. If you are unwilling to take any action that might upset your landlord however... Well, you've chosen not to do anything, then, and that's your decision to make.
