So I think that there is a core misunderstanding that you may have about how a credit history works. Credit histories are not gathered, stored, or run by government agencies at all. Despite the name as a credit bureau they are in fact private companies. A credit history is a file that that a private company has gathered about about whether or not you are a reliable person to lend money to. That is it that is all a credit history is. Private companies have decided that social security numbers, as unique numbers, are very convenient things to attach a credit history to, but they are not actually associated with social security numbers at the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Administration does not regulate and cannot see your credit history anymore any more than your neighbor does. You may contact the credit bureaus such as Equifax, TransUnion, or Experian to request that they transfer your credit history to a new number, but they may not be willing to do so and cannot be made to do so because they are private businesses. They are NOT there to serve you, they are there to serve private entities that buy credit histories. You are their product, not their customer.
Duplicate cases can happen if there are two kids born with the same name at around the same time in the hospital - hospitals generally provide that paperwork and send it in, then it gets entered into a system that may see the two entries as the same entry or a corrected entry.
Good insights here. Would offer a clarification though:: Same name, same hospital. It didnâ€™t get flagged as a duplicate number because there was no duplicate. It was two people using one number.
The Social Security Administration's scope is very limited. Enumeration, retirement, disability, survivors, SSI, overpayments, social security cards, Medicare. They can't contact credit bureaus and have very limited information on you if you haven't applied for benefits.
