In 1980, archaeologists working at Herculaneum (just down the coast from Pompeii) discovered a series of "boat sheds," low vaulted structures arrayed along the ancient beach. During the eruption of Vesuvius, nearly 300 people, unwilling or unable to escape, had sheltered in the sheds, hoping for rescue from a passing boat. Death found them there in the middle of the night, when a wave of superheated gas rolled over the city. Pyroclastic flows soon covered the remains with up to 60 feet of volcanic debris. As archaeologists began to remove the rubble, they found the bones of the refugees in superb condition, and turned them over to a physical anthropologist for close study. The Herculaneans in the boat sheds, it appeared, had come from all walks of life. There was a wealthy man, with the gym-toned muscles and soft hands of a leisurely life. There was a Roman soldier, bones seamed with old injuries. And there were two women who, to judge from their badly scarred pelvic joints, had earned their living as prostitutes. One of these women, in her late forties, had clearly borne four or five children.
> Review of the relevant literature clearly indicates that specific skeletal alterations are not exclusively connected to obstetrical events. Although parturition and related events have been shown to leave various alterations on bone, the research record also demonstrates that other factors can contribute to the same or similar changes. Additionally, such alterations can often be found in nulliparous women and men and are frequently absent in parous and multiparous women.
Thanks for the link. The author of the article I cited was a respected forensic anthropologist; but it is certainly possible that she was was relying on outmoded assumptions about the implications of pelvic scarring. I wish I knew more about the topic...
