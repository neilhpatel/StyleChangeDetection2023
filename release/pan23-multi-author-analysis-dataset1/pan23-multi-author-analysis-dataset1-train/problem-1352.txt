You can use the will to nominate a guardian. I say “nominate” because it is not completely binding. Ultimately, the court will decide, based on what is in the best interests of the child. It is rare that the court will go against the parents’ wishes, though. You can make a statement about why you do not want certain people to be guardian.
You should nominate a primary and backup guardian. The primary may develop a medical condition that means they can no longer care for children. They may take up a new profession, such as Buddhist monk or prison inmate. They may move to Botswana. (You need a backup executor for the same reason.).
In addition to keeping distance from your husband's family and working with an attorney to make clear what your preferences are, you'll want to make sure your preferred guardians are fully on board with stepping forward to take care of the kids. You'll also need to make it a point to reconsider who you have named every few years as circumstances can change due to illness and personal situation. If you can, make sure your preferred guardian is someone related. Courts tend to strongly favor family guardians - even if it isn't necessarily for the kids' best interest.
