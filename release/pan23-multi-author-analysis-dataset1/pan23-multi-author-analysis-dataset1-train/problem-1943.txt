Actually, wages used to rise with productivity - when a company did better, all shared in that. The hourly, the management, the stockholders. In the 70s, an idea took hold that the only people "risking" anything was the stockholders, so they were the ones who should get all the benefits. That's also when they started writing leadership contracts to tie to stock price - i.e. you get paid in stock options and such, so boost that price. As a result, pay for the workers stagnated - if you pay them any more, that's less at the bottom line, and hurts the stock price and the leader's pay.

Really? The BEST? There can be absolutely no improvements? How about a federal requirement that minimum wage aligns with cost of living in each state? How about requirements for minimum amounts of sick leave, maternity leave, health benefits? Surely there are ways the system can be improved.
