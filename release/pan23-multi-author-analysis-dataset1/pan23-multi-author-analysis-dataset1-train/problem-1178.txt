That’s a fair question, and I didn’t get that impression at all! I’ll be honest, nothing really comes to mind for me on the question of life for an average person at the time. That’s a gap in my knowledge, for sure. For the Muckrakers, I would check out Doris Kearns Goodwin’s The Bully Pulpit; she contrasts the consecutive presidencies of Roosevelt and Taft, both Progressives who dealt with the Muckrakers to varying degrees. Highly, highly recommend.
I'm a writer so the average person question is always a bog one when talking about history for me. But I love history so researching it is always fun and I want to know why the life of the common person was like that. And Muckrakers are just plain awesome.
To really understand the Gilded Age, you first have to start with at least a basic understanding of Manifest Destiny and the idea that the growing United States had an obligation to continue growing geographically, economically, and as a national power. Considering America’s rocky start as an offshoot of the British Empire and their role largely being that of a pawn in the tussle between European superpowers, it’s easy to see how generations of young American men felt that their own nation needed substantial growth and it was their responsibility to lead the charge.
