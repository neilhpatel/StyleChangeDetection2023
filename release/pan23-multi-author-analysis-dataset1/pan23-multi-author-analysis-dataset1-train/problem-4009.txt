They've probably gained access to someone elses legitimate in country bank account to receive the money. Then they've transferred it to their own overseas bank account. What you going to do now?
This article makes reference to the Land Registry payouts increasing over time for property theft, which would imply that victims are compensated to a degree, but Â£3m in payouts wouldnt be that many victims compensated if they were returning the whole value of the house that's been stolen. Plus it would be compensation paid by the Land Registry, not by the people who bought the house (because they didn't know they were buying fraudulently), and I'm sure the perpetrators of the theft are generally hard to find and recover money from.
Damn. My insurance company sent me a check and basically said "hey, times are tough and no one's crashing their cars so we don't need this". I mean, I'm sure they still made higher than average profit anyway, but I was happy.
You misunderstand. The home owner doesn't get paid anything, because they didn't lose anything. They still have their house, so they don't need to get paid the value of the home. It would be the buyer's that would be protected via their title insurance.
