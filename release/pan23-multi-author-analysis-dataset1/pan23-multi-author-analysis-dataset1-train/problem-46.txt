But what does "they have found me 80% liable" actually mean, in practical terms? Are they not paying out your claim? Are they just telling you for good measure? In any case, tell your insurance. If you are sued, tell your insurance. Whatever happens, tell your insurance. It's their job to fight for you.
Not the OP, former liability investigator here. Depending on the state, this will do one of two things: in some states if you are found to have contributed at all, then you are barred from recovery against the other party. So in that case, an 80/20 decision would be a full liability denial, but likewise the other party would not be able to pursue the OP for damages since they were found partially at fault. This is called "contributory negligence," where if you contribute to the accident you are unable to collect anything from the other party.
Most states allow for what is called comparative negligence, where you can still collect your percentage of the accident. Let's say it's a case where the fault is not in question, and the OP and other party both agreed to the 80/20 decision. In that case, the OP could collect 20% of the cost of their damages (physical and medical, if applicable), and the other party would be able to collect 80% of their damages from the OP.
