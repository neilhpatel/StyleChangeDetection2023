The Canadian government wants to bring in large numbers of immigrants--and lots of people want to come here, this is why the population is growing rapidly.
As someone who immigrated from China to Canada, I have nothing against mass immigration into the country--as long as they build enough housing. In the end, like the US, Canada has NIMBYism issues. When you import lots of people, you need to build more houses to keep up or else prices go up, and it doesn't even matter much if mortgage rates stay high for a long time. On the contrary, China is experiencing population decline and therefore, home prices will keep going lower there for the foreseeable future even if rates go to 0% and stay there forever.
"They" talk about it all the time. It's not a secret that a good chunk of population growth in many developed countries, where the birth rate of generations-native citizens tends to be lower than the replacement index, is through immigration.
Ah yes, cold and dark. The thing Canadians stoically accept as the price we pay for being born there. In the overall picture itâ€™s not a bad deal; we are some of the most free and prosperous people on earth. Even though a Canadian born person is very adept at dealing with winters challenge, both physically and spiritually, many will go to great lenhs to spend some of their winter in a warmer clime.
