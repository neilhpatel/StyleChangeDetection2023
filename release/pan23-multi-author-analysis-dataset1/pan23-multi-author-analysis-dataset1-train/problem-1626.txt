I applied at a FAANG recently as I was an ideal candidate. It covered CO so they had to give the range. $85k-$159k. On the low side, but I’m in. Do the interviews and get offered the job. HR tells me the real range is $90k-$120k. I said where is the other $39k? It was impossible to get. Basically never existed. It was a lie. A perfect candidate could only ever get $120k HR said. I walked.
EXAMPLE 5.1-1: If the employer publishes a job posting for a job opening that can be filled with varying job titles, depending on experience, the employer should specify all potential wage scales or salary ranges. The job posting should clearly define the lowest.
Exactly! There’s so much of this shitty attitude I can’t stand it. Regardless of location, if you’re willing to pay up to X for a position and you find a great fit, then pay it. Any other factor is irrelevant. Company gets what they want in their expected expense range, who cares what the hire does with that money?
