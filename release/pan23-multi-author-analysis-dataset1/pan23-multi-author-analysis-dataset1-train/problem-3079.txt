SSA employee here. They’re not going to expect that he pays $32K upfront ASAP, they’re expecting that he will make a payment plan with them and uphold it. We get the reality of how most of our clients live. However, if he ignores the overpayment or fights it every step of the way, SSA will take every possible action to get their money (withholding tax refunds, garnishing paychecks, putting liens on property, etc).
He is also looking at for this. The civil proceedings are only one half of this, and to assume that civil penalties are the full extent of these proceedings is daft. Criminal proceedings are likely to follow the collections process if SSA has enough proof that he has been accepting payments fraudulently. Given that they are in the process of demanding repayment, it is highly likely that they have that evidence, or at least the ability to gather it via subpoena. He ABSOLUTELY needs an attorney and should cease all communication with SSA immediately before he winds up incriminating himself any further. If he waits until The SSA seizes his assets and he can't afford an attorney he's fucked.
