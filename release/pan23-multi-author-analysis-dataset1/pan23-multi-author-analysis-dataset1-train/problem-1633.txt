In short, you fill out the paperwork, pay the filing fees, file the paperwork with the court, await your court date, show up and present your case, obtain a judgement, then -- arguably the more difficult part -- figure out how to force the defendant to pay up, as small claims court doesn't put money directly into your pocket.
Same thing about coops, fencing, etc. Sometimes it’s difficult to easily tell the quality of these things, and by the time you realize that it’s not sturdy enough, it’s too late. Also, the size of fence openings can seem similar and fine until you enter a season of chicks or kits and realize the babies can get through the openings. Or a raccoon can reach in. (Think about how few people other than breeders will realize that a rabbit cage with baby-saver wire at the bottom is very different than one without.).
Note that Texas can make it difficult to force defendants to pay up if they, a) don't willingly pay up, and/or, b) have the money just sitting in a bank account somewhere, as Texas really limits the methods in which a small claims plaintiff can levy accounts, seize assets, and garnish wages for non-exempt property and money.
Keep good records of your rabbits’ kindling also. After that kind of fright, you may be out a lot of rabbits if mating shuts down, pregnancies are aborted, or does dry up.
