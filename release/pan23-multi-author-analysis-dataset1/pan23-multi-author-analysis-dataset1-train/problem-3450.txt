You know, that's a really great question! Roman names are kinda funky at best, and knowing how people communicated then, as now, is super important. So it depends. How well do the people know each other, what the setting of the communication is, and who's communicating with whom. I'll do my best to avoid an extended discussion of names in the Roman world (though, for the record, they're super cool and let us identify everything from a person's social status to their probable ancestry and/or family history. Seriously, it's possible to tell from a name that someone was of an aristocratic Syrian family that had been satraps under the Persians, and who were granted Roman citizenship in a certain year).

Aristocrats, as in members of the elite of the Empire and the Republic are sometimes ahead of these general trends (as in the adopting of a cognomen during Republican times), sometimes behind them, as in the late Empire, when they still adhere to the traditional naming system of three names (like Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, one of the contenders for the title of Last True Roman^tm in part because of this traditionalism) while the rest of the population had largely reverted to just using a single name.
Wait, how would that work? I'm picturing that similar to calling your high school math teacher "Jim" rather than "Mr. Wilson" so I can't figure out the reasoning there.
