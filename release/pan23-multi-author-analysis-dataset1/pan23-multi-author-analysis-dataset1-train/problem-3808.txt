In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Agreed. But if you look at r/sanfrancisco, you’ll see notes on cars begging criminals not to break in - mission sidewalks are riddled with Walgreens/other stolen products. Bay Area people are pretty fed up with how dems have treated crimes and empowering criminals as a result of their policies for last 10 years. This comment is an explanation of why it’s getting redder - not support of red.

Democrats have done plenty to assist the wealthy at the expense of the poor—but mostly because, instead of exposing Republicans’ ideology for what it actually is, namely, a system of perpetuating and increasing wealth inequity, Democrats have decided instead just to seek votes by adopting Republicans’ rhetoric, like calling themselves “tough on crime,” and using dehumanizing language like “criminals” to occlude the systems that promote incentives to behavior that is also criminalized. If “progressive” law enforcement officials have tried to reveal this by refocusing their enforcement and prosecution efforts away from theft crimes, then all they have done is stopped using their offices to cover for the system that produces wealth inequity. Because really that is most of what “law enforcement” is about: destroying poor people’s lives so that wealthy people can pretend that they live in peaceful, healthy communities.
