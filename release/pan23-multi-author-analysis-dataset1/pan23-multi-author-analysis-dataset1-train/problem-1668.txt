So, I do not practice in NJ and can not review legal documents here even if I did, but generally speaking, I do not see anything that stands out that is not already the "default" in law. The lease isn't disclaiming obligation of the landlord to place LL duties on the tenant; those are all - and again, generally speaking and I am not saying necessarily/specifically in this case, - the listed sections are just defining obligations of any tenant. I will mention the pest control one isn't written in the best way I've seen, as the tenant has a legal obligation to do basic preventative and pest removal - like not use sugar syrup as floor wax and end up with what might be the most disgusting carpet known to man, made out of nothing but dead ants encapsulated in dried sugar or "don't let 10,000,000 spiders take up camp in dark corners where they can watch the ant carpet in hopes one will escape and come visit them." Minor infestations that can't easily be avoided by regular housekeeping, like these STUPID ANTS that keep finding their way into my office despite the fact my husband has all but installed an ant-proof air lock around the place, are/can be generally assigned as tenant obligation.
