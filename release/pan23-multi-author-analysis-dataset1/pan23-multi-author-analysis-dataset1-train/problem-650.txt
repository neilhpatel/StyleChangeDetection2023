Love this. More true than this country is about freedom. More like freedom for some. But not for you.
Absolutely accurate. This article is lacking sufficient details as to really make a conclusion. He may have, and maybe not. If you’re going to post an article about alleged crimes with no indictment or charges then at least state all the facts as to why. Otherwise this is yellow journalism.
Exactly. That’s what a lot of folks still don’t get. Like with some of these draconian laws being proposed or passed especially in the red states are contingent on selective enforcement. Especially among the “white working class” that supports someone like Trump for example, they think “yeah but he’s on MY side.” Whatever monstrous policy they pass won’t be applied to them. They genuinely love the idea of a multi-tiered system where you don’t need to actually be virtuous, just by virtue of your skin tone, immigration status, who you love, or whatever means you have different rights and opportunity. They are genuinely confused that as a cis white male that isn’t the world I want to live it.
