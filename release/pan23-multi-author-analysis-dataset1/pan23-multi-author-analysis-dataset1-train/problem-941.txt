Twitter was in some serious debt when Musk bought them. And when he bought them he made it a Leveraged Buy Out (LBO). This put even more debt on Twitter and made it so that Twitter would have to pay off the purchase debt... which meant Twitter was now back to being cash poor. And unfortunately Musk hasn't been willing to pump any new money into the platform so they have to work with resources they have.
Not necessarily. Twitter isn't the only game in town and it isn't even the biggest. Hell it's not even in the top 10. As of 2023 it's MAU puts it at 15.
the man who went insane over remote work, to the point of moving his company over state borders issuing ultimatums to those who didn't blindly follow him, building the second largest factory known to man which is still sitting mostly empty, lost 100 billion dollars and burnt his bridges with a whole half of America, most of Taiwan and the whole federal republic of Germany while doing overtures to two of the most despicable ones on the planet.
Yep. The commercial property owners probably will be forced to negotiate a break of the contract or even a lower rent rate (because which company is looking to increase commercial space right now? Not many).
Add to that the fuckups on the front end with them losing Eli Lilly billions due to a fake profile, firing their content moderation groups and the rise in conspiracy and hate speech which is a direct threat to "brand safety" and then on the back end apparently all their account managers got fired so advertisers are upset because they are being locked out of their accounts and have nobody to call...
It's not looking good for Twitter. As an outsider looking in, it kind of looks like they're liquidating the company to try and make as many debt payments as possible to prevent more big Tesla sell offs.
