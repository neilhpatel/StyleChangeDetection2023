That last part deserves a little bit more attention. On 29 August 1839, Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston received a communication from Elliott, written in April, calling for war against the Qing in response to Lin's provocations and divulging his guarantee of reimbursement to the opium smugglers. Following a meeting on 27 September with William Jardine, the recently retired co-founder of the Jardine Matheson opium and tea company, Palmerston and seven other members of the cabinet, including the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne and Secretary at War Sir Thomas Macaulay, met at Windsor Castle on 30 September and 1 October to discuss matters of foreign policy. The products of the discussion would be as follows: firstly, that neither the government nor the East India Company would be footing the 2 million pound bill; secondly, that as a consequence Britain should go to war with China to obtain the funds as an indemnity; thirdly, that the cause of the war was the affront to national honour caused by Lin; and finally, that given the likely poor reception of the news in England, it would be necessary to secure the involvement of the East India Company's military forces first and foremost.
This is really interesting to me! This might need to be a separate question, but h0w common was this interpretation of china? Did many people see them as a sort of kindred imperial state, and did this change the way Britian interacted with them vs. the governments of territories they colonized more directly?
