I didn't say you can have sex and not pay child support. I said you did not have to go through a clinic in all states. (You would, instead, need to have a lawyer draw up a contract.).
Additionally, given the growing popularity and accessibility of retail genetic testing, if you really want to ensure that no biological children knock on your door in the future (not for child support, but for other reasons)… don’t donate sperm.
Proverbial mason jar and a turkey baster. (Though obviously sterile stuff would probably be better.) There's nothing fancy about artificial insemination.
Not trying to be rude- just not sure what I'm missing... I assumed that the two reasonable options were "clinic" and "sex." And I would assume that any contract you could have a lawyer write that would cover the ziplock scenario (or whatever else I'm missing) would also cover non-clinic sex as a "donation.".
It is my understanding that California allows donation of semen for artificial insemination that is not facilitated by a physician. The prospect of relying on (the statute of frauds doesn't even apply !) without a specialized California attorney makes my eyes wide.
