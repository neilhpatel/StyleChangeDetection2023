So, fast forwarding to Katherine Howard. She was guilty of adultery. But what may have contributed more to her death was that she was by religious traditions at the time married to another man, making her marriage to Henry polygamous which would be horrifying and infuriating to devout Henry, leading to punish her less for adultery and more as a sinner, but akin to Anne he was "merciful" and had her beheaded rather than burned.
Firstly age. Henry was 17 and 1st wife K of A was 23 when they married. Like all kings of the period, Henry wanted male heirs quickly, but as a newly married 17 year old he felt that he had plenty of years for that to happen.
It should be noted that although Henry was married to K of A for 23 years he wasnâ€™t patient about the lack of male heirs for all of that time. As Henry and K of A became less youthful, and she was no longer getting pregnant, Henry began to have concerns. He fell for Anne Boleyn and began the process of trying to extricate himself from his 1st marriage. It was a lenhy battle taking 8 or nine years years to complete. If K of A would have quietly agreed to an annulment of her marriage and to fade into the background when Henry first raised the idea, her marriage to Henry would have been of significantly shorter duration.
