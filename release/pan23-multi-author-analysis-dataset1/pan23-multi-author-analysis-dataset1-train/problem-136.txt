This I have gathered from past posts in the sub. Try calling the fire department. They may be interested in this. They are very serious about these kind of things.
3301(d)  Reckless burning or exploding.--A person commits a felony of the third degree if he intentionally starts a fire or causes an explosion, or if he aids, counsels, pays or agrees to pay another to cause a fire or explosion, whether on his own property or on that of another, and thereby recklessly: (1) places an uninhabited building or unoccupied structure of another in danger of damage or destruction\\; or (2) places any personal property of another having a value that exceeds $5,000 or if the property is an automobile, airplane, motorcycle, motorboat or other motor-propelled vehicle in danger of damage or destruction.\\.
Where are you getting that from? There's zero federal regulation on flamethrowers and their use. It's down to state (Only banned in Cali and Maryland) and the county/city code. Hardly 'everywhere.'.
Serious recreational pyrotechnican here. The use of ‘unregulated gas appliances’ is highly variable from state to province so you will really need some local knowledge as to what the laws are and if anyone actually cares to enforce said laws.
