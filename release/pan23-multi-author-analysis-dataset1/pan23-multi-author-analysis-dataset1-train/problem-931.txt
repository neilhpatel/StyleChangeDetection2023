Researchers who study medieval slavery typically assume that about 10-30% of most medieval societies were enslaved. We see them in tax assessments like the Domesday Book, property inventories, and occasionally even in miracle stories and histories. That said, they get short shrift in the general scholarship, and if they appear in popular representations of the middle ages (movies and things), these representations are typically informed by what we know about American slavery before the Civil War. Although there was a lot of variety in the types of slavery or unfreedom practiced in the middle ages, it's doubtful that it ever looked quite like the peculiar institution of the US South.
So I think some of what made US slavery unique was already developing in the 1600s and 1700s, but I don't think it was stripped down to these essential features (which I see as a combination of racist justifications for enslavement and connections to the growth of global capitalism) and stood out in a truly unparalleled way until the 1800s.
Hmm. Possible the fault is on my end for misremembering - it's been a while since I read that part of the book, or it may have been that it wasn't solely agricultural, but I'd be curious what you thought of that section if you ever pick it up. Thanks for clarifying.
Interesting. Thank you. I had no idea so many Europeans were enslaved for the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire.
