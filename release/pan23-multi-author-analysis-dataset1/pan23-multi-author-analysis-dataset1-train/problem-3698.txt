OK, an effort that recognizes we are on borrowed time. We should act and move like a earth destroying bomb is only 20 years away but our current effort will take 80 years to diffuse that bomb; and then we have people like you who dont think this bomb exists and think people who are scared are overreacting. People like you are running shit and that gets people who believe in the bomb to become scared, angry, and demand governments to increase investment into R&D and implementation into renewables as the tech is being developed instead of waiting until they can completely replace fossil fuels. Is that explicit enough for you?
The problem is, the same kind of people opposed nuclear energy, effectively limiting the government's options to renewables (which in Germany's case can never cover 100% of energy needs) and (Russian) gas.
I wonder if these are the same guys who opposed nuclear because it's radioactive, and who would probably oppose wind because the turbines kill birds, and will definitely go on to oppose solar because some vole will not thrive in the panel's shade.
Its not that easy. How will you make sure to have a stable base load of energy, where will you store the surplus of energy for later use? Wich sort of infrastructure is being built is the power supply being expanded for the massive increase in energy the next 2 decades? Within 10 years on renewable's is a utopia nothing more then a dream.
