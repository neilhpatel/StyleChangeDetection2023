Usually only with domestic autocracy, they fought like hell in WW2, and I feel like if anyone started pushing into Russia proper, it would lead to heavy resistance, because to them, their absolute dictatorship is 100% better than anyone elseâ€™s.
No, they don't. They'd want Taiwan even if its a desolate piece of empty rock. People in the US really don't understand this, it seems. To their own detriment.
exactly. While the Ukraine / Russian War will have long lasting and really bad consequences for most of the world, it made one thing clear.
Their homophobia doesnt seem to extend to actual homosexuality. Its used as a submission tactic against military subordinates and criminals on the regular. As long as you're the one getting your dick wet, you're not gay.
The industry and people are a bonus, and why the CPC pushes for a peaceful reunification - but if its hand were forced by a Taiwanese declaration of independence, Taiwan with no people and no industry is a more preferable outcome for China and the majority of Chinese citizens than no Taiwan at all.
Any Chinese leader willing to tolerate a Taiwanese declaration of independence would not stay leader for long; even in dictatorships leaders and beholden to interest groups and domestic pressures.
