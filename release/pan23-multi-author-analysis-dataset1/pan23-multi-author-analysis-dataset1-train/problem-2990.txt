This is on top of him firing his legal council, dissolving Twitter internal Trust and Safety Council entirely (presumably as a way to avoid banning more Nazis just to drive some kind of site interactions), marking links to other social media sites as harmful and shadow-banning people who mention Mastodon (even in a scientific context), and literally begging celebrities in public to stay on his platform as they announce they're fleeing. The man is desperate to bring back his customers as his app continues to shed users.
