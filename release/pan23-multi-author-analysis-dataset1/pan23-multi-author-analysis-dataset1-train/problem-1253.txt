This guy is all over video telling people to go into the Capitol. Was actually on site directing traffic. He's not in jail, never even arrested. Ridiculous.
But the sitting president of the United States explicitly at a rally with written out plans passed & communicates months in advance directing his supporters to the capital and explicit vocal instructions to attack the capital, he totally is not responsible.
I guess I would turn that around. Are you satisfied with the "official narrative" when so many key actors have yet to be publicly identified and interrogated? Those pipe bombs didn't materialize out of nowhere at that specific moment. Those fences didn't cut themselves prior to Trump's speech even being finished. That mob was clearly directed by people who have yet to be identified. Were all those people agents of Trump? Is that the conspiracy theory I'm supposed to believe? Do you believe it?
