Most french far-right groups and thinkers (and there were many of them, France was a very fertile soil for far right ideologies) accepted this narrative. Some didn't : Gobineau (a very influential author for the european far right, who wrote the famous Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races in 1855), who witnessed the shift between the frankish and gallic mythological ancestry, thought that France should embrace her germanic roots. Another far right scientist (the regionalist archeologist Jean-Jacques Thomasset) also obsessed by France's "moral depravity", theorized that Bourgogne (Burgundy) should leave France and join the Reich, as ancient Burgundians were also a germanic people. But overall, after two wars against Germany (a crippling defeat and a victory that left the country exhausted), nobody was eager to accept a germanic national ancestor. The Action fran√ßaise for example, probably the most active and most influential far right group, never cared about the Franks (despite being monarchist), because it was also vehemently germanophobe.
This is something I can kind of answer. The person and organization I will focus on are Charles Maurras and the Action Francaise. Now, few historians consider Maurras a fascist, but he was undoubtedly a far-right royalist and integral nationalist. One of the first fascist parties, Le Faisceau, was founded by Georges Valois was involved in the Action Francaise for several years. Maurras definitely engaged in the mythologization of history. He viewed the French as a Latin people. The Roman Empire brought the civilizing mission to Gaul. Thus the Celts were transformed into Gallo-Romans. His Germanophobia was so severe that he refused to believe that the Germanic invasions of Gaul during the early medieval period had any influence on the developing French kingdom. Maurras did not have much to say about the origins of the French. He was more concerned with the medieval period with its magnificent kings, especially Louis XIV.
