To clarify, since my familiarity with Wilson stems almost entirely from Italian sources, and in that merely from the examination of the relations between the US and the Italian Delegations during the Peace Conference in Paris and subsequent months, where Wilson's personal involvement became nonetheless much more limited (both because of his return to the United States and because of his major health issues), I will only address the points which relate to the Italian matters and make no general evaluation of Wilson's presidential mandate, his career, legacy or personal history in the US.
But, if Wilson's statement had an obvious, immediate, negative impact on the Italian public – as it could arguably be expected to – it was the reaction of the Italian Delegation, with the abandonment of the Conference, and more so with the subsequent “triumphal return” of Orlando and Sonnino, which turned the issue of Fiume and Wilson's opposition to the Italian claims into the main symbol of Allied betrayal and of Italy's Mutilated Victory. Indeed, while Wilson's message had produced a genuine feeling of betrayal and disillusionment in large portions of the Italian public – sentiments which the Government could and arguably had to take into account – the Prime Minister chose to rally on those sentiments of national indignation and outraged patriotism in order to shore up his wobbling political combination and to earn one last shot at pursuing his questionable diplomatic strategy. While Orlando's choice did produce a flare of national enthusiasm, as well as extending his Ministry's life by six weeks, its long term impact was a largely negative one, both souring Italy's relations with the Allies and Associate and further compromising the internal climate which would have required urgent steps towards a general pacification.
I wonder when people mention Wilson was a racist: against who? African people, african american, brown people, italian people..? Is there a chance that his racism was a factor in the Peace talks?
Salandra for his own part (January 20^th 1919) was concerned with his secondary role – he had never been included within the original Council of Ten and no place was going to be spared for him at the “children's table” either, after the establishment of the Council of Four in March – with the “difficult” attitude of Sonnino, who allegedly had already become so irksome as to refuse to speak to his fellow delegates, and with some unspecified “grievances” (beaucoup de griefs) Clemenceau had told him about, but without wasting his time with giving Salandra any details.
During the preparation of the memorandum, the relations between Barzilai and Sonnino seem to have deteriorated even further – perhaps due to the difficulties of reconciling Sonnino's stubborn persistence with Orlando's lawyering around the issue and Salandra's discomfort with the whole thing – to the point where, on February 1^st 1919 the Italian delegate from Trieste had come to the realization that Sonnino was “a true madman”, a “mindless maniac” who “had wasted four years without accomplishing one single thing with his foreign policy”. Going beyond the usual grievances, Sonnino had apparently admitted his role in promoting the press campaign of the nationalist Giornale di Roma (traditionally very close to Sonnino) with the purpose of.
