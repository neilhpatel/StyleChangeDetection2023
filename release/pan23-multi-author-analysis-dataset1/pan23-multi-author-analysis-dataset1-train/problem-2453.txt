It’s very possible they already have created conflict readiness alliance. If I’ve learned anything from the military it’s that civilians are the last to hear about anything. They give bread crumbs, not the whole slice.
The system that Russia has used in Donbas with illegal settlement and creating revolution to be annexed in the “mother land” by colonial settlement is the same that is happening in Palestine, with Isreal that is abusing is status member of NATO and UN, to abuse of power and simply kill people.
No. That doesn't work in urban environments. I don't know how you can look at the war in Ukraine and then come to this conclusion. You clearly do not understand how troops were utilized throughout GWOT.
Supporting sovereignty isn’t a radical or controversial ideal. Ukraine was illegally invaded. Russia has no ground to stand on. It is black and white.
Drones and bombs disrupt enemies from afar, but when you actually want to control territory you put boots on the ground in numbers, they clear street to street, and then you patrol those areas regularly with infantry to maintain control. Those infantry should be supported by armor/air as part of combined arms, but infantry is the core. If you want a GWOT example look no further than Fallujah in 2004.
