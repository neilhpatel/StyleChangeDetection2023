In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes! My takeaway from the past 7 years is....I want career politicians in office. That is all I want in office all the time ever lol.
Seconded. The people who whine and cry about career politicians are the people who voted in Bobert, MGT and Cawthorn. And the only reason why the GOP abandoned Cawthorn was because Cawthorn broke the cardinal rule. the gay incest pictures that were circulating plus and he ratted on his fellow GOP Congresspeople and their cocaine hooker orgies. If anybody’s wondering Cawthorn admitted to incest with his male cousin. It’s not that the gay part should matter it’s that that’s what the GOP was really bothered by, if it was a cute woman they would’ve rolled with it.

Like you noted, a Soviet tactical missile battery within spitting distance of the Eastern seaboard (and crucially DC) was terrifying because it would mean they could now launch a surprise attack against a precise target (the WH or the Pentagon, for example) without warning and without much collateral damage, as a prelude to full scale invasion.
We thought we wanted a place holder...thought that was all we could get anymore. But we want stability. We want someone presidential with a plan. I don't think Biden is an idiot and I don't think he's weak, yanno?
