As always, /u/sunagainstgold is too kind. One of the factors here is grounded in two aspects of /r/AskHistorians: first, there is a tremendous amount of talent here, and the writers often have many publications under their belts; second, most flairs are anonymous, so it is not possible to direct you to publications without revealing actual identifies.
Including you as well of course. Are you perhaps one of those brilliant flairs with an upcoming book?
Have any of the wonderful flairs on this sub published a book? So many of the answers are wonderful because the writing itself is very welcoming to the subject, and I would love to get my hands on a book by a flaired user. Even if it was just to support the enormous effort of publishing it.
It also starts with a thorough look at Suny himself, an autobiographical examination of his background and educational and professional career, which is really interesting. It allows the reader to get a fuller idea of where Suny is coming from, and allows you to understand his own biases in writing, which he is openly transparent of.
