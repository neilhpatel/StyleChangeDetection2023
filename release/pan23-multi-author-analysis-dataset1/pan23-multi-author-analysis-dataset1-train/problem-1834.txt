Khomeini was arrested and exiled; and now the man he appointed to succeed him supports the same practices against others including his niece. There is something to be learned by all including governments by reading chapter 76 of Tao Te Ching, that being open to flexibility and change as a person or organization allows you to live on while being rigid leads you towards eventual death. The government of Iran can survive if it allows for change reflecting and protecting the will of its people; or eventually it and the nation will decline and die….and the efforts of the 1979 revolution will have been in vain.
It’s so crazy to me that the Iranian revolution which fought to end a government that didn’t reflect its he interests of its populace through violence and incarceration…has now reduced itself to being exactly like that government.
And that's where they REALLY messed up. The Chinese disappear people, but make em be nice when they call home. It is ALL THE WAY MESSED UP what they've done to the Uyghurs, but as far as oppression goes, they're the best at using it to keep people quiet.
