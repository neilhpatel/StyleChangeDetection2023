DeSantis built national name recognition — and drew national criticism — while opposing coronavirus restrictions; pushing to restrict school discussions of race, sexuality and gender; and denouncing “wokeness.” Fresh off a reelection that cemented his GOP star status, DeSantis has continued to roll out policies that play well with the conservative base, sometimes positioning himself to the right of Trump.
Everyone should run. Let's create another republican clown car and let it rip. If Trump wins the nomination, the GOP gets smashed in 2024. If Trump loses the nomination, he starts a third party and the GOP get's obliterated in 2024. If Trump is indicted and convicted before 2024, his base stays home and the GOP withers away in 2024.

Two Republicans have officially declared they are running for their party’s 2024 presidential nomination: former president Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, who was governor of South Carolina before serving as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations. Plenty of others are making moves toward getting in the race, as Trump struggles to consolidate the support he once enjoyed in the GOP.
