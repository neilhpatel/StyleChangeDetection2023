In contrast, the Muslim League, which spearheaded the demand for Pakistan, was at times little more than Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his private secretary. The Muslim League was always a party of Zamindars (landowners who formed the feudal gentry of the rural areas) and was never truly a mass organisation. The main aim of the Muslim League was to secure the interests of the Muslim Elite domiciled in the northern plains of India (which had traditionally held power in India over the previous 300 years) and they co-opted the Muslim populace of the Indian subcontinent to this end. In fact, neither Jinnah nor any of his Muslim League ever articulated what Pakistan was to be. And so Pakistan never really inherited any democratic institutions that the Congress party established in India.
Well informed answer. This has been reiterated by many people that Nehru and his cabinet made a very conscious effort to downplay the army and not allow them to have any say in civilian matters. Virtually there is nothing stopping the army in India also to stage a coup except for this invisible civilian pressure.
