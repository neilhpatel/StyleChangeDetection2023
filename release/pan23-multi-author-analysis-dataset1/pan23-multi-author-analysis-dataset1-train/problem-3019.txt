What annoys me about the entire situation is people could die building stadiums, the money could flow through extremist pockets, religions could be targeted for hate and Europe is like i sleep.
1. Doesn’t make it better, the number should technically be irrelevant. even if it are just a few hundred it’s still terrible and should be avoided at all costs. Any project for that matter should avoid deaths, not just the World Cup. So saying “it’s from past projects” is not an excuse either.
>The KNVB campaign opposes discrimination on the basis of race, skin colour, sexual orientation, culture, faith, nationality, gender, age and "all other forms of discrimination.".
FIFA accepted bribes to give its biggest set of games that are only played every 4 years to a desert country with outside temps so high that it threatened the lives of the soccer players if played during the traditional time.
2. Qatar obviously is gonna downplay the number, it’s not like they gonna admit to being responsible for 6500 deaths. They obviously will say the numbers from the guardian are false/different.
