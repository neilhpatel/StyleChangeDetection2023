The District of Columbia, unsurprisingly, follows the same traditional rules for adoption, combination, and hyphenation of surname changes that the Social Security Administration does, even at the DMV.
Thanks for your response! We live in North Carolina, but he was born in Georgia. The lawyer already had him go get his fingerprints taken and I guess everything is filled out. As far as we’ve been told, the paperwork is just waiting down in Georgia for approval I guess? I don’t really know, honestly.
The Regional Chief Counsels of SSA all revisited the topic in 2015 because of various Supreme Court decisions regarding same-sex marriage, and took the opportunity to clarify their policies based on a review of statute, common law, and case precedent. My reading of the on North Carolina name changes is that SSA does not allow a change of a person's first name, or their last name to a novel name, because of marriage.
SSA does allow that some states might have an explicit statute that allows for adoption of a novel surname, or a first name, that neither spouse has. , for example, allows that by statute unlike the other states in the region.
