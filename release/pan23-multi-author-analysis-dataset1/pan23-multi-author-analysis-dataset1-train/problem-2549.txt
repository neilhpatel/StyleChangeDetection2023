In all seriousness, I fully expect to see the resumption of “concluded” conflicts to start back up. Which sucks.
The only two problems i can really think of that in the balkans that aren’t national issues (like corruption) or problems that include countries outside the balkans (like the recent austria-romania beef) are turkeys increasingly aggressive stance towards greece, and blugarias dismissal and hostility towards north macedonia.
Because they were cool? (When not at war with each other or doing human sacrifice). They were very advanced and civilized. Their astronomy was second to none, and their calendar was extremely accurate. They also had advanced math and independently invented 0. For reference, the Europeans didn’t. They got it from the Muslims in the Middle Ages who in turn got it from the Indians. You can’t do advanced mathematics without 0. They were also really good at building lasting monumental architecture.
and why didn‘t you vote? turning a blind eye and not contributing to change at all is as bad as doing it. why don‘t you consider that your opinion may be the minority of the rest of your country?
