If its not an IRRRL loan then still write them explain that you refied with the intention of remaining however xyz changed and you were acceptted to abc University in nowhere. Advised you confirmed VA policy states consent shall not be unreasonably witheld and inferring that i am contractually restricted from pursueing University or and contractually required to limit my choices counts as unreasonable.
Thank you for this. I will put it with my notes.They know about my school because I told them. I called after the refinance to verify if I could move out of my house and rent it while I was in school. They told me no and pointed to my deed of trust which states the occupancy requirement from above. Since then I have been working under the constraints of the deed of trust trying to get written permission to vacate. There is also the affidavit of occupancy that states I will use the house as a primary residene for one year that scares me.
The denial letter just included the affidavit of occupancy that I signed stating that I will be using the property as my primary residence. Really not much more than that.
Mortgage Servicing Escalations here. Now this is not written in stone, amd I am probably not your servicer. However I get one of these every few months and we grant them as long as the reason is understandable. This one, i would grant.
