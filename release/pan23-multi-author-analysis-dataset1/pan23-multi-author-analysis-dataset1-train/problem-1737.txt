The American "Tiki" scene (I'm going to use Polynesian Pop Culture or PPC from here on out) got started before WW2 with some themed restaurants that became wildly successful on the west coast. The earliest on record is Don the Beachcomber's, a restaurant started by the son of a prohibition-era rum bootlegger named Ray Gantt who eventually changed his legal name to Donn Beach. His restaurant was decorated with "beachcomber" style artifacts (nautical, tropical, vaguely referencing prior ideas like Robinson Crusoe, etc) and featured a menu of mostly Cantonese cuisine with made up names (Crab Rangoon anyone? Rangoon - now Yangon - is a Tibetan city, far from the ocean with help from /u/sukritact adding context, Yangon is coastal, but the dish is absolutely not traditional or from the city, and cream cheese was never a traditional Asian ingredient) and riffs of traditional Caribbean rum-based drinks with likewise fantastical marketing names.
Great answer! A quick geographical note about crab Rangoons: the city of Rangoon (present-day Yangon) is not in Tibet but in Burma (present-day Myanmar) and is in close proximity to the sea. While Trader Vic's claimed the dish was based on a traditional Burmese recipe, cream cheese is essentially non-existent in Southeast Asian cuisine so it's true links to authentic cuisine beyond the crab and fried wanton wrapper are, as @khudgins mentioned, unlikely.
Thanks for the response. You're absolutely right. The tiki bar phenomenon is only one small aspect of a much larger topic that is still ongoing and likely will be for a long time forward.
