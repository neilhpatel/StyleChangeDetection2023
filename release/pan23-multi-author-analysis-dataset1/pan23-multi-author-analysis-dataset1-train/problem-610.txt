The most diverging practice is that of the British. Prior to 1870 annexations even outside of Europe had generally been accompanied with a succession of debt, a change that began with the annexation of the Fiji Islands in 1874 with restrictions of creditors rights and eventually leading to the annexation of the boer republics after the second boer war (1899-1902) where it initially did not take on any debt obligations.
This view of taking on debt continued to be the prevailing view on the continent and was followed in the Italian unifications (1871) where the debt of the unifying nations was taken on and turned into Italian bonds, and it was also generally followed in the various Prussian conquests, however the wars with Austria and France (1866 and 1870) did not involve that substantial changes of territory and no agreement on debt transfer.
Thank you for the incredible answer. As a law student it is fascinating to hear about how customary international law has treated state debt in the past.
