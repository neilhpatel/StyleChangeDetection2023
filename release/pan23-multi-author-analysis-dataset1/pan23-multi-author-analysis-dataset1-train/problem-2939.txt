We do pay too much in tax - for what we get anyway. But they should at least be progressive and they're anything but that in reality. There are "official" rates and what's actually paid. Big difference for the wealthy that can afford accountants that specialize in tax evasion / loopholes. For example, the previous president. Loopholes aren't even necessary for real estate and long term capital gains. Billionaires pay a lower % of their taxes in capital gains (15%) than people in poverty do. Landlords devalue their property when paying taxes and inflate it when reselling. They they just use another property to offset losses from tax, if ANY of the taxes are ever realized at all. They can defer them FOR LIFE.
Ok, but corporations will use their record profits to hire enough politicians, think tanks, and media talking heads to lie, gaslight the public, point to labor as the problem, and prevent the political system from accurately diagnosing or adequately addressing the issue.
Absolutely. Are you not familiar with just how many people (outside of reddit, clearly) donâ€™t believe common sense? Those that need to be consistently beaten over the head with facts until even a semblance of something sticks?
