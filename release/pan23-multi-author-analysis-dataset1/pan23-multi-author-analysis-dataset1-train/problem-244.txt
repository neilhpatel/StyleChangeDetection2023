INAL but having gone through a new car Lemon the hassle was arduous, painful, and time-consuming. I had to document everything. After my 5th trip for the same issue, I started to speak with lawyers that were versed in Lemon law and Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. By the time it was finally done I had over 30 trips to the dealer including the day before arbitration. In the end I was cut a check for the value of the car minus mileage + back milage and time for going to the dealership. I used dealers in multiple cities over a 300 mile range (I moved.) Even if lemon laws would not apply to you document everything. Save every piece of paper, scan and label or take pictures and label. upload to the cloud and your PC (or gmail) just for backup incase something happens in one spot. Here is a good article from Edmunds not as helpful as you'd like but I pasted some of the relevant stuff. Being the infotainment system is at issue, that may help increase toward the "safety issue.".
While there are no laws obliging them to do this for you, they may accept it as a favorable alternative to the potentially expensive notion of letting you tool around in one of their loaner vehicles indefinitely while this CPO-warrantied car full of gremlins sits on their lot waiting on parts from Korea that may or may not get there at the promised time () and that may or may not fix the issue.
Sounds like you got a bad remote starter installation. I would be going after whoever installed it. Not sure how automotive insurance is bylawed in UT, but i imagine you should get them involved, you have electrical damage no doubt.
