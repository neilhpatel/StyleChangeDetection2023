The other broad category was the galley. Oar-powered with sails that could be raised or lowered, galleys were predominantly used in the Mediterranean, but could be hired in for special purposes. The French hired twelve Genoese galleys to assist their Spanish and French fleet to support its efforts against Flanders in 1304. Galleys often carried rams, but were also equipped with fighting decks or truncated fore and aft castles as well. They were more maneuverable, but much more expensive to operate, as the rowers needed pay and food, and were far more numerous than the crews of nefs.
A way to deal with this was by using galleys or other oar-powered vessels, but then it butts up against the need for hired crews, and even if you can impress them or coerce their labor they still need to be fed, and that costs a great deal of money. Venetian and Genoese galleys were typically trading craft, and each man on top of their pay - neither Genoa nor Venice predominantly used slaves, though slaves were sometimes used and Genoa did trade in slaves, especially from Eastern Europe - had a little spot in the cargo area for personal trading, meaning that a large part of the lure of working a Mediterranean galley was the prospect of making a big score in trading spices or some other commodity.
How these were used is not entirely clear beyond the fact that they were regarded as a form of light artillery. It's plausible that they were used to shoot single, accurate shots designed to pierce heavy armour or shields and wound critical personnel. One 13th century chronicle, speaking of a siege, suggests that the bolt of a crossbow of two feet was capable of killing a man after penetrating window shutters, so it's not hard to imagine something similar occurring through a shield.
I'm late to the party as always. Excellent answer that I have little to add to where it comes to the nature of naval combat.
