There isn't really a way to pre-emptively ensure that. No marital instrument can pre-determine custody and child support issues: they're always evaluated when the issue arises and based on the facts and needs as found, including factors like the best interests of the child and equitably protecting each parent's relationship with their children.
I wouldn’t do it. It’s never a good idea to put yourself in a vulnerable position if your marriage is already rocky. At the very least contact a lawyer and seek a consultation about your situation. Don’t do anything blindly. At least find out what you’d be up against.
If you move to Ohio long-term, and then divorce, and your husband wishes to remain in Ohio and you want to move back to Oregon, it'll likely be on you to propose a plan for custody and visitation that can accommodate that, and to figure out how to manage the costs of travel. The longer you live there, the more true that is: if you move there and you separate the next week, both of you would be expected to hear the divorce in Oregon, instead, for example, or to wait at least six months to establish residency.
