Iran funds the Taliban, they fund pretty much any war happening in the middle east against Israel, US, or Saudi proxies. They're sending military equipment to Russia for the Ukraine war (exploding drones). And all that on top of the fact that they are currently sending mounted heavy machine guns on back of Toyota pickup trucks to shoot at civilians in kurdish regions right now. They will round up protestors in ambulances and throw them in prison. They rape women in prison, and they do so openly with the excuse that they are preventing them passage to heaven by taking away their virginity. They're literally killing children on their own soil. At least the US government isn't directly doing those things to their own people. (I know, the prison system is fucked up, but again... It's not as direct).
Then the corrupt fascio-capitalists can allow the law-respecting and regulation-respecting capitalists to actually have some faith in their democratic institutions once again.
It's not "pussy out" . It's that they don't want to ditch the money. That's also why Western nations are in bed with the likes of UAE and Saudi Arabia.
