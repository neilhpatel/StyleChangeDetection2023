Once budget cars with lower ranges become accepted (with the ensuing expansion of the charging grid to make that easier to live with), non-lithium ion batteries can start to make a dent in the EV market. the dominance and scarcity of lithium for its high performance is a bottleneck at the moment, and if a maker is willing to go ‘yeah this EV has half the range of tha competition, it’s also half the price and the batteries are made 100% using US sourced battery tech’ then that’s the door a bill like this can open.
Of two minds on this. I bought a VW Id4 last fall. Glad to have bought it even without the rebate (only reason it was even available was because someone ordered it and bailed when they discovered they would not get the credit). I don't even make enough to get the full amount but would welcome the rebate. Yet, the strategy behind restricting it is solid. And the union response suggests it has gained purchase quickly. It will be interesting to see what happens. I won't say no to some free money - and incentivizing purchase of EV'S should not be limited. But a leader needs to protect his country's economy. So either way I guess I will be behind whatever happens ha.
