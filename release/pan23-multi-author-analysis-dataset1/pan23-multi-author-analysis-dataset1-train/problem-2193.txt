Wow, that's a really shit article that cherry picks elements to cast doubt on American media and military. Legal Eagle just did an about this, and point out that China's claims are all ridiculous bullshit, like claiming it was a weather balloon, which would be legal, if under certain size and weight restrictions; spoiler, it's dozens of times larger and heavier than what the international law allows, or would feasibly be a weather balloon. Just because the US isn't publicly detailing every element of info they may or may not have does not make them hawkish on this incident. I just lost a lot of respect for this news source.
manufactured theatre to gradually manipulate people into believing conflict with China is necessary, all to distract from cavernous wealth inequality and a growing poverty crisis.
Yes. Never before has there been a time when multiple noteworthy things happened simultaneously /s. Also, the general public has next to zero interest in the Hunter Biden story. It is not moving the needle. China is the world's second largest economy, and also becoming our biggest rival due to their aggressive attacks on our sovereignty. Hunter Biden's dealings, and the recent spy balloons do not have to be related to be true.
