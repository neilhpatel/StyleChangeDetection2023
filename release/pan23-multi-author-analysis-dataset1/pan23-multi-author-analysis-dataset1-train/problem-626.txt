You would likely be unable to get your sister's medical records from the hospital until she is released (because she's presumably an adult, I'm guessing, and thus without a Power of Attorney authorizing you to do it you don't have the right to access her medical history), but if she wanted your help there's nothing saying you can't assist her. Having said that, however, the fact that she had this reaction DOES NOT mean that it's malpractice, even if the doctors have said in hindsight she shouldn't have been given it; the standard is whether, given the circumstances and information provided at the time it occurred, the EMTs provided "reasonable care," and what they knew at the moment before they gave her the injection is going to control here.
You said she already has a weak immune system. If your sister was ill enough to need an ambulance, I donâ€™t think the epinephrine was the sole reason she went to the ICU. Frankly, someone with a weakened immune system should not be on a plane during a pandemic.
