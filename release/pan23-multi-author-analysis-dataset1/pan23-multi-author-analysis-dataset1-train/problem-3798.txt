Wisconsin’s adverse possession doctrine is a mix of statute and case law. Under Wisconsin’s adverse possession doctrine, there are three scenarios in which a person or entity may take title to the real property owned by another person or entity: (1) by continuously occupying the property for 20 years and claiming the property as his or her own property despite having no instrument actually conveying the property to the adverse possessor; (2) by continuously occupying the property for 10 years under “color of title” (usually occurring when a written instrument or court judgment mistakenly conveys property to the adverse possessor); or (3) by continuously occupying the property for 7 years under color of title and payment all taxes and assessments associated with real property being paid by the adverse possessor during the 7 year period.
This is a good analysis. However, I think the concern is that the people using it will claim after the death of the one person who could refute the claim that it was by permission, not hostile. There should be something in writing from the owner that gives them license to use the property for their purpose. If there's nothing, then what's the prevent the users from saying that they planted the garden there contrary to the will of the owner?
