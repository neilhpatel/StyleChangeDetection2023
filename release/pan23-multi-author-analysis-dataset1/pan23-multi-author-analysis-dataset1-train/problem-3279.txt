It is very good. It is obviously current with scholarship, much originating with Evans, and covers a tremendous amount of material. It also reads about x2 faster than one would expect.
Hi there anyone interested in recommending things to OP While you might have a title to share, this is still a thread on /r/AskHistorians, and we still want the replies here to be to an /r/AskHistorians standard - presumably, OP would have asked at /r/history or /r/askreddit if they wanted a non-specialist opinion. So give us some indication why the thing you're recommending is valuable, trustworthy, or applicable Posts that provide no context for why you're recommending a particular podcast/book/novel/documentary/etc, and which aren't backed up by a historian-level knowledge on the accuracy and stance of the piece, will be removed.
Absolutely. He is one of the most respected historians of European/German history (commissioned to write a volume of the prestigious Oxford History of Europe among many other recognitions), and I find his work much easier to read than many other comparably rigorous historians.
