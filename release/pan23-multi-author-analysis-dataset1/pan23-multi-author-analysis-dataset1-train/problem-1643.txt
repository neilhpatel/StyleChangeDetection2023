Many people helped him carry it out too. Who gave tours; set the "gifts" on RNC/DNC property; those who voted to overturn votes; those who voted to not remove Trump; people who ignored subpoenas; people who had info but didn't say anything; Ginni Thomas, Rudy Giuliani and Roger Stone. Of course Clark, Eastman, Powell, Chesebro too.
