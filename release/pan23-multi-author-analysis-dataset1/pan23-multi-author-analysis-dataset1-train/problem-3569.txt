The way it's worded also directly impacts anyone who's transgender or simply gender non-conforming, from making any sort of appearance late at night, or before noon on Sundays. I'm certain that's intended.
Having talked to some gay people about what roll porn played in their development it might actully good that teenagers can not access gay porn since for gay people hardcore gay porn is the only gay thing they see leading to the hypersexualisation of gay people with many gays reporting that they do not know what to do besides sex. So breaking the cycle by cuting of young people from watching gay porn might help with that but that gay prn leads to the hypersexualisation is only a theory the other theory is that man are natural hornier than woman and since in heterosexual relationships the woman modulate the amount of sex there would be naturally less sexualisation in those relationships.
Maybe. Though "room for interpretation" could be problematic, and if Elliot Page showed up in a tux at some fancy function, for example, some asshole could arrest him.
