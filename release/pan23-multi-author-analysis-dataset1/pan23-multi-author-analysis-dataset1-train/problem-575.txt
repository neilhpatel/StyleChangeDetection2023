Thank you very much. So while the Soviet Union did undeniably bad things (war crimes, forced emigration, gulags) they never practiced genocide in the same manner as the German Nazis? Is that a correct conclusion?
During the deportation and arrival in their new homeland these people had to face immense hardships, often many perished during the journey or the early years of settlement, as the new lands were generally underdeveloped. But the express function of the deportation was not to commit complete genocide but rather to get these people somewhere else where they could do no harm and still be somewhat useful in the Soviet system and serve as an example to those who remained behind.
While the Soviet-Union practised deportation and punishment along ethnic lines, they did not set up true death camps with the purpose of just killing people. Under the rule of Stalin especially deportation of native peoples to Siberia and Central Asia took place on a massive scale.
Now while the Soviets did have forced labour camps, gulags, they were once again not purposefully made to kill entire groups of people. Conditions could be extreme as prisoners held there faced famine and repression and many people did not make it out. Inmates send there served as an example to society, what would happen to criminals, collaborators and those trying to undermine the state and were made to do forced labour such as mining, building railroads or other work.
