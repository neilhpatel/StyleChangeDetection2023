NAL as a mailcarrier I would also say to tape a card with the last names of who may get mail there in your mailbox. You will still get anything that includes 'current resident' on it. You may also have multiple carriers delivering in your area as we have a shortage of employees and if that is the case you will probably still get mail for other people unfortunately. While I rarely suggest writing on the mail, in your case I would say to write UTF (unable to forward) on the left side of the address on the item and you can either leave it for pickup in your box or put it in any collection box that is convenient for you. This should divert it in our processing plants and return it to sender. Hopefully this will help.
You can also submit a request - - select "I receive someone else mail" - request a MLNA (moved left no address) request for (previous resident name) as you are receiving daily first class mail for this individual and they no longer live at said address. This will send an email to your local mgmt and open a complaint case.
