It has come to that time when coalition countries must decide that Russia is an existential threat to all of Europe. Just like in the 1940's, a rogue actor thinks he can rule the world. And as much as I dont want WW3, it has arrived on our doorstep nonetheless. Ukraine needs foreign armies to commit to boots on the ground, much like the 1940's. War is here... like it or not. To delay is to perish.
However the West can and is ramping up production of largely technologically superior heavy weapons, many of which can eliminate targets outside the max range of soviet equipment.
yep. The main thing is that as things stand, russia would eventually wear down Ukraine through sheer strenh of numbers; we need to make sure that Ukraine has whatever they need to push russia out of Ukraine and even strike military targets inside russia, so that they no longer have the ability to field fresh equipment and soldiers to continue the invasion.
is a pretty good assessment of the russian threat; they made a lot of mistakes earlier in the invasion, but they seem to have learned and adapted, and they still have a significant numerical advantage over Ukraine, and the benefit of long range missiles that makes no corner of Ukraine safe.
