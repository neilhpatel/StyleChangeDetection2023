If you want to say that railways allowed the Russians to sustain their conquests, then maybe, but the Qing sustained control of Xinjiang for some 70 years without resorting to colonialism, and when they did engage in settler-colonisation they did so with no rails either.
Except neither of the major sedentary conquests of steppe powers – the Qing against the Zunghars in the eighteenth century, the Russians against the Kokandis, Khivans, Bukharans, and southern Kazakhs in the nineteenth – was achieved off the back of a rail system. The Qing marched into Zungharia in 1755-7 with tens of thousands of camels and pack horses, not the as-yet-uninvented railway; the key Russian victories in the conquest of Central Asia – the capture of Aq Masjid in 1853 and Tashkent in 1865 – were achieved before there was any rail system in the region. (The first permanent railway to the organisational HQ at Orenburg was started in 1874, and the Trans-Caspian rail route was only established in 1879, after the defeat of Kokand.).
Just to expand on it a little: if we're talking about settled peoples really subjugating steppe peoples militarily in any serious, permanent way, then we're mostly talking about the Russian Empire and Qing Empire in the 18th and 19th century.
