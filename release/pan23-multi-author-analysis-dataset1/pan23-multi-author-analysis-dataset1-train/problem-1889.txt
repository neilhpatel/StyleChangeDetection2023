Sadat's main focus during the negotiations was the return of Egyptian territory (the Sinai), which, he claimed would put Egypt in a better position to help negotiate a settlement for the Palestinians -- trying to negotiate Egyptian sovereignty over Gaza would have been problematic for other Arab nations, most of whom were already very unhappy about Egypt negotiating peace with Israel in the first place (in their view, the Palestinian issue should have been resolved first before the Egyptian peace accord, but the loss of territory had been a huge blow to Egypt in 1967 and Sadat, who was not a very popular president, also wanted to boost his standing in Egypt).
Remember, the original question was why Sadat didn’t want Gaza back - just because their international position had to officially be that Gaza wasn’t officially part of Egypt, just “administered” — as opposed to Jordan, where the unity of Jordanian and Palestinian land was emphasized repeatedly — doesn’t mean that Nasser didn’t see a huge amount of strategic value in using Gaza as a military asset against Israel…which, ultimately, is why it was occupied by Israel in ‘67.
Hm. So Sadat felt a need to maintain some "international position" that Egypt and Gaza were separate things. But simultaneously, Sadat also wanted to create a pan-Arab union with anyone who would come along. Why not assert a "pan-arab union" of Egypt and Gaza?
Gaza was surely a part of the United Arab Republic, though, so maybe Gaza left when Syria left? Or maybe Gaza was never truly "incorporated" into that Republic?
Administration is not annexation. Egypt’s official status was that they were administering Gaza on behalf of people who were unable to do so themselves. They had hoped that a future Palestinian would join the United Arab Republic, but the experiment barely lasted two years as it was.
