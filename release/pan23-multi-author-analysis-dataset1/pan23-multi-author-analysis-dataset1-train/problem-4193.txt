Yeah the article points that out, that now that don’t have to account for a new vehicle (no legal title, no insurance) can now just steal any, including in Russia, bc don’t have to declare it (like for registration or taxes or anticorruption purposes).
Exactly. I mean, 20 HIMARS (plus the M270s) is good, but even doubling that could end this much more quickly. Ukraine has at times been days behind on hitting targets we hear about. They surely have a very long list of targets that must be prioritised, and the same is said for their artillery. They're not hitting near what they could because they need to conserve ammunition.
Partially. Those sent to the front are just there to plug the gaps, and everyone knows it. There are potentially a few hundred thousand that in theory could be getting adequate training now. To be able to do more than dying in foxholes.
Modern computer-aided design and manufacturing has substantially cut down the time from idea to finished-products coming off of an assembly-line, especially when motivated.
because of Putin…failure to seize Kyiv. [no integration of actual intelligence, no plan for Ukrainian air defense, and thus the loads of reinforcements never landed at the seized Gostomel airport.].
