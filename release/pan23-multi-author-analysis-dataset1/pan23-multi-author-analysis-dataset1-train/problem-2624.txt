Military music has the same effect of being simple, repetitive, and easy to sing. While the folk songs created a sense of nostalgia and romanticized peasant life, military music displayed the glory of the Motherland, which the people had fought to create. As for choral music, this was heavily promoted in the Soviet Union as well, starting around as far back as the 1920s under Lenin. Choral music, of course, requires a large number of singers who all work together to sing the same song, appealing very much to that Communist ideology. By combining the patriotism of military music, the camaraderie of choral music, and the nostalgia and idealism of folk music, Socialist Realism had a very effective formula in terms of stirring the revolutionary sentiments and pathos of the people.
I'm surprised you put Ustvolskaya in there. She was around later and belongs more to the post-Shostakovich generation musically (though she was older than Tishchenko, Gubaidulina, and Schnittke), achieving maturity only in the post-Stalin era, where (especially under Khrushchev) the policy vis-Ã -vis artists was a little freer. Kabalevsky might be a better fit.
