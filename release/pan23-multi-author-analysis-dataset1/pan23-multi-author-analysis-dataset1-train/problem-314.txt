"The revolt against Mr. McCarthy, who for years had been considered the obvious choice for speaker should Republicans win control of the House, has been led by a small coterie of ultraconservative lawmakers who have been the most outspoken about their opposition to him. It also includes a larger but quieter group of lawmakers who have long agitated for changes in the way the House operates, and a set of newcomers who have remained largely silent but are weighing their options.
It’s all a fucking show. They’ll fall in line w/the 2nd vote because what choice do they have? Who’s the alternative? Vote for the Dem?? Hell no. Nobody else came.
Also, a significant part of the Republican Party fundamentally does not believe in government and views any government as evil (Reagan - government is the problem). When such people are elected to government chaos and bad things are inevitable.
