Simultaneously white Senate asked for German help , and German Ostseedivision made an amphibious assault against southern Finland, taking Helsinki.
Very interesting read. It makes sense that the Russians would be less inclined to support the revolution as a result of Brest Litovsk. It's just a conflict I have never put much thought into yet remained relatively curious about. I'm from Sweden and the war between Finland and the Soviet union is brought up in detail. But not the Finnish civil war.
Leadership. Whites had an effective command structure on all levels. Red command did not work at any level. Highest prewar military rank among red leadership was 2nd leutenent, first commander in chief, Ali Aaltonen. He was cashiered due to drunkedness, and replaced with an amateur. Whites had General Mannerheim. Reds voted for company commanders, whites appointed trained Jaegers and imperial officers for those roles mostly. White troops fought loyaly, red troops mutinied, changed leaders and went on leave from frontline without permission.
