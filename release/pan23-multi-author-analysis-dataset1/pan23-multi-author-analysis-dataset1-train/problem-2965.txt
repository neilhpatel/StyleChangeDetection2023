this is a good idea. I agree I was initially worried about calling the police because they definitely are not equipped for these kinds of situations- plus I wasn't sure they could really help at all here... I'm definitely leaning towards this option because I saw her driving the other day so something just isn't right- seeing this woman's mental state and seeing her get into a car to drive scared me more than the letter because there is no way that someone in her state should be driving a vehicle.
NAL But Ph.D. Psychologist instead. You could contact your local government mental health agency, tell them what is going on, and ask that they visit her. There is no guarantee that they will do so, or that if they do, that they will be able to do anything, but it's worth a try. You could also call the police, but this is very risky, as police encounters with mentally ill people often turn out very badly, since the police are unpredictably dangerous and have essentially no training in mental health. That said, you might not have any choice except to do this. Based on your description, she sounds potentially dangerous.
