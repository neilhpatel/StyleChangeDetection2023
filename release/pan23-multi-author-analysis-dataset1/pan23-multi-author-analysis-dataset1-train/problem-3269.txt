Actually, what makes the most sense is each of you having a small supply. He can have his stored at the school and administered before she leaves on Friday, so you both are getting your way. Will a judge see it that way? Who knows.
If your current divorce decree does not specify which parent is responsible for medical decisions, then you need to get it I writing so that he either has to allow you to administer the shot as needed, or follow through with it himself. I am sure hearing that you may need a court to intervene isn't the most welcome news as a parent but ultimately it protects all of you the most. Especially your daughter.
Is it more paperwork for the school? Probably. Might it be worth it to avoid all the headache with your ex? I don't know, that's up to you.
So just to be clear, it makes more sense for our child to transport expensive and potentially dangerous medicine a block down the road to the school and have them administer it to her as opposed to her walking 100 yards home where I can give it to her and have her dad pick her up at 3:05 PM?
