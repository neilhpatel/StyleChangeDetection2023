In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

That's it. That's how it should go. Every state should have a similar structure. If I'm New York state, and I'm pissed about something that happened in NYC that has Federal jurisdiction, I should have to file in the relevant NYC district, not Buffalo, not Miami--NYC. If it's a state matter, same thing. Not Albany, not Buffalo--NYC.

Consider the "election year SCOTUS appointee" bullshit rule proffered by McConnell and most of the Senate GOP in 2016 for refusing to even grant then DC Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Merrick Garland a hearing; those who didn't tow the party line were threatened in primaries and lose committee chairs or picks, plus probably campaign financing like Kansas Senator Jerry Moran.
1.	Resort to mental gymnastics to excuse the TX venue shopping that could force SCOTUS to step in to protect their own legitimacy.
