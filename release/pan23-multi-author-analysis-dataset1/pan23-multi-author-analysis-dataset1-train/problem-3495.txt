You can also refuse delivery of specific items as well. It would avoid the issue of UPS or whoever from blocking legitimate and important packages. With the obvious downside that you have to be present for the delivery and talk to the driver. (Do it nicely!).
You van also ask you mailman to only deliver things sent to your name (how depends on area - for me it was to tape a list of approved names inside the mail box flap and ask your normal mailman - this is atleast something my mailman told me I could do becauseI kept putting "return to sender" letters in the mail box for months).
Step 2 is a complete waste of time. Even Amazon often can't find these knock-off sellers. If Amazon shut them down, they would just pop back up as a new "company". It's one of the reasons why Amazon itself being sued for the sometimes dangerous crap they allow to be sold on their platform - because if they can't/won't police their sellers, they may become liable themselves.
2. Research the product. Find the vendor. Reach out to the vendor saying you're going to report this to Amazon and include their store name if this doesn't stop.
