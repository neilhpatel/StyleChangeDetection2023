I know it’s a complex situation, but come on, do we really think they don’t know exactly what’s going on and aren’t using the reasoning “if we don’t sell to them someone else will,” as a way to make it easier on Russia.
From food to electronics to steel. That means a blanket ban of exports for an untold amount of items that aren't directly being sold to ally nations. But we're balls deep in exporting everything to any company that doesn't have a blatantly obvious Russian connection. The point is there's no way a capitalist economy will ever stop selling to every company possible regardless of where the products might wind up. Significant legislation would have to be introduced to limit business opportunities for billion dollar companies. The same companies that fatten lawmakers pockets and fund campaigns. This is a legit danger of a capitalist economy during war time. It's intertwined itself in global trade and the only thing that matters to them is profits and sales numbers. Something significant will have to happen and I hope it's done. Time to leash the beast that is American free trade.
