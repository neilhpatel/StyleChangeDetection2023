Let's be careful with our wording about Juneteenth. I've seen lots of tweets today that weren't. It's a celebration of emancipation—but it's the anniversary of neither the beginning of liberation, nor the date when slavery finally was ended in the US.
Higginbotham, Evelyn. Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880-1920 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1994). Honestly, I haven't read this book for a while so pulled this off Amazon: "She addresses the role of black Baptist women in contesting racism and sexism through a “politics of respectability” and in demanding civil rights, voting rights, equal employment, and educational opportunities." I'm pretty sure that this book was the origin of the phrase "respectability politics.".
I unfortunately lack any sources that focus on the Black perspective, but Eric Foner's Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men is a great analysis of the Republican party that will help you understand the Republican position in regards to economics, slavery and race. I also found David M. Potter's The Impending Crisis highly informative regarding the politics of the era. James Oakes' Freedom National, especifically its first chapters, should help regarding the anti-slavery position before the civil war. Finally, Eric Foner's Reconstruction, America's Unfinished Revolution covers most the period, including the Klan terrorism and violent suppression that ultimately ended Reconstruction.
