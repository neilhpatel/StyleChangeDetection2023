Popularity had grown, and grown rapidly - From early 19th century writings about needing to preserve our wildlands an effort was launched around the civil war to begin the thought process of a national park in America. Our first national park, Yellowstone, was created in 1872 as a result of this effort (after removing those pesky inhabitants from their home land to "preserve" it for them). In 1890 we added Yosemite and Sequoia and over the next dozen years added Mt Rainier and Crater Lake. Meanwhile the Forest Reserve Act of 1891 passed and civil war sites were protected as well. The Sierra Club was formed in 1892. The National Audubon Society came in 1905, and congress passed the Antiquities Act of 1906 (that got so much attention surrounding Bears Ears sudden enlargement at the end of Obama and with Zinke wanting to respond by dramatically reducing those protected lands under Trumps admin). Under that act Devils Tower Nat Monument in Wyoming was soon created by Teddy Roosevelt. In 1908 he set aside 818,000 acres included in the Grand Canyon National Monument to preserve the indiginous cultural as well as natural artifacts of the area. All of these loose organizations reported to different federal departments, so in 1916 Wilson created the National Park Service.
2. How much of a backlash did the landholders give? Was there a massive fight to win public favor? Or did most Americans not care or sided with the idea of opening national parks for recreational use?
