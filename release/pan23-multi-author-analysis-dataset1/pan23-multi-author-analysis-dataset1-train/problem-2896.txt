First, it’s unlikely that this person was acting pursuant to a POA because a POA terminates at death. It is possible your father set up a trust prior to death or that his will put assets in trust, and this person was named the trustee. As another person commented you may be entitled to some free legal services through your university. I will note, however, that it’s probably not possible to do a whole lot of investigating without making this person aware you are investigating her. The first step may be to find out whether your father had a will, or whether he executed some trust document prior to his death that put this person in charge of his assets. Getting a copy of whatever document gave her authority to manage the assets will give you a lot of information and may help you in the next direction. Once you find out what document or authority this person was acting pursue it to, you may be able to request an accounting of all the inheritance assets, etc. Good luck.
If you know what city your father died in, find out the name of the county for that city, and then go online to look at the county courthouse probate court case search index to see if your father had a will that was officially probated in court. Or call the courthouse yourself to ask them to check.
