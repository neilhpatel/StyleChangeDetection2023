Each state is responsible for the rules governing their elections. In Arizona for instance, the state CAN process and count mail in ballots before voting has begun but cannot release any of the results thereof until 8pm or until all precincts have reported their in person vote results (whichever is first). This is why you can end up with 'massive dumps' of votes. Arizona is not the only state like this.
The fact that we only had Monday and today to even hear the news about those lists, pore over the names for people we know, and send the link to as many people as possible, on top of the fact that mail-in is used by people who can't vote in person today, so it'll be extremely difficult for them to cure their ballots... it's disgraceful. And the supreme court made their ruling at the eleventh hour so the government couldn't even notify people themselves. How is any of this shit okay in this day in age, in this country?
