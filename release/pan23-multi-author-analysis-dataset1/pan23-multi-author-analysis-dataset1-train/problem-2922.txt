I strongly suggest you contact an employment law attorney in California to find out what your best option is. To my way of thinking, when someone tells you who they are, believe them.
"As an incentive for Professional’s minimum two (2) year commitment, Company agrees to pay Professional an incentive fee of $xxxx (the “Signing Fee”) to be included in Professional’s first check for Services rendered under this Agreement. In exchange for the Signing Fee, Professional agrees, starting on the Effective Date of Services, to provide no less than two (2) year(s) of continuous Services supplying the minimum number of hours/shifts required by this Agreement. In the event, prior to the expiration of two (2) year(s) following the Effective Date of Services, (i) Professional has not continuously supplied Services for the minimum number of hours/shifts required by this Agreement, or (ii) this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than due to termination or expiration of Company’s or an affiliate’s contract with Facilities pursuant to Section 11.1(viii) of this Agreement, Professional shall refund the entire Signing Fee to Company immediately. Professional agrees to refund the Signing Fee within thirty (30) days following the date this Agreement terminates. In the event that Professional does not commence rendering Services under this Agreement for any reason, Professional shall refund the entire Signing Fee immediately. Notwithstanding Section 16 of this Agreement, Professional agrees to pay all attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Company in the collection of the Signing Fee from Professional upon termination of this Agreement.".
In addition to the advice you have gotten so far, a 20% pay cut may allow you to take UI under constructive dismissal if you don't get a new gig immediately upon your contract ending.
