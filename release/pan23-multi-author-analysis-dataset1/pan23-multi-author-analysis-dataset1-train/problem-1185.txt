Saw this recently:”Libertarians are like house cats, thinking they’re independent, but totally relying on a system they don’t understand”. We live in the United States, not separate little countries, although that is what the red states would have everyone believe, even though red states receive more from the fed than blue states, have higher crime rates, lower education results, higher mortality rates and on snd on.
But it's not just my mom. I've noticed that many of the Asian communities around here don't even like other Asian communities. For instance, the Thai people here do not like Filipinos, Koreans, or Chinese. Like, they interact with each other and then behind closed doors, talk shit about each other and say not to trust the other Asian groups.

Interesting. Down here in Florida (or I guess east here in Florida) we have some suburban Asian communities (of which I'm part of) and I've noticed a lot of racism there as well, specifically against blacks and Hispanics. When I brought my ex home like 5 years ago, my mom about had a shit fit because she was half black.
