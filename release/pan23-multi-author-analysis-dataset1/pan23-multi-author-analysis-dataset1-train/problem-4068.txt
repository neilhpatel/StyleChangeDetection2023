I thought Russia was recruiting in Africa, turns out theyâ€™re holding African students studying in Russia hostage with threats of cancelling scholarships/debt trapping to force them to fight in a war.
Exactly. This is also the reason why this genocide was rushed by all accounts. Not so long before war Ukraine signed deals with few companies that would help them gather those resources, since they themselves couldn't. Now that they could, putin suddenly became worried.
Your 2nd choice comes at a large risk, you essentially would need to rely on people's support to survive, you can't just get a taxi and say "bring me to the border of X", flying would be impossible due to cost, essentially hitchhiking is the only option except it's winter time and most people would avoid helping someone who wants to flee the country, and you risk being stuck outside for hours in the freezing cold which can get you killed if you aren't prepared.
Well said. You and I know that, but the "unify the Russias" justification Putin used to drum up his base denied that reality. From his own nationalist perspective, by recruiting foreigners, Putin is a traitor to his own nation.
