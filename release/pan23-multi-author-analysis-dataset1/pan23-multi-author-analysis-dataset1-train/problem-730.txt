That being said, reporting her for animal abuse will not get her out of your parent’s house. If you’re going to make a report, you should do it because you’re genuinely concerned for the health and well-being of the animals - not to try and find a reason for your parents to kick her out (if it isn’t there already,) nor to be vindictive or to retaliate against her. While it’s a perfectly legitimate concern to have, from a legal perspective, her treatment/potential mistreatment of her animals and her residing in your parent’s home are two distinct issues.
I hope you will do great in the future. I am not going to go into the ethics of revenge, but do take into consideration the ramifications a possible revenge can have. Insects can cause property damage, which can cause monetary losses to the owner of the apartment. This can come back to bite you (pun intended).
Depending on where you live, residents can be deemed “tenants” even if they don’t have a formal lease agreement with the homeowners or pay rent; in the absence of a leasing contract, tenancy is often determined based on how long the individual has been living in the home (again, you’ll need to consult your local state/municipal laws to get an exact number).
