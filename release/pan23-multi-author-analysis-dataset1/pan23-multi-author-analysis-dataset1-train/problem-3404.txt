There is a pronounced measure of, for lack of a better term, blood lust in what's left of the Republican party taken over by the tea party nihilists. Everything except favorable treatment for corporations and the 1% is to be destroyed so completely that no brick shall stand upon another. They even find elections, the central pillar of democracy, to be vile impediments to their white nationalist, authoritarian goals. Those who could be part of a policy based alternative to MAGA live in abject fear of the berserker minority and cede influence and power to this unhinged but vocal faction. We really need younger voters to step up and show up to vote these seditionists into oblivion. Let this minority party have no more representation than what actual votes on ballots will provide. Every day a traitor the likes of Jim Jordan is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee is a day that threatens what can still be salvaged of the American Experiment.
