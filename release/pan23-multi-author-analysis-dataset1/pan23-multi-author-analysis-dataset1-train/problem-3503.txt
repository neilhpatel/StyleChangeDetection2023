4. A "spark" - something that creates an initial price rise, attracting the speculative investors. We divide these into technological sparks e.g. the dot-com bubble, and political sparks e.g. \all housing bubbles, the 1720 bubbles.
My personal interests lie in history much more ancient than 1720s, so I tend to pay attention more to things like Mansa Musa's trip to Cairo and the inflation that occured as a result of his largess, and the impact of Spanish gold on the Imperialist-era economy of Europe, but you're saying that the large fall in price comes with no "obvious cause" for it to count as a proper boom-and-bust cycle.
Hi! Thank you for doing this. As I recently watched the film The Big Short, I am curious to get your opinion on what happened surrounding the housing crisis and how it could have been avoided. Also, did we learn from it and are there indicators or procedures to take now if we start heading back in a similar direction before the bubble bursts?
Awesomeness. I did my final report on Colonial Louisiana for my New World class and Jean Law with his stock company was such an entertaining topic.
Probably overreacting. Historically the best times to buy stocks or houses have been in the aftermaths of busts.
