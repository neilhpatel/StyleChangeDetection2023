Mehmet II brought over a hundred cannons of varying sizes to bombard the Theodosian Walls during the Siege of Constantinople, including a handful of incredibly large super-bombards (one surviving cannon still exists, the ,) capable of launching a 600 pound stone ball over a mile. These cannons were indeed successful in breaching the walls, but there were severe drawbacks to using the cannons, as well as strenh in the Theodosian Walls that were unique to the Romans' construction of the walls that caused the siege to drag out over the course of months, rather than days.
Even though the damage from the Ottoman cannons was mitigated by such constraining factors, 2 months of repeated firing at the wall near the San Romano gate was able to open a hole in the wall where the Turks mounted their final assault, eventually able to storm through the breach, capture the gatehouse, and the city quickly fell after the defenders broke and fled.
I actually just posted a comment here on this exact point. Wish I saw your comment before I did, but if you scroll up, I talked a little bit about it up above.
Due the the cube-square law a larger stone shot tends to lose far less of its total energy to air resistance than a smaller one, and though in theory a smaller, denser projectile should be able to penetrate a material much deeper, when the goal is to batter down a wall the maximum penetration isn't so much important as the total amount of material displaced or how large the crater it can make is. Additionally as mentioned since stone shot it lighter it'll tend to put lower peak pressures on the gun when firing, meaning that an iron shot of the same size might require a redesigned gun or for the gunner to settle for a much lower velocity and range to stay safe.
