Typical corporate dem. Responds to the part of the outrage that he feels like addressing, and again, calling constituents whiners. They're playing games. This could have been avoided but Biden, like GOP, will always put corporate interests before the people. He acts incredulous that people are upset and pretends there is no connection between his rejecting concerns of rail workers recently and this accident. He's also been too chicken shit to reinstate regulations Trump undid because he fears backlash from the corporate grubs. Once again, the party wants to decide what you feel, scold you when you point out history and facts. I have said this before and I will say it again. This party is like a domestic abuser. They make promises, offer lots of lip service but when the shit hits the fan, it's voters with the issue, not administration. Then after dismissing you, insulting your ability to make connections, they will soon make promises, offer lots of aesthetics and sparkle, and again not follow through, criticize voters, and around and around the cycle goes. You get what you vote for. And "better than the GOP" is a low, low bar. Stop voting for crap candidates and you won't get crap policy. Period.
Why won't DeWine accept Biden's offer of help? Why won't he declare an emergency? Just to own the libs as far as I can see.
