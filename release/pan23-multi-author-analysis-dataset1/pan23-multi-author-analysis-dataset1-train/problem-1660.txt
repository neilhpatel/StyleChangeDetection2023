Putin is following the dictator's playbook page by page and there are still unfortunately a lot of things he can still set in motion to try to keep his failed, dead and dying terror state afloat for as long as he can. The day of his and his mafia's deaths can't come soon enough.
if we are strictly talking about casualties the problem is much worse for Ukraine whose population is 3 times smaller with even lower birth rate and similar military casualties and tens of thousands of civilian casualties so even if all the 7 million refugees return to the coumtry(a lot already did) they would still have a huge population problem that most people seem to ignore.
I was just thinking about this. Putin could have actually had a really positive legacy in Russian history, and now he will be left with the (well deserved) reputation of the man who pulled the pin on his own grenade.
Beggars can't be choosers. The catastrophic demography in Russia doesn't really offer Putin much of a choice who he can select to declare breeding cattle, especially since most of the childless women can't; don't want to (biologically, mentally or financially) have kids. He might as well (and will most likely) make it a law for every woman of legal age in Russia who can have kids to produce a set amount of offspring for his war machine, in order to get special benefits like this worthless medal or otherwise be fined until they do as told. If they refuse, there are always the penal colonies where there's a 1:50 women/men ratio to blackmail women even further into making children "by free will" instead of being raped in prison.
