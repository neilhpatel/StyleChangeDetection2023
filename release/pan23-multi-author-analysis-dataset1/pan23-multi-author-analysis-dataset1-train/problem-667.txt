The goal? Privatized education controlled by for-profit corporations with a vested interest in turning out citizens with a penchant for the status quo and tacit support of the capitalist structure around them such that changing any parts of the system would be tantamount to treason and apostasy. Re-introduce religious education to further cement a judeo-christian, evangelical flavor to that system.
