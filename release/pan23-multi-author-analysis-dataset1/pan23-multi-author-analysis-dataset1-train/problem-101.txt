In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes. I was making the point that this behavior is not going to go away because there is a system of those in service who continue to push this narrative for their own benefit. I have seen the behavior of some service members out in public and it clearly shows they are happy for the worship. They can be confrontational when they don't get it.
Exactly. Republicans have been trying to sell the message that government can't help anyone, but rather for decades now. Their biggest worry is the Dems will ever get a real chance to show the American people just how good life can be for everyone if they aren't shackled by the Republicans and can actually let the government work for the people for a change. Republicans know if that ever happens they'll never win an election again, so their only hope is to keep breaking the government so they can sell that the government is broken to their voters.
