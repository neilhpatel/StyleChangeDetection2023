While there's nothing legally stopping them from deducing logically who made the report, retaliation of any kind is illegal. Here's a link for some more information:
Edit: let me clarify, OP could file a claim against the company, but any claim based on "intimidation" because his co-worker was dismissed would be considered frivolous and any reasonable Court would dismiss it immediately for lack of standing.
I like this strategy. I did that shjt! What ya gonna do? Canâ€™t do a damn thing because it will be in retaliation. Sounds like an awesome blanket cover. But also not a lawyer.
Although refusal to promote someone can be an adverse employment action and it would unlawful if there was retaliatory motive, others have correctly pointed out there might not be enough evidence available to show unlawful motive, and (unlike an OSHA safety report) you cannot file a whistleblower complaint anonymously. Also, OSHA is insanely backlogged right now, and seem to be doing everything they can to clear their docket of retaliation complaints. Many complaints that I would consider strong have just been outright dismissed for pretty unusual reasons. All that's to say, your mileage may vary with this particular government agency at the moment, which you should factor in to your decision about whether to risk your neck or not.
