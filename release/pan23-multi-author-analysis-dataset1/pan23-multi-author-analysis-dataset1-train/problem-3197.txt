No, he just bribed a bunch of parties in to backing him and got the premiership and the ability to screw with the police and company before he could get sentenced.
They're administrators. And we should think of them just as that. They're administrators for our taxes and for implementing the policies that we want. That our interest are backed by the military, the law and the courts.
It is a related problem though, because Netanyahu is able to partner with fundamentalist religious parties (who don't care about civil liberties or the rule of law) to pre-empt his corruption cases in exchange for inflicting religion on the rest of the public, such as forcing public transportation and stores to close on the sabbath, and allowing majority-fundamentalist communities to discriminate against the non-religious.
LOL. Israel started out as a very far-left socialist state and was run exclusively by the socialist left for its first 30 years of existence. Anarcho-communist agricultural villages called "kibbutzim" were a major part in settling and providing for society at large. Political left and right don't mean exactly the same thing across different places and periods of time.
