Welcome to the world of pre-modern Christian Latin, where conversio does not mean what you think it means.
Fascinating. I wonder if there's any parallel with (at least popular perception of) Zen, in which we get many stories of a teacher telling their student this or that seemingly-nonsensical thing, and the punchline is "in that moment, the student became enlightened"? It seems that the "enlightened" is having something of the same rhetorical function as "converted", and from descriptions it seems they may be referring to a similar sort of mental event.
Thank you! Always love your answers, you always bring up new points I hadn't considered that make me learn so much more than what I ask.
Basically yes. The key in this answer that connects to Zen is "Christian mystics." I've been a Zen Buddhist for 40 years or so. When I read "The Cloud of Unknowing," (for example) it speaks to me quite clearly.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Confessiones became exceptionally popular among medieval monks and nuns, who often either sought or actually experienced a similar "turning upwards/sinking down into." (...And there were plenty of them who didn't care, of course.).
