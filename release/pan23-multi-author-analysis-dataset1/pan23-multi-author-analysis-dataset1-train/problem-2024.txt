I suppose you could say that there are two separate questions here, one being whether common soldiers might be permitted to kill high nobility on the battlefield, and the other being whether or not they would be allowed to kill a member of the high nobility after the battle had ended, which is essentially the situation at the end of the movie. The need to answer both questions comes from a number of different sources describing Agincourt as the battle where chivalry died in the mud, suggesting that it was substantially different from all previous battles and that the killing of greater nobles was something unusual at the time.
I liked this movie. But I hated the battle of Agincourt - since it seemed very off from what I've read, watched etc regarding that battle before. I liked the siege of the first castle, where basically they just sit around and nothing in particular basically happens except for them throwing rocks - but I was under the impression that they brought cannons with them, as some kind of first for the english and medieval battles? Any thoughts?
He could have paid the ransom, but doing so against the king's express orders, combined with rumours that the elder Mortimer had allowed himself to be captured and was working with the rebels, would have most likely have led to the Percys being labelled as rebels, with all the loss of land and outlawry that came with it.
Jesus christ. I think the movie just lacked that... horror. It turned into a not-as-impactful moment in the movie. I was basically longing for that to be shown in a movie... and they didn't.
