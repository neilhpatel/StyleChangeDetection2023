I know that itâ€™s not good to deal in hypotheticals, but if the Japanese had attacked the soviets during the time of Barbarossa, instead of attacking to the south and the western allies, would it have been successful?
So could Japan have feasibly conducted an attack that would have slammed the soviets at this point instead of going toward Australia? Or is this not likely either?
To summarise, while there was a strong drive within the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) for war with the Soviet Union, the war in China had kept the majority of the IJA tied down, while--by 1941--the consensus among Japanese policy makers was solidifying around the Southern Operation, which would involve attacks on the American, British, and Dutch colonial holdings in southeast Asia. The Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, concluded in April 1941, would serve to protect Japan's northern flank while it went south. When Germany embarked on Operation Barbarossa, some in Japanese leadership pressed for an immediate war against the Soviet Union (including Foreign Minister Matsuoka, who had just negotiated the nonagression pact with the Soviets), but it quickly became obvious to Japan that the Soviet Union was in no danger of collapsing in 1941, and that Japan should avoid being tied down in another large scale war on the Asian mainland, unless it was to pick up the pieces in the event of a Soviet collapse. To this end, the Japanese welcomed the German attack on the Soviet Union, as it basically ensured the Soviets would be unable to attack Japan as it embarked on its war with the Western powers.
