One of the problems with that is a taser's most effective range is about 10-15 feet away, well within the range at which an unarmed assailant can charge an officer. Similarly, a taser doesn't stop a charging assailant - they still have momentum. The best way to tase someone is to shoot them in the back, because this allows the electrical charge to go across the back muscles and not across the heart. It also means it's much harder for the person to charge you because they would have to turn around to do it.
