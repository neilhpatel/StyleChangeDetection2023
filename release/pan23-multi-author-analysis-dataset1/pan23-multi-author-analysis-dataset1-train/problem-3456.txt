But back to the horses and battlefields: the simple answer then is that cavalry wasn't constantly charging/galloping, and fatigue management was as much a concern for cavalry as it was for infantry units. Both could trade speed for endurance or vice versa, which makes for crucial choices in warfare of any period, as good maneuvering alone could already win you entire battles. An enemy on a hill is a textbook case where the 'wrong' approach would be to charge troops (infantry or cavalry) up the hill and then fight. The added exertion and lack of rest gives a decisive advantage to the defender on the hill. This type of fatigue (e.a. "being winded") for both humans and horses is of shorter duration than one might think, and a unit that is given a short pause may easily find itself back up to near-normal fighting strenh, but nonetheless it stands to reason that both infantry and cavalry didn't sprint without good reason and would rather pace themselves. Cavalry, it should be noted, has a far higher capacity to cover intermediate distances at a high pace than humans, giving them a distinct advantage in maneuver at the scale of minutes to single digit hours ^4; a heavily loaded horse can still cover up to 2-3 times as much distance as a human in one hour.
I'm not sure how supportable this is. Archaeological and artistic evidence indicates that the medieval warhorse was not much larger on average than modern riding horses: perhaps 15 hands or a bit more on average, but strongly and muscularly built. Certainly they were not draft horses.
