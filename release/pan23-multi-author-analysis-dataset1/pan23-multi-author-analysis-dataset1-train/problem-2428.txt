How much was it representative to broad beliefs in ancient Gaul or the La Tenian horizon (that is the only regions and peoples where Druidic presence is actually attested for in Antiquity) is of course difficult to say, but it seems otherwise fitting enough to other sources.
Of course, it doesn't tells us much about its ancient role in La Tenian religion and the likely regional differences, and we ought to be extremely cautious in equalling Ogmios with Oghma as if they weren't separated by centuries and hundred of kilometres (it's probable that while cognates, they come from a diverging proto-Celtic source) but linguistic and epigraphic comparativism could stress the role of these deities in marking the world-balance as far as oaths and cosmological relations are concerned.
Is it possible that it's an idiom of some kind? I read Alexander remarking that they are 'braggarts' and think that the sky falling is a sly way of saying 'nothing' -- though I'm sure my interpretation is colored by Chicken Little and modern understanding of the concept of sky.
