But then OP deleted their question.
What you remarked when it comes to the language (it used informal, everyday expression as "rigoler" when it wasn't the norm, for instance) is part of this connection to popular culture, why Astérix (and its good translations) connected with people, and why Goscinny was basically the mid-wife of a matured comics culture in France with Pilote.
O.J. Padel in a rather obscure work suggests that Geoffrey of Monmouth was drawing on Cornish tradition for his early reference to Arthur: ‘Geoffrey of Monmouth and Cornwall,’ Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies, 8 (Winter 1984), pp. 1–28.
