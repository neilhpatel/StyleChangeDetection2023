So the act of crossing through the crosswalk isn't enough to consider me a pedestrian? I thought the issue was that everyone stopped and didn't know who should go first.
373.08 RIDING REGULATIONS. It shall be legal to ride a bicycle upon a sidewalk, street or public way, or upon any path set aside for the exclusive use of bicycles, subject to the following:
(a)Every person operating a bicycle upon a roadway shall ride as near to the right side of the roadway as practicable obeying all traffic rules applicable to vehicles and exercising due care when passing a standing vehicle or one proceeding in the same direction. (ORC 4511.55(A)).
(1)   Without due regard for the safety and rights of pedestrians and drivers and occupants of all other vehicles, and so as to endanger the life, limb or property of any person while in the lawful use of the streets or sidewalks or any other public or private property;.
I hope you are alright! You can file an insurance claim through the auto insurance policy for the repair of your bicycle. If you also have injuries, medical, or ambulance bills you can file a claim for that as well. I'd check your auto insurance to see if you have medical pay (medpay) to cover the ambulance costs.
