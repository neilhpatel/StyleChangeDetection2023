In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Maybe. I make ads, the 180 most Rs turned by 2018 is whiplash inducing because the people there are smitten with the exclusivity and power. Regardless of Trump's dropping ratings, they're all worried about being primaried. And in the past 4 years as opposed to the 10 before it, they aren't moving to the center (campaign wise) to get a bigger base. Making people mad enough to vote or inspiring apathy is the only play they're running for the most part.
The whole point of most PACs is to comment apathy, as they legally can't tell you to vote. They can however spew bullshit that passes a lawyer's small test as long as they say "call so and so and make your voice heard".
