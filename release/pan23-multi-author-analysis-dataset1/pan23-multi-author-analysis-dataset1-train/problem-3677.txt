After the Spanish Armada, the English decided to counterattack, and they did so the very next year. When the English fleet came with the intent of destroying the 100 or so ships that still remained from the Armada, they could not get to Santander, where the Spanish fleet was under repair, so they tried to find another place to invade and where to set a foothold: Coru√±a, an important port in Galicia, but with relatively few people (around 4,000).
Fantastic story, and very well written! I found myself holding my breath as I wondered if the women and the army would prevail. I'm glad they did. I would never want to fight a mother.
According to Appian, three streets (about 7m width from excavations) led from the Agora to the Byrsa (the inner citadel of Carthage) flanked on each side by tall buildings each six stories high, it also contained several side streets each of roughly 5m width. The men who had just plundered the Temple attacked but a slew of missiles from said buildings stopped them. The legionnaires unable to progress attacked some of the buildings and slowly went floor to floor. When they had reached the top, they laid planks of wood from the roof of a building to the adjacent one.
