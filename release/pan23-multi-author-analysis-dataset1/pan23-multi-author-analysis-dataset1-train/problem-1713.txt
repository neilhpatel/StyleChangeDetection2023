I don’t understand how one “makes sure the food is good” when they leave the store and then magically all your food is bad when you get home… if it was fine enough for you to check the food and think “this is good to get and isn’t expired and doesn’t feel or smell rotten” then what makes you think the store is responsible when it suddenly isn’t fresh when you get home? Like, nothing in your story is making sense.
That was really rude and it seems like you're the one who's still living at home with Mommy and Daddy I've been on my own for 26 years and I know this never used to happen a few years ago I've always used the same product and I even used to leave it sitting out for hours and it never went bad like it is now and I never ever leave it out now.
P.s. I find it very hard to believe you’ve lost several thousand dollars over the past two years due to expired food. And if you have, you’d basically have to be actively searching for expired products and stacking your cart full. Personally, it feels like you’re fishing for more money than you’ve lost, from a company that owes you nothing. Just a reminder to you, something being incredibly annoying or inconvenient does not make it illegal.
