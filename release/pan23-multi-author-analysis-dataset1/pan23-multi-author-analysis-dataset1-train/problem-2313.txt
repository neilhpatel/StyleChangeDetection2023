Learning about the history of aggressively expansionist empires would teach you that this is only possible if conquered/occupied peoples are offered a “buy-in”, some meaningful improvement in the quality of their lives, including infrastructure, basic social services, domestic economic growth and prosperity, and a reliable and fair system of justice. But the Russian Empire never did modernization well, and its current wanna-be emperor, being the head of a desperate and dying petrol-state, doesn’t seem like the “learn from the past” type, so they’re probably not going to start now.
Seriously. These questions just betray a lack of understanding of the depravity of Russian power. It doesn’t matter how illogical it is. That has no meaning.
Nuclear retaliation is the ultimate deterrent. Nobody in the world wants that. That's the power of being a nuclear nation. It doesn't matter of the nation had 1 or 100, nobody is going to fuck with a country that could potentially get a nuke into ones of their cities. That should come as a surprise to no one.
