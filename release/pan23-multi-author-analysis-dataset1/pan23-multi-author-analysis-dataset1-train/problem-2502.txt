Following WW1 large parts of Europe had their borders redrawn because of the fall of the Austria-Hungarian Empire. Czechoslovakia was founded and included the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, which was home to millions of ethnic Germans.1 Part of Upper-Silesia was allocated to Poland, which meant millions of Germans now lived in Polish territory.2 In order to protect these minority groups Czechoslovakia and Poland, at the behest of the League of Nations, signed multilateral treaties which protected the rights of minority groups in their countries.3 In the treaties Czechoslovakia and Poland declared that they would give equal rights to all ethnic groups in their country after the transfer of territory. This was also reflected in The Treaty of Versailles:
The possibilities for an unscrupulous opportunist in these regions were endless, and it didn't require particularly detailed knowledge of local conditions either. You might hook up with a Revolutionary Guard group, slap on some suitably official-looking armbands, travel up to the borderlands, and just start expropriating property for yourself. You could also try to get yourself selected leader of the local National Committee (the new village council) which would give you an enormous amount of power over all the confiscated property in the village. You might not be able to hang on to all this property or political power in the long run, though, since the Czechoslovak state wants to settle this ideologically, strategically, and economically sensitive region with hard-working patriots, not self-serving scoundrels like you. Accusations of stealing or improperly dealing with national property were very potent in postwar Czechoslovakia (and not only in the borderlands). What would happen to you ultimately would depend very much on your own personal situation and connections, and the specific dynamics in the place where you settled.
