Police, who are usually MAGAs if not outright Nazis, going house to house doing whatever they want. Yes that is certainly a recipe for people to feel "safe in their own homes." Do you hear yourself?
Nah, there are plenty of ways to interpret the second amendment, it’s really not that robust, if profits and lobbyist dollars suddenly dried up or went elsewhere, we would see a change, but there’s too much money to be made for people to consider goofy things like public safety or responsibility.
It's not hard to say what will happen at all. Even if this makes it past the court system in Illinois, the federal courts will nullify it because it flagrantly T-bones both _Heller_ and _Bruen_. Furthermore, it will allow the SC to set the precedent that ALL assault weapons bans are unconstitutional because they criminalize guns which are in common use for self-defense and other lawful purposes.
Hard to say what will happen here. If the legislation indeed was passed without the approval of the state congress then they might have a point to remove it.
However I honestly would kind of doubt that this would have gotten the governor's approval for passage without the state congress' approval.
