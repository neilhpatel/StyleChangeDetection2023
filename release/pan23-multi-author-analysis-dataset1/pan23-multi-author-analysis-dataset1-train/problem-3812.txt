If you're interested in the politics surrounding Henry Tudor's rise to the throne, I highly recommend Hicks' book as a more comprehensive discussion of the various factions in the Wars of the Roses (a term which is itself a byproduct of the Tudor propagandistic tradition). Likewise, Henry VIII's Divorce: Literature and the Politics of the Printing Press by J. Christopher Warner is a great breakdown of the Tudor propaganda apparatus under Henry VIII.
Thank you so much! this provides aspects I didn't initially recognize when researching the topic. If I had a diamond medal I would definitely give it you.
Moreover, Henry Tudor's political position was also weak. When Henry crossed the Channel in 1485, the Lancastrian faction to which he belonged had essentially already lost. Henry VI mysteriously died in 1471 and all of the other male-line members of the House of Lancaster were either already dead or had been killed in battle. Henry Tudor became Henry VII not because he was the best candidate, but largely because he was the only real alternative to Richard III left. His primary supporters were the rebellious Yorkists and crypto-Lancastrians that opposed Richard as well as the king of France. To many Englishmen, Henry would likely have been an upstart Welshman leading an army of traitors and even worse, the French.
