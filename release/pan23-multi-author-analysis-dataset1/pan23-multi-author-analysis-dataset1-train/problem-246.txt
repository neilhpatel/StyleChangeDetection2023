Yeah for sure. Deflate the tires for working class people and not the companies who are responsible for majority of the pollution. These activists continue to be more stupid with every “action” they take. Just increasing aggravation until some folks will actually go around looking to aggravate them by intentionally wasting resources or even harassing them. This seems like the most useless self-congratulatory “climate action” they could have done. What a joke.
I feel the need to point out we are on track to ALL DIE and that the protests will get more extreme and eventually you will be on the same side as them, begging for water or shelter in the face of an alien climate, doing anything you can to wake the remaining people up from their sleep walk off the cliff of existence.
No. All this will accomplish is making the activists targets. People are very protective of their vehicles and will just think it is an attack on them rather than a nuisance. Maybe a handful will remember when it's time to get a new vehicle. Though a majority will just be like "wow what a bunch of cunts, guess I'll grab my tire inflator or call roadside assistance" and then move on with their lives.
