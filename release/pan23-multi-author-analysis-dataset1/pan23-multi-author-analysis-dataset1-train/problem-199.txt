Wow... This is off base as you can get. Snap out of the bubble. Trump is looking more like the 2016 self and that isn't good for democracy and the Democratic Party.

Across every location and demographic, reporters encountered a range of attitudes toward Trump’s candidacy, generally falling into four broad categories: There were voters who vowed to stick with Trump no matter what; those who strongly supported Trump but were open to other options; others who were more eager to see a new nominee; and finally, some voters who said they were finished with Trump and couldn’t see themselves voting for him again.
Eh. You’re giving them too much credit. It’s more a matter of internalization. They won’t ever cop to the fact that he’s a liar & a criminal so they pivot to acknowledging they would like a candidate without all of the controversy & unfavorables that Trump comes with when, in actuality, they’ve accepted that they can’t win with Trump because the guy just keeps fucking losing so they’ll cling into the next guy who comes along & feels exactly like Trump.
