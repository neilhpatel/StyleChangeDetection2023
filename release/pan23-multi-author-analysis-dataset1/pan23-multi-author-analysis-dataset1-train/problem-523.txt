Because this has been going for a while, I wanted to add a quick commentary here on this matter: The state of research on this is far from a concensus and is structured in a similar manner to the debate playing out here. While first works on the matter (also cited in this thread) have been published in recent years, this is still very muhc playing out and far from a concensus to my knowledge. Similarly, with debates raging at the moment on the importance of colonial policy and precedence for Nazi Germany policy, it will most likely remain a contentious topic for several years to come and while we see positions playing out as we see them playing out in this thread, a sort of consensus and the matter and with it an answer that approaches anyhting close to definitive is still somewhat off in the future.
This is a bold claim, and one that's completely incorrect. The Nazis absolutely were heavily influenced by American colonialism, were driven by a necessity to replicate what they saw as its success, and this is clear in far more than just passing references.
I disagree with you here. One aspect of US influence on the Nazis which you did not touch on was the reservation system and American genocide of Native Americans. John Toland wrote in his biography of Hitler the following:
The Holocaust is a continuum/culmination of previous Antisemitism and Jewish Persecution. No influence whatsoever from the US, and the only purpose behind such claims is to downplay and erase the long history of Antisemitism.
