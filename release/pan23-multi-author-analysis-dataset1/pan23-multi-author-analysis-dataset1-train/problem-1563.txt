I have this follow-up: I have heard (wrongly or not - I do not know) that Alexander is (was?) known in Persian culture as the “daemon king”, i.e. a personification of evil. And that his conquest started a nasty period of destruction and war for the locals. That the local zoroastrian population had to put up with their new Greek-speaking overlords, who saw them as savages and were, generally, quite unpleasant as rulers. Is there any truth to this?
That said, as I tried to make clear in my other post, Alexander's empire was never an empire in the sense we understand it; many regions would have submitted only nominally, or negotiated a qualified surrender of autonomy. Especially since Alexander took no time to establish a lasting imperial administration, his conquests will have actually looked like a patchwork of semi-autonomous states and communities that had simply (and literally) chosen the path of least resistance.
P.S. - As this is my first post here of any significance I just wanted to thank /u/Iphikrates again for their post as it gave me a great format to follow!
The answer by /u/Iphikrates along with his previous post is fantastic. I wanted to add at least one point that I don't think was mentioned very much here or in the previous linked post to do with Alexander's choice of carefully choosing the order in which he occupied territory.
