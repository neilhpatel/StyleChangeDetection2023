Serbia was actively committing multiple forms of genocide against Bosniaks, Bosnian Croats, and Kosovan Albanians, committed mass murders of Bosnian men, raping women and children, and bombing to the ground all the mosques that they still to this day try to deny ever existed despite the mountains of evidence proving they did. The ICC ruled that the Serbs perpetrated genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has produced several reports and documentaries that go over the various crimes against humanity, genocide, and cultural genocide perpetrated that are worth watching/reading.
No, I'm not. I've had and am having my fair share of "brain washing" from everyone in that country. People pro Vučić making up stuff and people against Vučić making up stuff. Other examples but really difficult to explain unless you go in the Balkans and see it for yourself. That's just how it is and I'm not taking any side if I can't see the floor with my eyes on any of them. I'm hugging the fence, I don't care.
Exactly. People here don’t understand that no matter what they do they’ll be fucked. There is no right decision that’ll be good for the people living there.
