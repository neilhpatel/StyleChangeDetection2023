The issue isn't that doctors don't want to pay for med school or work in Canada. The issue is that there simply aren't enough spots available in Canadian med schools, and there aren't enough residency spots available at hospitals for those who get through med school in the first place, forcing a large percentage of med school graduates in Canada to go to a foreign country to complete their residency, and then when they come back to Canada, they need to go through a lenhy process to prove that they're actually qualified to be a doctor in Canada because most foreign credentials aren't accepted at face value.
I think about this fairly often. Does nationalists health care ruin pay doctors could get if it wasn't privatized? I mean I know individuals in portugal who become MDs and make shit for 5-10 years then they finally make 100k salary a year.
"Specialization training" is called residency. Not only is it free, doctors get paid to do it because it is actual work. In fact it is the back bone to many large health systems, having cheap labor in resident physicians.
