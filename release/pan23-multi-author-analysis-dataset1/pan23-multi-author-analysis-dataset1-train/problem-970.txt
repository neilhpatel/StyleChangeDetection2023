As for your second question, it's a bit of an emotional story. My heart dog passed from lymphoma during the first year of my MA. Originally, I came into my MA studying the Civil War as that was what I had focused on during undergrad. However, after losing Scout I started to think about how I could research animals in history. Before becoming a history major, I really wanted to be a veterinary technician as I have just always loved animals. I soon found out that I am awful at science. .
What an interesting niche I always crack up at the image of a Coast Guard PO3 dog handler screaming profusely at an IDless George Marshall when he and his wife unknowingly violated curfew on a Florida beach - or did the author of that get the dog part of the story wrong since they were only in California? - during the first night of his only vacation during the war (which he took only because he received a direct order to do so.) Luckily, a few minutes later his lieutenant showed up and fortunately for all involved recognized exactly who he'd been summoned to arrest.
4.	Dogs and handlers had a very special bond. We think of Marines being unable to cry, but there were definitely tears shed when a dog was killed. The dog was your partner, and your buddy but they were also a fellow soldier. A dog was assigned two handlers and they were the only ones who interacted with the dogs. The handler was responsible for feeding, grooming and bathing, and any general upkeep of their dogs so it helped increase the bonds. For those who served with dogs, they were usually given a role that was focused solely on the dogs unless they were transferred to a different combat unit.
