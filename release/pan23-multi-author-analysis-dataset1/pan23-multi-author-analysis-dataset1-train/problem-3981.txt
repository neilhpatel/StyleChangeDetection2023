Different from the Arabs, Iranian nationalism always had a nuanced relation with Islam, because the Persian history and culture long predates Islam, you can even say that Islam is a religion of the colonizers. The ayatollah almost view himself and his religion entirely above the civilization of Iran. Therefore this seemingly nationalist call from the Sunni cleric almost have some nuanced undertone to it, he's calling for a nation united under nationalism/patriotism instead of Islam.
1. Iran has always been called Iran since the beginning of its history, derived from Old Persian "Aryānām xšaθra/xšaça" which became "Ērānšahr" in Middle Persian (Sassanid period), which then became "Īrānšahr" in New Persian/Modern Persian and got simplified to just "Iran" (Irān/Irân).
OP doesn’t have a clue. This Imam is from the largest school of Sunni Islam in the Arab world, and plenty of Arabs and non-Arab muslims have called for a nationalist interpretation of Islam, with its recent intellectual origins in Egypt, taking influence from France (see Rifaa al-Tahtawi). The Imam and Iranians aren’t arguing for any ideas that haven’t existed in the Muslim or even Arab world before. Those ideas were just drowned out by fundamentalist reactionism to colonialism and instability.
2. Persia is just one of many regions of Iran, which corresponds to modern Fars. Outside sources (that is, primarily the Ancient Greeks) simply confused the names and thought that "Persia" applied to the whole country instead of just that particular region.
