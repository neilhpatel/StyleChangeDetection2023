Yes i am aware but i already had been penalized for that back in march and since it was my first offense, they told me i had to pay a reinstatement fee and carry sr22 for 4 years, which I did and am doing both, they said open and shut case. I am confused how they are trying me for this again months later after i already did everything i was supposed to do. Does that make sense?
If the other driver's insurer said that all you had to do is pay the deductible and you can prove that through written communications or because the call was recorded (insurers regularly record calls), you may have a good defense to any debt collection action on the basis that you settled or came to what is termed an "accord and satisfaction." If that was simply your understanding, however, or it was not clear in the communications, you are probably liable for the full amount of damages. Given what you said about the amount and your age and income, I'd ask any attorney you consult about whether you should consider filing for bankruptcy to clear this debt quickly so it isn't hanging over your head for the next 7 or 8 years.
