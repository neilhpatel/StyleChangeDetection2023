"Uncle Deadbeat... You can either accept $XXX and leave now or you will be evicted and you'll have nothing. Your choice.".
Yes this is correct, a lot of cases like this are not being pursued, cases being dropped (I'm repeating what a LEO told me a few months ago) definitely make the car inaccessible however you can the police may pursue it to get it back but do be prepared for charges to get dropped not that it's right and follow all eviction notices/steps eventually if he doesn't leave hopefully a sheriff will haul him out!
You're probably right. I kept going back and forth on the meaning and decided to post anyway just to be safe. I mean, any time a lawyer can give an opinion on anything, we all jump on it, right? üòÅ.
It's possible to do it yourself, but it can be a bit complicated for a person who doesn't regularly do evictions, and if you make a mistake, you might have to start the eviction process all over again. So it's best to dig a little deeper for the money needed to let a professional do it.
