About that Soviet bear example, do we know if the people in the culture literally could not understand that logic? Or could it have been that they did not trust thinking in terms of "take x for granted, therefore...", especially when coming from a foreigner they've never met before? Or that they simply weren't familiar with the scholarly norm of using toy problems, or did not recognize being interrogated by a foreigner as a situation appropriate for a toy problem? If an alien visited Earth and walked up to me and said, after much difficulty in translation, "In a certain part of the Martian ice caps, purple cows thrive. Your friend visited that area of the ice caps. What color were the cows?" I might legitimately respond, especially if I'm feeling frustrated with this alien, "Uhm... Purple cows don't thrive on Mars. Why don't you ask him?".
So... the full answer is that this wasn't really understood until the 20th century, when mathematicians like Banach [1] defined operator theory and pure math became a coherent and self-propelling academic discipline in its own right, where previously it was more the domain of individual researchers.
