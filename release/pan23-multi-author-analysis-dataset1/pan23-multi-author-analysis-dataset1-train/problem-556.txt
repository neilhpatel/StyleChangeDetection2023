For further reading, I would suggest Richard Cordingly's "Under the Black Flag" and his edited version of the 1724 classic "A General History of the Murders and Robberies of the Most Notorius Pirates", Angus Konstam's "A History of Piracy", Colin Woodard's highly entertaining "Republic of Pirates", Peter Leeson's acclaimed "The Invisible Hook", and, for a view of early piracy off North Africa, Godfrey Fisher's "Barbary Legend".
The skull and crossbones has its roots in very real history. The first reference to it under the name "Jolly Roger" comes to us from Charles Johnson's A General History of the Pyrates, a contemporary (Albeit fanciful) account of many of the most prolific pirates of the age. As you said yourself, there were variations upon this theme, and the Jolly Roger was far from universal. Its prominence in modern media likely comes from its simplicity and its very explicit meaning. The Jolly Roger is memorable, easily re-creatable and, for lack of a better word, concise in its messaging. A hanged man, an hourglass, a harpoon through a heart, all of these symbols were used and were tied to the great infamy of their users, but a skull and bones? A child can understand your intentions!
Carrying a distinct flag was part of the agreements for those nations to issue commissions or letters of marque or reprisal (the document that identified you as a privateer with government permission to attack and seize enemy ships, as opposed to a criminal pirate).
From the victims' point of view, it was important to know if an attacker was a pirate vessel, as opposed to a privateer (a private vessel operating under a government licence to attack the ships of a particular opposing nation) or a military ship such as the Spanish coast guard. The latter two were constrained by law against killing the crew of victim ships unless they resisted, while pirates operated according to any or no rules, as they preferred.
