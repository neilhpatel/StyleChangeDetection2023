This is why the UN is horseshit. China is intentionally wiping out an ethnicity, people are dying in African countries to murderous warlords but Israel gets not only more condemnations than anyone, more than all other countries combined? lol.
That's an incredibly difficult argument to make when Russia literally just invaded Ukraine and Iran has been suppressing protests with violence for the back half of the year.
2. There are 50 Muslim majority countries in the world compared to 1 Jewish state. 2 billion Muslims compared to 15 million Jews.
The human rights council is made up of Arab countries that have flagrant human rights abuses who for the most part still don't recognize Israels right to exist, countries include Qatar who killed more migrant slaves then Israelis/Palestinians combined who have died in the past 25 years, Saudi Arabia and UAE who has killed many times more civilians in Yemen then even Qatar, Afghanistan, Algeria, among others who have not only historically persecuted their Jewish populations but are committing way more egregious violations. It is because they hate the Jews.
