I'm in northern CT and it's been kind of tough listening to everyone praise the nice weather lately without considering why it's unseasonably warm. Personally, it makes me sad when I think about why I'm sleeping with my windows wide open in November. Never in my life of living in New England have I been able to have windows open at night in November. Like you said, it's back to more autumnal appropriate temperatures today, but I bet people will complain that they miss the warm weather.

Seriously. It is just absolutely ridiculous to act like China is a horrible it's horrible dirty monster that we have nothing to do with when so much of that pollution is driving the industry that is making goods we buy.
I grew up in the 80s. WE WERE WARNED. We we all fucking told this would happen. The people in charge didn't fucking care. It's so fucking frustrating to be the "find out" generation now when we were too young while the older generations were "fucking around".
