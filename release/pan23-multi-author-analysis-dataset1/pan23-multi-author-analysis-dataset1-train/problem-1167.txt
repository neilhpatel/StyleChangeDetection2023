Regardless of where gasoline is from it is always more expensive than electric. However, it generally doesn't compete, unless you have a hybrid car you don't have a choice what fuel you buy. The longer gas is at a cheapish price, the more people will buy gas vehicles. Consider the kind of person that buys new vehicles every 5 years, they don't have to consider fuel costs for the life of the vehicle, just the time they own it, so a slightly cheaper gas vehicle will be cheaper for them than an EV. The rest of us who are stuck buying used cars are stuck buying gas cars cause that's what's available. This will absolutely delay the energy transition.
