This comment is in general an excellent overview of the Bennets' circumstances. However, I want to correct a few things in the above quotation: while Longbourn would indeed have passed to Mr. Bennet's son, entailment is not mere male primogeniture. An entail is a legal instrument of inheritance, but in Jane Austen's day was also used as a common reference to an instrument known as a strict settlement; the point of either entailment or strict settlement was to mark out inheritance and property rights in very specific terms to specific people, rather than just general inheritance.
I know. I said that. Mr Bennet was an esquire (think like a squire, basically; one step down from a knight). Nowadays we think “Esquire” means lawyer, but words change over time and Mr Bennet wasn’t a lawyer (or a barrister), but was an Esquire.
Mrs Bennet’s father was lawyer, but not an esquire (which was gentry) or a barrister (which we’d think of as a “lawyer” today). He’d be like a bookkeeper who also does estate planning/family law stuff that doesn’t require him to go to court.
