In the interest of not posting any identifying information, let's say the group they work for doesn't have a name like 'Joe Smith Realty'. It's a generic name like 'Awesome Realty under Big Realty Company.' BUT when I looked up both of their license numbers, both were listed with the same supervisor number and with 'Awesome Realty under Big Realty Company' as their supervisor name. Is this what I'm looking for?
Certain defenses, like fraudulent misrepresentation, can still survive, but this case doesn't really seem like it would fall under that, particularly since you were already on notice to the issue and could have discovered it during the walkthrough if you exercised due care based on your prior knowledge.
Thank you for the reply. No it was not disclosed at the time of purchase. I was fully aware she was a realtor, but the only information I was given was that she owned the house and was the seller but that her daughter and her family were currently inhabiting it.
Don't do this. You don't know about his agreement with his company, whether this would be in violation of their rules or not.
