NAL but time is of the essence here if the guy has been using your mom's property for 20 years. That's the amount of time that a person has to occupy property in Massachusetts in order to potentially have a right to the property based on adverse possession (that's the legal term to describe what's going on here [sometimes referred to as squatter's rights.]).
No title policies will cover their insured's going after their neighbors for adverse possession, they universally include language to the effect of "we don't cover anything outside the legal description".
You might be out of luck already. If the fence was already up when your family bought the land almost 20 years ago, it has probably been up for more than 20 years.
If the survey does not show the fence on your property, that might be your evidence that the fence was put up or moved less than 20 years ago.
You will probably need to figure out if the previous owner gave the neighbor permission to build the fence on the property. In that case, the permission given by the previous owner would probably undermine the adverse possession claim.
