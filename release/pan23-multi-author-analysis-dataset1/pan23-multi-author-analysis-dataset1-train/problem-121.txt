A. The tenant may assert that there exists upon the leased premises a condition that constitutes a material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or with provisions of law or that, if not promptly corrected, will constitute a fire hazard or serious threat to the life, health, or safety of occupants of the premises, including (i) a lack of heat or hot or cold running water, except where the tenant is responsible for payment of the utility charge and where the lack of such heat or hot or cold running water is the direct result of the tenant's failure to pay the utility charge; (ii) a lack of light, electricity, or adequate sewage disposal facilities; (iii) an infestation of rodents; or (iv) the existence of paint containing lead pigment on surfaces within the dwelling, provided that the landlord has notice of such paint.
Yes, it’s very weird. We run off of a water well that has its on power. I’m so sorry I forgot to mention our laundry room works also. It must be connected to the same circuit as the porch (idk.) Our a/c is in the laundry room so it works. Also our stove works. It’s on a different type of outlet. What is not working are any other outlets in the rest of the house and no lights are working. I’m very grateful that all of these things are working, but we can’t live like this. I’m cooking meals with battery operated lights and candles, tucking my kids carrying a battery operated lights.
