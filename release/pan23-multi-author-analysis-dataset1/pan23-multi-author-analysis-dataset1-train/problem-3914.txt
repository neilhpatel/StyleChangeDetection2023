I've often heard and read of him doing the same in language terms (complaining about people aspirating consonants in a 'Greek' fashion - so saying pulcher when the 'proper' Roman pronunciation was pulcer) but can't actually find the citation, other than indirectly in an old TAPA article.
Ok. Cool. I think we're basically on the same page here, I was mighty confused before. Wasn't quite sure what you were getting at.
Admirers of neoterics (Horace, Propertius, Virgil, Ovid etc): Follow the neoteric precedent but now use the sinister = sinister symbolism in works that become unquestionably official and canonical.
Ok? That's exactly what I am suggesting, that an existing vulgar idiom entered verse first, by means of the neoteric Greek-influenced elegaic form, and then from there spread to "proper" prose. I'm not sure why pre-Catullan poets matter very much. There's so little surviving poetry between Catullus and Terence and Plautus, and pretty much all of that is neoteric anyway. Any argument about what poets were doing in that intervening space really can't hold much weight, we have no idea. We know that the Greek perspective appears first in verse, and only becomes common in prose around the time of Pliny and Tacitus. We know that in its earliest uses in verse and oratory it requires no explanation, but is assumed to be obvious--that it is so in oratory seems like a bit of a smoking gun.
