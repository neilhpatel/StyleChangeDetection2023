Not really. With drones changing the dynamics of aerial deployment, you still want the troops on the ground to look out for aerial targets, and you want them to have the capacity to take those targets down themselves (because by the time you call in for support, that drone might have caused some sort of damage). All your air dominance flying a million F-22s still won't stop Johnny McInfanty from launching his quadcopter with a grenade strapped to it and having the capacity to both recon your position safely and kill something.
I do love my ice cream. I feel my point still stands however. These are for bad days. I'd rather have one and not need it because the USAF is doing their job perfectly than need it because something has gone wrong (a notoriously common thing in warfare) and not have it because we expected bad days to never happen.
So, what to do? The solution was to use SMAW rockets, one to punch a hole through the concrete and another with a thermobaric ware head to collapse the building.
