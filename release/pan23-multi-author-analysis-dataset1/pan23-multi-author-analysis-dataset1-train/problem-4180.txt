Why everyone didn't just jump ahead to box magazines in 1855 is a good question. We could also ask why there weren't armed flying drones in 1980. When the British adopted the Lee Metford, the US was making plans to finally abandon the single-shot black powder Trapdoor Springfield. Sometimes technology doesn't leap.
Ah, okay. I was confused what you meant by loaded individually, which would indeed be an internal magazine. My bad.
Really it wasn't until the realities of WW1 set in and wartime demand for rifles encouraged streamlining production of rifles as much as possible that the magazine cutoff concept really died. Combat experience was showing that logistics were more than capable of keeping up with the fire rates afforded by magazine rifles, and meanwhile magazine cutoffs were extra parts, machining, and materials that could be easily foregone to speed up rifle production.
Thanks- yes, I meant Mannlicher. I have amended. And yes, someday someone will post a question about who was James Paris Lee, and I am sure a lot of us will eagerly post.
