But the supposed correct use of a dash—which would be an em dash not a hyphen—is like this, no space. Which drives me batty. I must prefer spaces — like this — even though it's technically against the style guides. Although it's perhaps a bit wide – which I like – but if it is felt to be too wide, en dashes as I used here would work for me. I'm fine with hyphens or dashes - like this - being used, but I think at least an en dash if not an em dash is better.
Also the EU wasn’t born out of a “let’s prevent the wars of the past and become the Federation from Star Trek but early” type of feeling that France and Germany had, it started as a coal and iron trade agreement that eventually was pushed further into cooperation thanks to the existence of an 11-time zones-big existential threat and the economic support of the US fielding the majority of the defense expenses related to prevention of that conflict (and the stabilization of international maritime trade by the sheer threat of meeting the wrong end of an USN carrier group if you try to play funny and disrupt it).
