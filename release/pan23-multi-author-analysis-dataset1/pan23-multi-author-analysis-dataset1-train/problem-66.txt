I will also have to apologize if this response breaks a rule on this server, as I am new. History, especially European history, can be incredibly dark. Learning about the injustices and trauma others have experienced, especially back to back in a lesson, can make things seem hopeless. A part of that, I argue, can be traced to "." According to the Cleveland Clinic, it is common among healthcare workers and those interacting and advocating for people on a regular basis and coming into contact with others trauma. It can lead to a whole host of problems, one of which, a sense of hopelessness, seems to fit your situation. I have heard it described, in a psychology today article by Neel Burton on Empathy, as the emotional response to trauma, where the individual feeling it takes the pain of another and tries to imagine that pain inflicted on themselves or inflicts some emotional pain on themselves.
Greetings! This is a rather heavy question that deals with a lot of the consequences of studying so much about humanity's past, and it is definitely something which can prevent some people from studying a certain event or time period in more depth. about studying history without becoming a nihilist (with contributions from several travelers, including a few flaired users) might be of some interest. I have copied my own response from there but I have also adapted parts of it to deal with how one can deal with the darker parts of history. Let's begin.
