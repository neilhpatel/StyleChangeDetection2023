Based on their failure to recind in time, YOU have 2 choices. Have the dealer provide financing under the precise terms of the sale agreement (which means that extra payment you made must also be applied to principle or refunded), or unwind the entire deal with 100% refund. If the dealer is unable to place the loan, they are obligated to carry it themselves. Skip the finance company and start talking to the dealership. Be assertive and authoritative. Remind them of the 20 day window and tell them what you expect to happen. Both TX and NV are single party consent states, therefore you should record every call (no need to advise you are recording). If they threaten you, or won't listen, advise them that you will be reaching out to the AG, State licensing board, etc. and be prepared to do battle.
Banks also don't call you and ask what you put down and what your monthly payment will be if you are already approved for a loan, That is usually determined by the bank themselves before you are approved. This whole situation is a mess.
