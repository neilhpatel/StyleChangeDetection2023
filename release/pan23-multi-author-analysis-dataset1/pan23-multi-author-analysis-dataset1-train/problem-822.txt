We'll start in the middle ages when high walls were mostly enough to keep people out. These walls are more high than thick. While it's possible to batter your way through it's often not easily nor practicably done. One of the key issues is being able to accurately hit the same point repeatedly. Deploying siege artillery powerful enough is exceedingly resource intensive. Even then storming a breach is not easily done in the face of the prepared extra defences likely added. The defenders are preparing for just such a scenario and they'll know exactly where you are going for. It's bloody and unpredictable. Especially if you plan on strategic conquest you do not want a fortified place stormed as the likelihood of damaging it is very high. It'll take most likely weeks to bombard a wall with non-gunpowder artillery, if not months.
I’m sorry to inform you but there are probably more videos making bizarre claims like that out there this particular video was a flat earth video that incorporated a lot of esoteric claims that cathedrals, mosques, palaces, and other elaborate structures built before the 19th century were built by an unified old world civilization(obv ignoring any differences in region, time and culture) and all these things were meant to channel some aetherial energy that we’ve long since forgot existed. The star shaped forts were just built to store this energy. (I’m not a flat earth btw lol) apparently the Arc de Triomphe is a magnet?
