The first real scare for the monarchy in relation to gun ownership was two high profile assassination of Protestant political figures by firearm during the reign of Elizabeth I. In a space of 13 years, the Regent of Scotland and the Prince of Orange were both assassinated by lone gun-men using a rifle and pistol respectively. Elizabeth I, as a major Protestant monarch, was wary of assassination by another Catholic gun-man so instituted the first ban of fire-arms (only near Royal palaces) and further laws in the 17th century focused on disarming Catholics while protecting gun ownership for Protestants.
I would like to push back on this point just slightly. The Nazi party strictly regulated firearms ownership among certain groups, like Jews of course, whereas Nazi party members and "loyal" Germans could own them. A major piece of firearms legislation that led to strict gun control among non-Germanic people was a gun registry. In occupied countries guns were taken, but in the homeland they were gradually handed out more and more as the war deteriorated.
