- "Not more than forty-five (45) days after the termination of occupancy, a landlord shall mail to a tenant an itemized list of damages claimed for which the security deposit may be used under section 13 of this chapter".
- "Failure by a landlord to provide notice of damages under section 14 of this chapter constitutes agreement by the landlord that no damages are due, and the landlord must remit to the tenant immediately the full security deposit.".
If we were talking a purely physical situation (no portal), it is not the landlord's responsibility to ask for your forwarding address (it is yours to provide it) and the 45-day period doesn't start until you do. The law is clear on that front because the landlord has to "mail" the remainder and deductions to that address.
One point of clarification: The landlord has 45 days to furnish the remainder and deductions from the date you provide them a forwarding address, in writing. The clock does not start until that happens. Did you provide that information when you moved out, or did you do it later?
