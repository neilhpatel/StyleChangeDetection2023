This is obviously a tough question where the answers will differ somewhat depending on how you look at it. The sources I know are mostly sociological, ethnographic (e.g. Nazpary, and Nikolayenko) or based on economy or political science (e.g. Piketty, and Segert) so bear that in mind.
After all, not only are the Russians not the only non-Kazakh ethnic group in Kazakhstan that largely doesn't speak Kazakh (and have little appetite for learning it), far from it, but there are also urban ethnic Kazakhs who also don't speak Kazakh and often find themselves in the same predicament in terms of being shut out of some things, including most of the government jobs and positions because they require Kazakh-speaking candidates.
Ironically, recent ethnic Russians who chose to move to Russia from Kazakhstan often become targets of discrimination there on account of their country of origin, especially if they don't settle in Moscow or St Pete.
I would even go as far as to say that it's not so much about favouring ethnic Kazakhs, but Kazakh-speakers, and the linguistic issue has been the biggest stumbling block.
