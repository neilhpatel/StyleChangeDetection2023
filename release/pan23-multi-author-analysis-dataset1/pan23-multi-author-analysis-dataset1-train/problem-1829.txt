Those guys on the show willingly show up to what they believe to be an underage girl's house expecting sex or to "hang out" as they say. It does not matter that they did not touch who they believed to be an underage person, their intent makes them guilty. They show up and without ever meeting their victims, get arrested and charged with intent to harm a minor, even if nothing happened. These minors aren't even real it is a sting operation to catch predators. Even from just pulling into the driveway. It shows intent. He needs to stop and date someone his own age.
This is alarming and wildly, disgustingly inappropriate. The fact that your parents support their of legal age son dating a child still in grade school should raise many a bell at the back of their heads. In what world is it okay for an eighteen-year-old to engage with a fourteen-year-old in any way other than platonic? There is none.
Yes, technically dating is not illegal, only sexual activity is. But that includes a wide spectrum of sexual activity.
