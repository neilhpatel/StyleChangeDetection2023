>They fly closer to earth and drift with wind patterns, which are not as predictable to militaries and intelligence agencies as the fixed orbits of satellites, and they can evade radar. They can also hover over areas, while satellites are generally in constant motion. Simple cameras on balloons can produce clearer images than those on orbital satellites, and other surveillance equipment can pick up signals that do not reach the altitude of satellites.
Called it. SIGINT was the only thing I could think of that would make sense for a high altitude balloon where satellites may not work (due to many frequencies being too short range or not able to penetrate the atmosphere).
Seriously. For sigint mapping it's nice to get an unimpeded aerial view, but accurate mapping to group points if accurate and effective.
"Significant" is relative. Compared to 9/11 not many events really make the cut that year. "Remember 9/11!" speeches didn't amount to shit compared to the fact 9/11 was a actually life changing event for so many of us.
