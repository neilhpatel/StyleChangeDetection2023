The English Empire maintained slavery until 1834, which very likely would have included the American colonies (as it did Canada) given their cultivation of labor crops like tobacco and cotton. So doing nothing would have continued slavery until then, theoretically at least. Now, as we all know, America continued the practice in several states until 1865. Obviously for those enslaved in Georgia, this meant their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren would live a life in bondage which would have otherwise ended at their grandchildren (under the 1834 assumption and loosely defining generations at 30 years for a measure of time).
Thanks for the reply! Very interesting, especially your point about inheriting and condoning slavery.
Reading law is easy. We give it to you guys and gals and ask "what's that say?" Seriously though in my focus there are so many legal documents and non-binding declarations (like our DoI for instance) along with wills and charters that it can be mind numbing. Throw in a medial s and words like "followeth" and it's a serious PITA to get through some of them. Still, compared to deciphering law precedents, I'd much rather read some 1674 declaration and interpret it.
