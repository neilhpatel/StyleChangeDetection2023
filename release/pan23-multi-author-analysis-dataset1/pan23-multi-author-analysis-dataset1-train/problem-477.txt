I get what you mean, but it's not okay. I am an active weed smoker, I smoke multiple times a day [not at work though even though I'd be able to functional perfectly fine, I'd just rather not since it's a quick paced job] so my tolerance is extremely high. That being said, edibles are totally different and I have certainly eaten edibles that make it hard for me to function. My mother was given a thc capsule for back pain that was WAY too high of a dose for someone who doesnt smoke or eat thc, and she told me she woke up feeling like she couldn't breath. It metabolizes differently and lasts much longer usually, especially if it's from a shop. No, they wouldnt actually OD off of it, but it's dangerous to do and is the same as poisoning somebody without the long term damage to your body. Also, imagine they hadnt carpooled that day?
Because believe me if any parent complains that you were acting erratic and you give your story you will be fired, because you didn't immediately report it, and you were not only complacent with her actions you allowed a dangerous individual to continue endangering children.
1. Do you have any proof that they gave it to you? Witnesses, recording, or self admission around others? If you don't have proof it's your word vs their word. You could always record him or her, but check with your local laws about what is legal and what isn't.
