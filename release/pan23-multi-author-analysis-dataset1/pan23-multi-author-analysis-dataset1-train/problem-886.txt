Fair enough as a concept, but until the opportunity comes up to vote again the person who switched gets to spit in the face of the voters who chose them before they decided to about-face on their stances (or outright lied about them to get in).
There needs to be a more swift method for us voters to address this kind of behaviour other than, "oh well, they fooled us, guess we'll address it in a few years when we can vote again and in the meantime I guess they can just screw me over by going entirely against what they claimed to be and what I voted for.".
Usually voters vote for independents who switch during election season when the Politician has insane name recognition in the area or a truck load of money to outspend their competitor and the competing party.
