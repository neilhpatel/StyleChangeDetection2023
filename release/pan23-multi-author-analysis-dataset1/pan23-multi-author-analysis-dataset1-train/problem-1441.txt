The only 100% clean success has been funding Ukraine, and thats only due to the fact that opposition to that consists of near traitorous remarks. Didn’t really make it hard to look like the good guy with that.
Every single news station from mainstream, to independent, right leaning, left leaning, absolutely everyone of them has been covering the Ohio situation. Even places like RT.
Yeh its really weird though given that the og comment was me being impressed with Biden but then every one read only the “i don’t like him” and decided that means I suck apparently. This country is fucked so hard.
Remind me to check on all these accounts making snide comments about Biden visiting Ohio if they make any comments about it being too late or “just because we pressured him” when he visits Ohio after coming back from Ukraine on a visit timed right before Putin makes his state of the nation speech. I’ll be curious how many acknowledge that this trip was likely strategically planned to correspond with the date of putins announcements and how many will just find a new angle to complain if he ends up in Ohio like they wanted. If they do… probably worthwhile for people to take note if that starts happening a lot.
