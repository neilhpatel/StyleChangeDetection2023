Succession by adoption was exceedingly common, at least in the early days of the Empire. Between the reigns of Julius Caesar and Trajan (the period with which I am most familiar) only one emperor was the true born son of his predecessor (Titus taking over from Vespasian in AD79). Succession by adoption, as you put it, was not so much connected to low fertility or an absence of children, it was a way of legitmising the succession of the new Emperor. Adoption, to the Romans at least among the ruling class, was nothing like adoption today. A man would usually adopt another as his son as a way of bringing him into the family, or of signalling his desired successor. Caesar adopted Augustus (then Octavian) as his son, even tho they were actually related (Octavian was Caesar's great-nephew). Augustus himself adopted several relatives - through family or marriage - as his sons Gaius, Lucius, Postumus and then Tiberius, who eventually succeeded him. This trend continued right through the period I am discussing. The fact that adoption was so important to succession can be seen clearly through Agrippina's reputed insistence that her husband Claudius adopt her son Nero as his legal child, despite Claudius already having a natural born heir in Britannicus. This gave Nero the legitimacy he needed to be taken seriously as a ruler, and was seen as a way of signalling Claudius' intent regarding his choice of successor.
