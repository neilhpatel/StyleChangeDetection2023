According to Germany's Economic Ministry, the decision was made â€œbecause the acquisition would have endangered the public order and safety of Germany."

It's not "next gen tech". The foundry in question uses a 350nm process which was state of the art in the 90s. It's the type of tech used to produce the Nintendo 64. Which is why it is up for sale.

Yeah, it's totally weird, I agree. But neither him being a useful idiot nor him personally gaining through these deals is flattering. Both are damning in fact! It's like he got replaced in a Chinese bodysnatch operation lol.
You are oversimplifying the situation. The Chinese export market is very important for German industries - going full confrontation would do much harm to German economy, and by that, to German people.
