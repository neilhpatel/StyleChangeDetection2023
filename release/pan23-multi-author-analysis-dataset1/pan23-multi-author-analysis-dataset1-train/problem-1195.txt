"Aryeh Shechopek, a 16-year-old Canadian yeshiva student who lived in the Har Nof neighborhood in Jerusalem, was killed in the first attack.".
The group that governs the vast majority of the Palestinians and which is the internationally recognized representative of the Palestinians and which has always negotiated with Israel is the Palestinian Authority. They specifically have not praised the attack.
Absolutely wrong. There is no absolute in society like that, even a child knows that. Most are racist, though, as most of you Israel not Jews kind are full of hate.
A bit like the 2004 American presidential election when it was felt that staying the course with an unqualified leader (and particularly military leader) was a better option for Iraq and Afghanistan than a decorated war hero who was not a miserable failure (though I'm sure we now all long for the benevolent idiocy of the bush years).
Hamas can only prevent peace between Gaza and Israel. Israel and the PA could make peace any time they want. Hamas canâ€™t decide when settlements are built in the West Bank or what positions on land swaps the PA takes.
You know that Hamas didn't govern one inch of Palestinian territory or hold any power in government until 2006. The conflict long long pre-dated that. Hamas is absolutely a major contributor to the conflict but they are absolutely not the cause, they are more of a symptom of the conflict. They operate in Gaza, all the peace talks and negotiations over territory and settlements are about the West Bank, which is governed and represented by the Palestinian Authority, a separate group.
I never claimed that they do. But short of invading and conquering Gaza Israel doesn't actually have any viable options to end the conflict as it is currently.
