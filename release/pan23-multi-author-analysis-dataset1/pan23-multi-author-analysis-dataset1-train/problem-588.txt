As another poster noted, what kind of harassment is going on? As a general rule employers are allowed to “harass” employees unless the harassment is based on an employees membership in a protected class, or is done as retaliation because the employee took a legal protected action, such as filing a wage complaint. If the local police department is unwilling to intervene then it sounds like the conduct doesn’t actually rise to the level of a threat, although if both you subjectively and another party objectively would feel your physical safety was in danger due to the conduct then it might be actionable if you went above the first line duty officers at the police department. In any event, since you said this was your former workplace, it doesn’t sound like there is anything else to do at the moment other than try to schedule an intake with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, though again depending on what the harassment was, it may not be something the EEOC can act on.
Thanks for replying to my post. So after looking up the different types of harassment on the EEOC website, we have evidence to support harassment for retaliation and genetic information discrimination. The store manager would often do things like comment on our body types, call us names, she physically gripped a girls wrist until it was red and left a hand print, they (store manager, regional training manager, and shift leader) blew up our phones leaving harassing messages. Some other things include making us work in unsanitary conditions. Like the ceiling was dripping water onto our toaster and bread storage and they wanted us to sell soggy product. It also created a large standing puddle and made our feet soaked. They also fabricated the details on a disciplinary action form that happened after another employee wanted to take legal action and the one written up didn’t want to elaborate on what the employee was saying to the store manager.
