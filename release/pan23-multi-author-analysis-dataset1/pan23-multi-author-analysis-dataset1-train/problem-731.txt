That doesn't sound like a violation of the law. Employees are generally not entitled to a reason for their termination, or even an affirmative acknowledgement that they've been terminated.
What do they know that you didn't post here? This looks like a perfectly executed, perfectly legal firing in California, down to the FedEx'ing of the paycheck and payout of PTO. I'm actually impressed at how right they got it all. It's like watching an Olympic gold medalist stick a triple-lutz-axel-rose or whatever they are called.
Assuming you were employed in an at-will arrangement (no union, no employment contract), your situation sounds more like regular termination than wrongful termination, but if you feel you were fired in violation of the law, or you were a member of a union or had a binding employment contract, you should consult with an employment discrimination attorney.
Thank you for your insight. I thought what he was saying didn’t seem right as California is At Will, it’s just frustrating that they refuse to tell me why.
