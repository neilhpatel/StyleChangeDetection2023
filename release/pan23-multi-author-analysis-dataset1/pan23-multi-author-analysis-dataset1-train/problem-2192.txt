In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Thank you for this. These laws have been pushed since forever yet they try claiming "compromise" every time. The mask was pulled off decades ago so its no wonder the opposition is fierce.
Seriously. Biden spent his campaign railing against the politicization of regulatory agencies, which Trump certainly did wholesale. And Biden was right. Then having taken office January 20, 2021, Biden made it all the way to February before he instructed the Attorney General, to instruct the ATF, to perform an extensive overhaul of gun regulations, based on the President's personal preferences. Congress was never consulted in even a perfunctory way.
