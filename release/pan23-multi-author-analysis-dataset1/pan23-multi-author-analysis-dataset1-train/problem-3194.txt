No. The defendant was found guilty on federal robbery charge of controlled substance. Which is up to 20 years. If I understand correctly, the armed part of the conviction tacks on 5 more, so up to 25 years. (The murder part would have allowed up to life). The 19 year sentence is within the scope of what is allowed by law for the charge that they were convicted for.

If robbery carries a 5 to 25 years sentence, and person A was found with the stolen property in their possession gets 5 years, and person B was found with the property along with the bloody knife from a homicide that happened during the robbery and grainy video evidence of the person who did the killing being the one taking the property, where it's likely they are the one who did it, but some room for minor doubt about murder, and they get 20 years- I'm kind of OK with that concept.
Am I understanding this right? Just because you go on trial for burglary and murder, but are only found guilty of burglary, you shouldn’t have extra sentencing because you were on trial for murder too.
The whole point here is that the acquitted portions of the alleged crime shouldn’t factor into the sentence for the convicted portion of the alleged crime.
