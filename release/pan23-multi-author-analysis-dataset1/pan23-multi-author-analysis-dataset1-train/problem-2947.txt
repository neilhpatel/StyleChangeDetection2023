If russia continues the war, targets in russia will be a more common thing until they're willing to talk. If the war is continued indefinitely, unconditional surrender will be the only option, russias military power will have to be neutalized or reduced to insignificance.
I already read that “interview” with Biden back when it happened. According to Biden the only way for Russia to end the war is to pull out of Ukraine.
So the only way for Biden to want to talk to Putin is if Putin intends to end the war by pulling out of ukraine.
Another part of the interview Biden stated “There's one way for this war to end, the rational way: Putin could pull out of Ukraine, No. 1. It appears he's not going to do that. He's paying a very heavy prince for failing to do it." So he’s only willing to talk to Putin if Putin intends to leave Ukraine.
Yes, he’d want to talk if Putin wants to end the war by pulling out of Ukraine. I read the interview last Thursday when it happened. There is more to that interview. I’ll see if I can find it and I’ll edit this post.
