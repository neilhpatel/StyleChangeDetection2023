The GOP have plugged in and amped up hatred and crazy so much that conservatives that have a good head on their shoulders don’t know which way is up anymore. I am on a business trip and I brought up the HBO show last of us to the guy I was traveling with, and he told me he is huge fan of the game and loved what they are doing on the show. Then he just volunteered that he hated that they always had to shove the gay stuff down our throats. This dude is a huge fan of the game right? It’s big part of the game and not just for the characters he was referring to. Why would the show bother him? I think Christian religions are desperate to stop what must be a mass exodus. I think this doubling down harder than ever on gay issues is to ensure who they already have and future converts will be more indoctrinated with fear and hatred than ever before because if they don’t they lose it all. That core group that is too scared to question needs to be much bigger. They need teachers that are so pious they would turn in their students for their future sins. They need normal dudes on business trips to hate something that had nothing but love in the telling of it. They need fascism to keep what power they have left. They have no other ideas but hate. And all it is is theater for these assholes.
Exactly. My sister was outed in high school, and when my religious parents found out they beat her until she bled and then dragged her by her hair into the car and drove off with her. When my parents returned home they told me my sister ran away. I was only 8 years old.
