This is possible, but it seems like DeSantis is ambitious, and there are signs that he could actually win the primary if he runs (he's rising in the polls over time and appears to be seen by large portions of the R base as the future of the party); I'm sure he sees this himself and might want to take his chances. Also, for both parties, the person who's the front-runner years before the election usually isn't the nominee. DeSantis would be a fool not to take his chances; he'd probably have a better shot at winning in '24 than Trump would (since he doesn't have an age problem, hasn't already lost to Biden, has R donors itching to support him, and doesn't have a mountain of legal issues).
This guyâ€¦this GUY?! He is so far up trumps ass he can tell you which burger joint he ate at last when he needed it.
