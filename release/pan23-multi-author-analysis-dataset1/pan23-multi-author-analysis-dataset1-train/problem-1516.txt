If they hadn't had to fight the Western Front could the Germans have fought the Russians to a stalemate? Could this have led the Russians to accept terms which saw them take territories in Eastern Europe while leaving Germany to keep the West? Maybe. Could the losses by Russia have become so overwhelming that the Soviet leadership was deposed and terms sought by a new government? Maybe. Could the Western Allies have sought to depose Hitler but establish a friendly German government backed by the UK and US as a counterweight to Soviet Russia? Maybe.
I've seen people focusing on the East Front frequently citing not Kursk or Stalingrad but the much earlier battle of _Moscow_ (i.e., December 1941-January 1942) and the developments surrounding it as the most significant turning point. After all, Soviet leadership appeared confident enough that their emergency mobilization would be enough to halt the advance of the exhausted German batallions, with Stalin notably being confident enough of the outcome to remain in the capital himself even while evacuating other staff. What's your view on that?
I’ve heard that the Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 – 2 February 1943) was seen as the moment when it became clear that Germany might not win the war, and the Battle of Leningrad (8 September 1941 – 27 January 1944) victory marked the moment when it was clear that Germany would not win the war. Is that what Overy is alluding to with his ‘early 1942’ framing?
