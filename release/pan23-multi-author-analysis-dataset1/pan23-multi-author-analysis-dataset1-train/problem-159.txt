In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. At 61 years old, this has been drilled into me over and over. The weird thing is sometimes you don't realize you have a belief until it's outdated.
Exactly. World War 3 is being fought right now. It’s not a war between nations with bombs, planes, and tanks. It’s largely an ideological war between liberal democracy and far right autocracy. It’s being fought- with the exception of Ukraine- on the internet, on the streets, and through relatively small acts of violence. We’re all in the middle of a worldwide game of chess where the pieces are being slowly and chaotically moved around the board. Elon buying Twitter is a piece moved for the right, Lola winning his election in Brazil a move for the left, Ukraine holding Russia back, the attempted kidnapping of Michigan’s governor, revolution in Iran, January 6th, protests against China’s Covid policy, the club Q shooting in Colorado. Each of these events and many others, while individually still having drastic ramifications, together tell a larger story about the situation humanity is in right now: an ideological and systematic tipping point.
