The supernatural was terrifying because most of the entities were capricious and they all were powerful and potentially dangerous. There were precautions to take - and only a fool would not take them. Even a skeptic. No reason to tempt fate. Rather like knocking on wood or a child avoiding stepping on a crack. One may not believe, but, hey, don't push your luck.
Adelantados were therefore placed under extreme pressure to maintain the resources required for a successful entrada, establish a permanent base of operations, find something that made the new colony immediately economically viable to recoup their losses and continue to hold crown support (hence the preoccupation with precious metals), and convince the crown the local population posed no threat to their endeavors. Lobbying between adelantados and the crown often took years. For example, Juan de OÃ±ate originally submitted a license to conquer New Mexico in 1595, petitioned repeatedly to lobby for contractual fulfillment when the license was revoked in 1597, and then engaged in a prolonged legal battle from 1606-1624 for use of excessive force during the entrada.
