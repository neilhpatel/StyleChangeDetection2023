As a former practicing criminal defense attorney, this is the most underrated advice in this thread. You would be surprised how often I had to protect my clients from themselves by telling them to take stupid pictures/videos off of social media. Even if there isn't "the" pictures/video of him committing the crime, there could be other corroborating evidence in his posts, such as pictures wearing the same clothes as in the security footage or incriminating status updates from the timeframe (posting something like: "Karma's a bitch".
Well, sure. And if there were no video and a keyed car, there would be circumstantial evidence this guy did it based on his past conduct and the threats. But he'd never be convicted on that evidence. My point being that it often does matter whether you only have circumstantial evidence vs. direct evidence.
Your video evidence is NOT circumstantial evidence (which is evidence in which you infer a fact from the circumstances). All you'd need is a witness saying what he was wearing that day and the video would be pretty conclusive. The cops don't care because this is a really minor crime, but you should think about a civil restraining order, which has a lower burden of proof.
