My wife is a historian whose PhD is in folklore and material culture. I call it the history of the mundane. Things like what color were rooms painted in the 1920s. Or when did people start buying clothes off the rack rather than making them or going to a tailor. Good stuff.
so the best part is that I'm 90% sure that this was a joke question, but you totally could There are varying prices for donkeys, going as high as Pliny's claim that one crazy (probably drunk) noble paid 400,000 sesterces (100,000 denarii/pieces of silver) for one particularly fine donkey, but they were reasonably expensive creatures - think what you'd pay for a workhorse of a car or truck. Not necessarily gonna break your bank, but not generally an off-the-cuff purchase. We've got a general range of prices between 11 and 50 denarii for a donkey though - so, depending on how much you've stuffed yourself, you could probably afford - or haggle for - a midrange donkey Nothing incredible, but certainly an animal that'll take you from point A to point B .
