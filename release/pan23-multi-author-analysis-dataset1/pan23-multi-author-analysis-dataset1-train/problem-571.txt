Lumber prices are sky high right now, that could be in your favour, as the thing allegedly stole is in high demand and relatively expensive, also some trees may have been endangered, get an arborist or naturalist to check stuff out. As an example, paper birch poaching is a big problem in some areas and has extra charges.
When it comes to costs incurred, include the cost of replanting trees that are of the same size that he took. This is definitely not ok and you need to talk to an attorney who specializes in this area, and an arborist and naturalist to assess the damage (monetary and otherwise for the environment as to what you can do to restore it).
My favorite color! LOL. I PLAN on marking the trees that are left with a number. I will also mark and number as many stumps I can find. Some are 16‚Äù + wide. He covers them. I also saw a tree with a large wedge cut out of the trunk. I showed his wife. He once said I cut up fallen trees and diseased trees. No evidence of any tree ‚Äúdisease‚Äù. Of course cutting wedges out of the trunk can cause a tree to die. ‚òπÔ∏è üå≥.
No one removes fallen or diseased tress on other people's property without consulting them The not known neighbors would be a walk around together and hiring professionals. The friendly neighbors would be a phone call You just don't cut on someone else's land.
