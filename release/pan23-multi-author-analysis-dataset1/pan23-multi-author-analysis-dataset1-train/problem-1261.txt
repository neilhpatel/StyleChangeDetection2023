Also I don't give a fuck. For one it is ridiculous to look back hundreds or a thousand+ years to try and determine who has rights to a region due to DNA, and for two the same religious bullshit that gives Jewish people ownership over Israel tells the story of them taking it through violence. So if we disregard stupid religious bullshit they have to give it away to the people that THEY stole it from. Right?

Gross. Biden's such a disappointment. I'm going to choke on my own bile if I have to vote for him again, but I will over any Republican. The only good thing you can say about Bibi is that he's not as much of an insane Zionist monster as some of the rest of Israel, but he's still an insane Zionist monster.

Israel is primarily atheist. Zionism is just a bullshit excuse that white Europeans use for taking land from the actual inhabitants. None of the founders of Israel looked like their families came from the Middle East.
