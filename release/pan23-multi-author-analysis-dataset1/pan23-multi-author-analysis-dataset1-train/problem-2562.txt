So I first have to say that I have absolutely no problem with drag shows or gay Beauty pageants. Haven't been to too many of them just because they're not my scene but I'm sure there are a lot of Republicans who are going to be completely up in arms about this teenager performing in what they see as grossly sexual acts.
I know nothing. This is pure speculation but Iâ€™m wondering why no reporters have investigated this. (Or if investigated, why not actually publish.).
Heck, the qanon called is probably already coming up with conspiracy theories explaining how the misspellings are actually a sign that he was secretly fighting against an international cabal of Pizza eating pedophiles like they did every time the former guy made a typo or boom boom in his pants.
It's ok, buddy. This will make you less unpopular with the libs. Don't worry about all that anti-woke fearmongering about drag shows by conservatives. They are total fucking hypocrites and won't actually care.
