Second is the landlord possibly selling the home. Can you explain how it was left on their property for months without payment? It’s possible that it was considered abandoned and the landlord could do with it as he pleased. But specifics matter.
While not argument-proof, I would think that specifying there was a verbal agreement to store the property for 4 months and a demonstrable lack of any attempt by the land owner to get them to remove the property prior to the sale or even notify them of intent to dispose would be enough to support the claim that the agreement exists.
You have two separate issues. One is the loan which you’re responsible for regardless. Having it stolen doesn’t mean you don’t owe it anymore.
Not necessarily. NAL but in my experience most states have a requirement of good faith contact regarding abandoned property. You can't just ignore it for a while then claim it's yours, you have to make a good faith effort to return the property to its rightful owners i.e. letters, timelines, etc.
