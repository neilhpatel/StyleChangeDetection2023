Other possessions that you are allowed to use (or exclusively use) but were not explicitly gifts (furniture, etc) will typically belong to your parent.
Make a plan today. Start discreetly looking for a placed to live the day you turn 18, be it with a friend, alternate family, or your dad. If you have access to your birth certificate, social security card, ID, or anything else important be ready to take those with you. Definitely get a new bank account at a DIFFERENT bank on your 18th birthday, or as soon as safely possible. Check your credit too. Credit karma is free. You need to know if anything was opened in your name so that way you can try and fix any damage done before it's too late. Be prepared to freeze you credit if you need to as well.
I've seen a good amount of people say that I'm old enough for my opinion to count, but would it be possible for her to make any arguments saying I'm not mature enough to have a say based on things like me not having a learner's permit or things like diagnosed executive dysfunction?
Anything you bought or were given as gifts. The problem a lot of young people have when they turn 18, if their parent doesn't give them the things back, is all they can do is to sue. And that's a huge hassle, probably not worth it, and they risk getting kicked out. Once you turn 18 if you still live at home, your parents can still control quite a bit, just not as much. I've been there. Their recourse at that point is to kick you out (with proper legal notice of course, 15 days in your state).
