Could you speak to volume of AAA fire in defended locations, in comparison to say to other heavily defended areas like Baghdad during the first gulf war or Antwerp in ww2.
So, where do we start? Ah, yes, bullets. If you have an AK rifle and happen to be close to a hovering helicopter, sure, you can spray your 30 bullets in the hope of damaging the engine or killing the pilots. But in terms of bullets that’s not where the true danger to aircraft lies. Against aircraft, one would use dedicated anti-aircraft weapons ranging from heavy machine guns to heavy 100 mm anti-aircraft artillery (AAA for short).
Your assumption that bullets are faster than airplanes is correct (for the most part), but if you want to shoot down a plane with a machine gun, you won’t fire so that your bullets chase after the target closing up on its tail. The fundamental principle of anti-aircraft gunnery is called deflection. This means that you calculate or assess where the target will be after a specific time and shoot at that place, not at where the target is now. It’s easier to show than to describe, so . As you see, if it takes 4 seconds for the bullets to cover the distance to the target’s current location, the target will have moved away by a distance of 700–800 meters while moving at a speed of 700 kph (the numbers are just an example and don’t represent any specific situation). Thus, you need to predict where the target will be, and aim there, even if the distance that the bullets need to cover is longer.
