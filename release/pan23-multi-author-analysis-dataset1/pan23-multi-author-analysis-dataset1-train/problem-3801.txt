I will be honest with you. Bolsonaro is responsible for what happened in Brazil, but he will probably not be criminally charged for it. He instigated the fascist, but I don't know if they will be able to charge him with crimes against democracy. BUT... well, Bolsonaro is in heated waters with the law for other reasons, but was protected by his presidential status, reason why he was so desperate to win, and looked so defited when he lost.
And no, Bolsonaro did not concede, him hided himself away after saying the elections were rigged and than run to US at the last day of his presidency to avoid passing the presidencial sash to Lula in a cerimony that takes place since the end of brazilian dictatorship. What, ironically, ended up giving Lula the oportunnity to spite on his face, just like the attempted coup.

Congress gave a standing ovation to the equivalent legislative representative from another country, who acted to exert legislative authority against an executive branch who was believed to be fraudulently claiming election victory. It's not really surprising they would clap for that.
