I say this as someone who has tried being both vegan and vegetarian. I like meat. Meat is delicious. As is cheese. I'm sorry. I'm weak, and I'm sorry for that. I wish I weren't, but I'm not there yet.
I don’t particularly care about factory farm conditions as long as they make some effort to prevent contamination or similar health risks, but I didn’t know they made it illegal to film in their slaughterhouses- it should be legal to see the abuse conditions within their farms, it’s strictly upside for consumers to know what they’re actually getting.
I guess? Except that the majority of biomass is plants, so it doesn’t seem so odd to separate out some things just to get a sense of scale. I mean, all statistics are really useless unless you’re trying to make some point about something. If you don’t care how much of x and y there is, a statistic is pointless. It’s really just sort of an eye opener - 96% of all mammalian “things” (by weight) on our planet are people and our food. It’s like saying 25% of all animal species on earth are types of beetles. Kind of cool but if you don’t care, then it’s a useless stat. I personally think it’s kinda crazy how successful beetles are but you might not.
