This is such an excellent answer, thank you so much for taking the time to write this out! I learned a lot, and I’m very interested in reading more about this in the sources you listed.
An interesting point highlighted by Carolyn Williams in Gilbert and Sullivan: Gender, Genre, Parody is that the Boatswain's suggestion that nationhood would be based on self-identification, that Ralph chooses to declare himself an Englishman and not a different nationality, would be considered pretty ridiculous to a Victorian British audience that would have seen national identities as decided by one's birth. The Boatswain's song thus becomes even more pointless by making a – to the Victorians – nonsensical argument to affirm Ralph's Englishness even more than it can actually be demonstrated.
Ralph bringing up his Englishness is thus fundamentally irrelevant to the matter at hand. Nobody doubts he is English, and whether he is English or not has no bearing on the matter of his status in society relative to Josephine, which is the core source of conflict. The Boatswain suddenly stepping in to lead the ship's crew in a rousing affirmation of Ralph's Englishness does nothing to actually resolve the issue. Indeed, it is immediately followed by the Captain returning to the plot-relevant matter, with the subtle and perhaps intentional detail that he refers to Ralph as a British tar and not an English one. In other words, the entire song is a that will have no bearing on the plot going forward.
