What's more odd is calling it a joint development when it's just adapting old tech into a new system. Israel is weird like that though always wanting to say they developed something when they're clearly just buying the tech and the contractors(this time from lockheed and raytheon) to shove it into their systems and show them how to adapt the tooling for local machines.
Yep. The US Navy has several test laser systems deployed on some of its ships with 300kW versions in production. The US army is deploying 50kW lasers on Stryker vehicles. This is all decades old stuff, yet "Lockheed and Israel to develop laser weapons!".
You could buy a bunch of cheap model planes, some minor software and programming to turn it into a basic missile, arm them with basic explosives, and now you have a missile swarm that can target the capital or a nuclear power plant. All of which can be legally bought in the US for a few thousand dollars. I'm amazed no one has done this yet with all of the crazy going on right now.
It's basically already fully developed. They made sure to show it off to Biden when he visited. They want the Americans to be involved inorder to get business from them, and better their chances of selling it to European country's. It also means that American dollars goes to further r@d for the tech wich Israel is involved in. It's kind of like almost all American fighter jet pilot helmets are made by an Israeli company.
