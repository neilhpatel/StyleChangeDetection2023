Pulling this number from probably 20 years ago, but I had a teacher tell us that if an average person did not die from disease or age, then the average age would go up to 500 based on current chance of dying in an accident.
I kind of like my job. And the parts I don't like, I feel are largely a result of putting extra pressure on myself to succeed fast because time is so limited.
It's not hypothetical immortality, it's factual cellular replication. Your previous comment makes no sense.
It is no different than the boat scene in the dark knight, except that for every 20 years or so that you exist after your 20s or 30s, you are robbing of the possibility of life of 1 or more people who would have been born, and even if you are one of those "I don't wanna have children" type people, your existence alone consumes resources that won't be available for other peoples descendants, it's fine if your life is normal, but that quickly starts to stack up if suddenly everyone is like that.
I want a kid, in theory. And I'm getting to the age now where it's probably now or never in the next 5 years....
