I actually have quite a great deal of respect for him as a person, because he worked himself up in those surroundings and still managed to represent this kind of compassion and understanding. It's debatable if the church is a good or a bad thing in the grand scheme of things, but no matter how I view the church, I do see him as a positive influence on the church and its followers.
exactly. Just because he hides pedophiles and runs a criminal, immoral enterprise doesn't mean he's not a caring. compassionate and loving soul. people these days.
He runs the worlds largest officially homophobic, transphobic, sexist organization. He’s just another piece of shit.
Of course what christians do is going to be a mixed bag for secularists or those of differing religion, but why speculate on alternate histories when we have a history that has shown that care for the sick for the explicitly christian belief that Jesus is God and Jesus healed people and commanded his followers to do the same for the reason that people are made in God’s image and have inherent dignity has lead to care of millions of people and over a quarter of health facilities worldwide when we count the catholic church alone, not including orthdox or protestant institutions.
That's the way I see it, too. He can't just say things like: we represent this thing now and we gonna do things that way. I mean he physically can, but he will no longer be pope then and won't be able to influence the church as a whole. He has to navigate his words and actions very carefully to even stay in this position where he has a tiny bit of influence to the people that ultimately decide the future of the church. I do think he's a better person then non catholics give him credit for, it just doesn't change the fact that he's a fallible human being that's getting used by other people.
