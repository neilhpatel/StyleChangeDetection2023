With your father having passed on the 3rd is going to be extremely difficult to prove or disprove. And the first one seems like it should be a no-brainer. It appears the second prong is to be the most crucial to you. If you were common law married as a direct descendant of the gentleman without a will you are entitled to inherit a portions of the estate. If there was no common law marriage you and your siblings should inherit everything . You need to speak to a probate attorney and or a family attorney right away. This is not a fine wine and it will not get better with age.
I believe they were together 2-3 years, my Dad didn’t like talking about his relationships much so I’ve never even heard him refer to her as anything other than his friend and from what I’ve heard from his coworkers and his friends they either didn’t even know he had a girlfriend or they hadn’t heard him ever refer to her as his wife. The problem is that she has a lot of friends who she’s been talking statements from and I’m sure that they’re lying for her and since my Dad rarely talked about his girlfriend at all, it’s hard to prove that he didn’t call her his wife because he never really called her anything other than her name.
