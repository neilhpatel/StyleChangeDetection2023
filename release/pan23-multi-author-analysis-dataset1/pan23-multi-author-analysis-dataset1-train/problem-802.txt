In the very last election, Rosie Barton gave soft underhand questions to both OToole and Trudeau but opened on Singh in the debates with: your affordable housing policies threaten the retirement plan of millions of Canadians. She pitted the youth against boomers and won. I will never forget that.

I am in 100% the same situation. Visited 8 places today in Toronto. I make 100k. All places but 2 were shithole cess pits in basements for 1700 a month. Even landlords are admitting it isnt sustainable. U know times are fucked when....
