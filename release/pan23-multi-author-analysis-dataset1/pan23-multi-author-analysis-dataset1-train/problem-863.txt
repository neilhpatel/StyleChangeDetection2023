Thing is that they’re not restricting their capital. They have a larger middle class than the US and have pulled more of their citizens (both gross and percentage) out of poverty than the US too. Of course there’s the whole Taiwan argument and the freedom of speech argument. But that’s kinda them playing the long game just how you said. Because, yeah you’re right, USSR fucked up hard. The two pieces of legislation that killed the USSR was parastroika and glasnost (sorry if I spelled those wrong I’m on mobile). China basically has taken a lesson from USSRs failing and says “oh. So the free market thing worked for them but as soon as they got liberal with their freedom of speech the whole thing crumbled” and now it’s the law that you’re not allowed to neither endorse nor criticize the government there.
Why? Because it makes them a shittonne of money. They also get to send their workers around the world (To assist, they don't do all the work themselves), creating themselves jobs. They want to keep making money and creating jobs.
A lot of the prevalent attitudes in sub-saharan Africa are more anti-west (because colonialism) and China does have significant clout (because they are a huge purchaser of African resources) but the overwhelming majority arent Chinese puppets.
Nope. Colonialism ended 60 years ago and growth has been pretty much stagnant since then. Which countries are doing "very well"...? Botswana, maybe Equatorial Guinea, we're talking about a few small nations with resources that still have the majority of the populace living in severe poverty.
