Which sounds fascinating! Who were their converts, and what about Judaism appealed to them? How were converts received by the Jewish community writ large.
That's an interesting question about incorporating Native American elements. I'll say that I didn't come across much of that, and I certainly wouldn't say it was common. To the extent that that happened, I'd think that it was more of a second half of the twentieth-century phenomenon, as the (white) cultural understanding of Native Americans shifts quite a bit. But I'm not sure.
Have you seen newer examples of US government actively threatening religious institutions for preaching transcendence without pledging devotion to government?
1. I don't mean that there were explicit efforts on the part of American Jews to proselytize Christians analogous to the efforts by Christians to proselytize Jews. The asymmetry there is important. But one of the entertaining part of the research was reading Isaac Mayer Wise, who liked publicizing the conversions of Christians to Judaism in the Occident. Wise sticking it to the missionaries was an example of the freedom that American Jews felt to make converts that European Jews, especially before emancipation, did not.
