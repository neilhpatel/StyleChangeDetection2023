So at what point did the gender and title of this piece change to the queen? H. J. R. Murray's massive 900+ page tome, _A History of Chess_, which is still considered the seminal survey of chess history, discusses this (pp. 423-4):
As you have mentioned, Chess grew out of the Indian board game Chaturanga; the gameplay of Chaturanga changed quite a bit as it travelled across the Silk Road, the modern European form of Chess (which is from roughly the 1500s) grew out of the Persian game Shatranj (which itself grew from Chaturanga).
That last bit is incorrect. Russian ferz' is a masculine noun, so the book has that one wrong. I'm not sure what the implications are here though.
Other variations of Chaturanga which predate modern Chess are still being played today, perhaps the most notable is Xiangqi, which is very popular in China (some speculate Xiangqi is even more played than Chess), its origins are rather ambiguous, with a minority of historians speculating Xiangqi is older than Chaturanga (though this is not commonly accepted). The rules of Xiangqi have remained relatively the same since its conception, it does not have a queen piece, rather, it has two advisers for the king (or a general/governor in Xiangqi), the advisers are weaker than the ferz in Shatranj, as not only can they only move one square diagonally, but they are confined to a 3x3 square palace along with the general (Xiangqi also has pieces and terrain not present in Chess, cannons are one of the pieces controlled, and a river in the centre of the board changes how some of the pieces move). The Thai version of Chess (Makruk) is also relatively similar to Shatranj, with the ferz moving the exact same way as the one in Shatranj.
