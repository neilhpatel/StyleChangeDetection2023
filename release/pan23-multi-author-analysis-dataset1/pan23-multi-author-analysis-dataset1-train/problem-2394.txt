I agree 100%. The term moderate Republican is an oximoron. Moderate or liberal Republican is a mythical creature just like a “good” Nazi was after WW2. There is no such thing and Ds would be wise to recognize that. Make no mistake, any reaching over the aisle by Democrats will be seen as a weakness, used and abused by the MAGA crazies to the fullest. Let the Rs burn themselves down. Only then, maybe, there will be some self reflection although I would not hold my breath for it.
Republicans had metal detectors removed. Several of them are probably carrying guns. If a fist fight broke out there's a good chance someone would get shot.
