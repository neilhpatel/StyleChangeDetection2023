They were right. These collapsible boats were pulled from Navy troopships, and while White Star line had them certified by the Board of Trade, some of them were so old and unused they were collapsing and unable to be unopened. The striking firemen refused to board Olympic unless she was refitted with wooden lifeboats. In response, White Star fired the union men, and hired non union firemen for the NY sailing.
That's really interesting, thanks! I had known about them screwing over the musician's families, but not about the union/lifeboat fight and their efforts to dodge legal responsibility. It would be interesting to see how such efforts would fair in modern times, given the power of social media and the rest. Hopefully we never find out...
Immediately after Titanic, the navy began patrolling the upper east coast of North America for icebergs, which eventually lead to the International Ice Patrol. Unfortunately, neither the Navy for the Coast Guard were able to spare the resources for constant North Atlantic surveillance, so along with the above safety standards, SOLAS created the Ice Patrol with a fleet dedicated solely to iceberg tracking and the protection of passenger ships.
Great answer. I have a follow up question in reference to the part of your answer quoted above. Did WSL actually sue surviving crew members, or did they just refuse to pay out compensation? Or is it related to the conflict with the Fireman's union over the collapsible life boats on Olympic?
