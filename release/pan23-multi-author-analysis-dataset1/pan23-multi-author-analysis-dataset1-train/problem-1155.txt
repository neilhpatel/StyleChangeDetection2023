Yep. Had a gun runner case a while back. He was getting stolen pistols in my area and selling them at insane prices in Canada. Like $3000+ for a newer Glock.
Beyond these senseless attacks on millions of the most thoroughly vetted, heavily regulated and law abiding Canadians while ignoring the true causes of gun violence, all of this government's gun control announcements seem to be suspiciously timed to distract from whatever negative press they're receiving at that given moment. Many of theses laws bypass the legal, democratic processes that are the foundation of our country's system of government. Additionally, this government has thus far been unwilling to provide evidence that any of these measures will do what they say they will, despite this evidence being requested by media outlets and witnesses in the ongoing hearings.
Yup. Guns run deep in my family. It's taught from dad to his kids and passed down over and over. It is a way of life. It let's us connect and remember our connection to wild. To the hunt, as our ancestors did. We will not give it up. It's like asking a Muslim to skip Ramadon.
Exactly. Fuck that nonsense. You can easily have family bonding moments in countless other ways, but the families that lose loved ones to gun violence can never have them back. Is a little bit of recreation really worth kindergarten classes being slaughtered?
