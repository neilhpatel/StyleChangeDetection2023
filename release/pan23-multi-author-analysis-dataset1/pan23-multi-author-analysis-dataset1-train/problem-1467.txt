You should be well in the clear. A lot of unsavory tenants have been throwing around the moratorium when it didn't apply to see if they could intimidate their landlord into non-action. I'd let your tenant know that you've spoken to an attorney who advised you to move forward with the eviction on June 1st, and that the CDC Moratorium only covered evictions for non-payment of rent and would not cover her case as a holdover tenant.
Due to the novel nature of things right now, it's not a terrible idea to book 30 mins to an hour of a local landlord attorney's time just to have them look everything over, but I don't see any reason why you would be prevented from moving forward with eviction on June 1st.
Thanks. I spoke to a lawyer and he said we should be good to move forward with the eviction but the tenant threw the cdc moratorium at me as a defense. Her and her husband separated and he moved out. Since we were month to month and they were always late with rent (even before covid) I wanted to try and sell the house. I told her I would give her 2 months rent free so she could put a deposit on a new place, she agreed and we set the end date for May 31st. The eviction would be due to lease termination not non payment.
