The presence of lead throws this right out the window. Numerous studies link elevated bone or blood lead levels with aggression, destructive and delinquent behavior, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and criminal behavior [Wright et al. 2008; Braun et al. 2006; Needleman et al. 2004; Needleman et al. 2002; Nevin 2000; Bellinger et al. 1994].
Plastic bottles are incredible pollutants, and would be prohibitively expensive if their environmental costs were not externalized.
Sure it is. It’s not the tobacco companies being assholes and littering. Smokers could just as easily strip the burning bits from the butts, and throw them away in a trash can instead of flinging them off into the wild blue yonder. But they don’t, and passing on the cost right back to the source of the problem is a great way to make those responsible be the ones affected by their actions.
In reality? The recycling company. There's tons of "recycling" that the companies collect and decide that it isn't economically viable to process so they ship it all right to the landfill anyway.
