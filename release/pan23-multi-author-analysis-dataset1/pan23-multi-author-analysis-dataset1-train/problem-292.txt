Cast iron still is used to make cookware, of course. As it can crack rather easily, cast iron pots and pans need to be somewhat heavy to be durable, which makes them better able to distribute heat evenly for cooking. Cast iron's coarse structure and oxidized surface also helps it hold and absorb polymerized oils , which keeps those pancakes from sticking.
Steel could be made thinner and so made lighter, but a heavy cast iron pan distributed the heat better, and food stuck to it less. Cast iron also corroded more slowly- and did it evenly. So, other than weight, there was no great reason for stamped steel cookware to actually displace cast iron. In the there were nine kinds of cast iron cookware offered ( in different sizes) but only three kinds of steel cookware ( roasting pans, skillets). Only kettles/ tea kettles were still available. But there was already a whole page of aluminum cookware of different kinds...and that page was the first page in the cookware section- clearly, aluminum was the New Thing.
Interesting. So why didn't it catch on so much in America/UK? Differences in cusine or cooking techniques? Culture? Or just how sometimes things don't catch on for random reasons?
