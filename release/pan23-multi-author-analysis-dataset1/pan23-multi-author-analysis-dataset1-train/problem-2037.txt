But at that point we're hitting the problem that for Israel, it's best if the West Bank is neither Israel nor anything else. It is de facto uncontested under their control, offering them all privileges related to the land, but it is not Israel, meaning they acknowledge no obligation towards it and its people. So the West Bank can't have a government, and so there's no credible institution that could be paid, because the PNA cannot in practice fulfill the obligations of a government.
Hah! Are you actually arguing that they don't want to cleanse the land of Jews and they wouldn't do it if given the opportunity? They have been telegraphing their intent for over a century now.
Incorrect. The reason the mission was carried out in the first place is because the subset of Judaism practiced by the Ethiopian Jewish community was determined to indeed be Judaism. The current Aliyah minister in Israel (responsible for encouraging Jews to immigrate to Israel) is literally an Ethiopian Jew. Hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of Ethiopian Jews make Aliyah each year.
