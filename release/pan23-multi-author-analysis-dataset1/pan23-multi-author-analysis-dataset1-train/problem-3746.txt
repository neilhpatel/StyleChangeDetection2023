But again none of this should have anything to do with him being able to turn the heat down. So I mean. I’d let him know that the opening of the windows is a bad idea unless you’re sleeping and crack it. Otherwise the heat will keep running, and if it’s electric or oil that can significantly raise the bill, like very significantly. So most landlords would be pissed. She may have locked in a flat rate with a heating oil Company, but open windows will burn through it quicker and she’ll have to refill it sooner, which means it’s not really such a flat rate. Perhaps you’re in a city with steam heat. Idk if anywhere here has that. Maybe Hoboken or somewhere up there. But the whole heating thing makes very little sense to me.
Unfortunately, I only know enough to know what I don't know here - the particular pieces that I'm seeing are wrong the top voted comment (what the clause around termination means is actually related to just cause termination and is NOT a reason to break a lease mid-lease) and the people who are saying "if it's in his lease she can do whatever she wants" (it appears to be superseded by NJ case law).
Yes thank you. This needs to be a sticky on every NJ landlord/tenant post. Generic advice for the US simple does not apply to NJ in a majority of cases.
