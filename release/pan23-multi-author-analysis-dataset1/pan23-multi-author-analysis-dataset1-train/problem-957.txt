I would say Biden did an unexpectedly good job. You'll probably latch onto one specific thing he messed up on (rail strike, messy pullout in Afghanistan) while also intentionally ignoring the things he did accomplish (hundreds of billions to fight climate change, trillions for infrastructure, COVID relief, doing exceptionally good backing up Ukraine against Russia, bill to begin funding mass production of massive factories from Intel/TSMC to make CPUs and silicon for consumer electronics, etc).
I don't know that I would go so far as to call Biden a loser, but Trump was the clear winner. He continues to avoid any legal consequences, the House flipping to the GOP means an avenue of investigation is closed off, and he proved he still has it by grifting over $4M from his fans for a bunch of magic beans in less than a day.
Neither. Both of them are disappointing and deeply flawed candidates that are far too old for the job. We keep saying we want younger, fresher faces but end up electing the oldest person to ever in the White House.
