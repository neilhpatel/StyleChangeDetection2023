I'd also research legal aid surrounding predatory loans in Mississippi. On top of that, involving/contacting the State Attorney General's Office, can potentially resolve things. I wish you the best of luck!
It looks like Speedy Cash has been sued many many times in different states for violating lending laws by charging higher interest rates than legally allowed and/or not properly disclosing loan terms and misleading customers. Earlier this year they had to forgive 5% of their loans after losing a class action lawsuit. It looks like your interest rate is higher than Mississippi allows, but it's possible they have carefully crafted their product to fit in some loophole in the law in Mississippi. Don't take legal advice from your adversary, of course "Mike" at Speedy Cash will tell you that they are only doing legal things. I would see if you can get a free consultation with a local lawyer.
Get a free consultation. They will tell you if you have a case or not. Then you can decide if you want to pay them to proceed or not. but don't pay for the initial consultation.
