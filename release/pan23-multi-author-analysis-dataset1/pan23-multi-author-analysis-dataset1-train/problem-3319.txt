In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. My favorite biblical passage to bring up whenever someone wants to ban "sexually explicit" books is the story of Lot's daughters. They were hiding in a cave with their father after Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. Except, they thought the whole world was destroyed.

Absolutely. The fact that mammary glands are intrinsic to female mammals and become active before/after child birth - which we all know is caused by sexual intercourse - means milking a cow is encouraging sexual thoughts.
It's simple. They ban laymen from reading the bible. It'll be back to medieval times with priests telling you what Christianity is supposed to be.
