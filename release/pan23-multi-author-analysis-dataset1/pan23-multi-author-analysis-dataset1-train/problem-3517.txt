Until the 1904 Corporation of Bristol Act, Barton Hill was part of Barton Regis, which is the name of both the settlement and the Anglo-Saxon Hundred it sat in. At this point, Barton Regis was largely based on what is now Eastville, but also extended to cover much of what is now Barton Hill, St George and Speedwell, so while Barton Hill is kind of named after the Domesday settlement, it is likely due to being the hill adjacent to the Bertune.
This reminds me of a point I wanted to make. I am vaguely aware that in the US you have this concept of towns and cities becoming "incorporated" at a certain point in time which suggests (and I'm guessing now) some kind of formal process and in some cases this might mean a decision on the name has to be made and agreed by certain people in order to file the incorporation.
Nice, thanks for the reply. I did a bit of googling about Barton Regis and found this map of the Gloucestershire Hundreds boundaries in 1832 on wiki looks like my area was in the Barton Regis hundred until pretty recently although this part was mostly rural farms until after WW2 from what I gather.
