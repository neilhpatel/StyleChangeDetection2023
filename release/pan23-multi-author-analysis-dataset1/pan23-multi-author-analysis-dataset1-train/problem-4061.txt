Shortly after , it was announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be visiting Washinon to meet with President Biden and to address Congress in his first trip abroad since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February. The visit comes as Congress is considering an omnibus spending bill that includes $45 billion of emergency assistence to Ukraine, and, , as "... the White House braces for greater resistance from a Republican-controlled House that’s signaled it will put more scrutiny on aid for Ukraine in the new Congress. GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has said his party’s lawmakers will not write a 'blank check' for Ukraine.".
A few minutes later, proud bigot and anti-civil-rights pro-terrorism propagandist Glenn Greenwald sleezes his way on screen and spends a few minutes oozing a word salad about how Putin is right to kill ethnic minorities and try to take over the Orthodox church through puppet proxies to control religion in Ukraine.
So touching. Legit teary eyed from that speech about the hardship and yet firm belief that President Zelenskyy has in the world and Ukraine. Fuck Putin. My heart is with Ukraine.
Perfectly executed speech. He’s bringing up characteristics and virtues that are associated with freedom and democracy in front of repubs say they stand for right before the house flips.
