A) Why would they have ever said they issued new check(s) if the original was truly made out correctly?
That being said, the original check (which we do actually still have) would certainly have been canceled on their end. I'm now at the point where I just need something I can cash, but between them ghosting my messages or just (apparently) failing to mail the new check(s) properly, I've got nothing.
We would try cashing it again, but as you can see in the post, they've insisted several times that they did issue new checks (we just haven't gotten them).
I guess the problem at this point would be that they've long since canceled that original check, which, if what you're saying is true, they shouldn't have done.
B) Since they say that they have, and therefore would have canceled the original check, I still have nothing in hand that I can cash. What do I do?
Banks cannot give account holder information however they can confirm, with you providing identifying information printed on the check, whether the check will clear.
Since you have the original check I suggest calling the issuing bank and verifying it is a valid/non canceled check, and confirming ability to cash it.
Why? Because you asked them so many times that they figured even if you were wrong, you were never going to believe the first check would cash so they gave up and tried again.
