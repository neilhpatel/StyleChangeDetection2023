Of those, however, the vast majority were due to careless or inattentive individuals rather than deliberate actions, enforcement of the regulations could be harsh verging on farcical - a woman was fined Â£1 for displaying what turned out to be the pilot light of her iron as she ironed in the dark, another man was fined 10 shillings for lighting a match to look for his false teeth after they fell out. It was all too easy to break the regulations in communal buildings - if an office worker failed to secure blackout blinds in a window before leaving work then a cleaner coming in after dark would illuminate the area by turning a light on. As well as the ARP warden and their cry of "put that light out!" (a trope firmly based in reality, by all accounts) other citizens were keenly aware that if bombers did see lights everyone in the area could be endangered, and there are records of crowds gathering around houses or shops displaying lights threatening to smash the doors down. Though people could be resentful of overzealous wardens, anyone flagrantly ignoring the blackout would receive little sympathy; if in the vicinity of an important factory or military installation then suspicions of deliberately signalling to the enemy would be much more serious.
British television was shut down during the war. There were only an estimated just before the war, so not many people would have had access anyway. The radio was around though.
