Employees don't have to reveal vaccination status if they don't want to but employers don't have to continue to employ those employees either.
The main point of HIPAA is to prevent medical organizations from sharing private medical information in ways they aren't supposed to. A patient revealing their own medical information is entirely different. Employers in general are not required to adhere to HIPAA, and even where they are, they can simply do that and keep the medical information of their employees secure and not share it, and still have vaccination policies for employment.
Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or youâ€™ve edited your post to comply with the rules, . Do not make a second post or comment.
To supplement what other people have been telling you: no, you have already shared your vaccination / health status with lots of entities already - if you have been enrolled in school anywhere, if you've played sports, and yes also with any employers that implement any kind of health / ability screening.
