The present-day tendency to characterize each decade of the twentieth century with a simple stereotype generally dates back to the early 20th century nostalgia for the "Naughty/Gay Nineties", as I discussed in my answer to.
Hello! While we wait for more targeted answers, I've found a few links to somewhat related answers you might be interested in, as previous questioners have asked a lot about how and why artists in previous centuries chose to depict their subjects faithfully or anachronistically. I hope this helps with your middle question.
In "Les Rois Maudits", a series of historical novels set in 14th century France, it's often mentioned how the rural low nobility usually wore outdated and oldfashioned clothes (as well as armours) compared to the high nobility. They describe it as if the low nobility kept expensive clothes for many years and used them only in important ocassions. Meanwhile, the high nobility, specially in the royal court, or even the growing urban bourgeosie, spent a lot of money in new fashion. This causes that the low nobles are easily identifiable and the high nobles and rich bourgeoises found that amusing. A couple of times the text also describer particularly old characters, even if they're rich, as wearing oldfashioned clothes too. Is this portrayal accurate, even if the tailoring revolution was just beginning to happen? Would there really be enough differences in style already?
That's definitely beyond me, unfortunately. My specialty begins several centuries later, and an answer to that kind of question would require some really intense archival research, and frankly might not even be answerable.
