It seems that the footage was provided to the 6 Jan Committee, for Congressional investigations. Mind you that when the 6 Jan Committee closed due to the end of the 117th Session, that all exhibits and related were submitted to the DOJ and DHS and DNI for National Security reviews - putting it all in the hands of the Executive Branch. I would imagine part of that was to keep the information secure from this upcoming Congressional session.
