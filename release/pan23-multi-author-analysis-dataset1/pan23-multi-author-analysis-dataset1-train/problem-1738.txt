I agree that Putin doesn't want to retreat, but I think there comes a point where he has to. His power over the states in the Russian Federation is not absolute, and they have their own agendas. We're not the only ones looking at the possibility of the federation collapsing, and the states inside it sure as hell do not want to be caught with their pants down if it happens. That means not committing too much of their forces, and especially not committing more than their neighbours/potential post-collapse rivals. Especially not when "committing" increasingly means "throwing away" as Ukraine is turning into a meat grinder for the Russians.
Kidnapping Kidnapping Kidnapping Kidnapping Kidnapping Kidnapping Kidnapping Kidnapping Kidnapping . It's not "deportation. It's not "evacuating w/out parents' consent". I'ts motherfucking kidnapping, call it what it is!
>Russian officials do not deny Ukrainian children are now in Russia, but insist the camps are part of a vast humanitarian project for abandoned, war-traumatized orphans and have been surprisingly public with social media messaging aimed at a Russian audience.
