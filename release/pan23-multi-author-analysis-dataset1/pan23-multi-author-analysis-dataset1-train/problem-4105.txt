The final point is proximity. The US is an ocean removed from Ireland, and the activities of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and other more radical groups were published in the US, but their impact in terms of the lives they took was not explicitly condemned by the press. In Belfast a car bomb would tear through a community, hurting the lives of both Catholic and Protestant alike, but in the US, the bomb could easily be portrayed as just another act of war between two struggling sides. Tom Clancy's Patriot Games is actually very good at depicting this reality, as the official IRA wants nothing to do with the fictional ULA's terrorist activities in the United States for fear of ruining their image. (See, sometimes watching all those action movies can pay off!).
The Anglo-Irish Agreement was even crafted by Boston-area Irish-descended American politicians, further solidifying this connection.
Do you have a source for the 10% number? I always assumed it would be higher than that. 10% with Irish ancestry actually seems quite low, I would think it's more like 20%.
