These are violent protests, not just a bunch of hippies marching for peace and love, they even wanted to take over an airport, they were vandalizing stores, police offices, they set fire to buildings, houses and cars etc and gave beatings to police officers but hey "my Jan 6 copycat" is much worse right?, (Yes mine because I caused it even though I'm a Bolsonaro hater, what a dumbass take) but hey these are all victims right? communists are always the victims even when they do terrible things, somehow they never have to be accountable for anything. Also many deaths have been caused by other protestors or by criminals that always join these movements to cause chaos, but like I said this is okay and righteous since it's the leftists who are doing it and not the right wingers, otherwise hypocrites like you would be outraged at the people protesting and celebrating the deaths of the protesters.
