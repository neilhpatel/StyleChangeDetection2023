The main source of our information about al-Qaeda's planning of the attacks is the interrogation testimony that the captured members of the organization, primarily Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, gave the CIA (under infamously dubious circumstances of coercion), which are presented in a narrative form in the .

Given that to anticipate their collapse would require a detailed understanding of their internal structures and also anticipating exactly what would happen if a jet crashed in to them (the prolonged heating and burning, for example), it seems highly unlikely that he would have been able to predict this without doing extensive studies that it does not seem (at least from the 9/11 Report) that anybody ever contemplated doing, much less actually did. The collapse took the American first responders entirely by surprise, and likely took al-Qaeda by surprise as well.
