Personally, as a Swiss, if I could decide for my country we would already be fighting with Ukraine. Without talk of alliances, just because fighting a genocidal maniac is the right thing to do. I'm disgusted that we aren't doing that, but even more so, I'm disgusted that countries that can't even pretend to a tradition of neutrality aren't doing it either. Do better, world.
Since theyâ€™re a landlocked country in Europe, it would help them decide against taking money from certain international villains, but continue harboring the money of other international villains.
As to why we did ? Blame the pacifist left that managed to have it enshrined in the constitution decades ago that swiss weapons and munitions can't be exported or reexported to any active armed conflict.
So much this. I'm from the Netherlands so we stayed neutral in WW1. So obviously we wanted to be neutral in all wars so we said we would be neutral in WW2. Well it really doesn't work that way. It's a naive point of view pretending there are only good faith actors in this world.
