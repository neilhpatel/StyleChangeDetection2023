This entire op-ed reads much less like a statement of facts and more like what you get from right-wingers on social media who didn't read the Mueller report but rather just watched Tucker Carlson summarize it for them before reading some Facebook memes from pages with names like "Real Patriots 4 Trump and Jesus.".
The Mueller report was damning to Trump in that it specifically did not exonerate a sitting President from Russian collusion while constrained by a directive that he was not allowed to be indicted.
Your links are all vapor. Someone in Trump's campaign talked to a Russian Trump's campaign manager for five months sent polling data to a former client Who might have vaguely-described "intelligence connections" which were never actually established!
That's your reply? You basically just stuck your fingers in your ears while yelling "fake news." I linked to actual, easy-to-read summaries of the Mueller report with descriptions of its actual findings. How is any of that "vapor?" How is any of this simply someone "talking to a Russian?".
