Yes. You parents should have an attorney who does this sort of work. It is \possible\ to do wills yourself (either with or without something like Quicken Willmaker or LegalZoom), but here's the problem with doing that: By the time you discover that you've screwed up, it's too later. As long as your parents do not have some weird situation (like a special-needs child, a lot of real estate or something), this is not expensive. Depending on how busy the lawyer is, it can take a day or two, or it can take a week. You should ask.
I do NOT know California law, or if such a thing would be permissible - but if your parents are dead set on extended family NOT getting custody over you - It wouldn't be a bad idea to give the powers that be the solid reasons WHY in their last will and testament instead of you lobbing allegations you've heard your parents talk about or figure out why all on your own.
I have not seen many 'parents BOTH deceased who gets the kids' situations, mainly it is one parent whose will stated they wanted the child to have contact with X Y Z relative and the surviving parent is taken to court on that basis because they are withholding that... People seem to assume that a will from a parent is a legally binding custody arrangement.. It absolutely IS. NOT. The courts want the kid(s) healthy, sheltered, and stable.. with bonus points if they're also happy.
