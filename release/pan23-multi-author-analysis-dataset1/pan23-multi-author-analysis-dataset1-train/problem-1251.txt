If you petition to be the administrator of the estate, intestate (no will), your sis will have no choice at that point except to present the will to the court in contest to your petition/administration.
Thank you. Our lawyer has explained that and the papers have been sent to legally force my sister to do that. We are about a third of the way to the date she has to present to the will or shut up about it. What is driving us crazy is trying to figure out WHY she would do such a thing as wait. Our mother died in November It isn’t as if my sister doesn’t need even the little bit of money she will get from my mother’s estate. It’s as if she doesn’t realize that the longer she waits, the more she chips away at what little she’ll get. Right now, my husband and I have paid some utility bills, last year‘s taxes (), the citations that were written for the grass being too high, the person we’ve hired to take care of the grass… I don’t know if my sister realizes that, assuming there are no major creditors to take it all away, the money my husband and I have put out is part of what comes off the top before she gets her share.
