In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yep. The only way we get anyone other than McCarthy is to find one of these terrible fucking people that Dems view as a lesser evil who also has enough ambition to risk ending their career by pissing off their own party leadership AND who can convince a handful of their friends to come along with them.
2. Literally my entire post is about how she can both do one (very important) right, at significant personal cost, while also holding other terrible policy views I disagree with. Doesn’t change the fact that she took significant personal risk to do what she’s doing now. People aren’t simple good or bad in the real world.
I would like to see the so-called "Problem Solvers Caucus" - a bipartisan group of Representatives taking pride in solving problems take a shot at this specific problem and put forward a - Republican - compromise candidate for the speakership that would gather enough votes from both sides to ensure a productive US House of Representatives for the next two years.
Disagree. Nobody is passing much of anything regardless with a split Congress. But Cheney (who again, is not who I think Dems will target anyway) would at least avoid some of the Hunter Biden and Fauci bullshit we'll have to endure.
For the third time, I'm not actually advocating for Cheney (mostly just hoping for R dysfunction, tbh). However, the Speaker need not be a member of the House. It can literally be anyone who can get 218 votes. You could be Speaker if you could get the votes.
