i realized that after we bought this house from flippers...the way they designed the kitchen it really looks like our range hood is vented, but i was in the hood fixing something and realized it's just up against the wall, not actually venting...my kitchen walls also aren't insulated properly and the new plumbing is all pex tubing that freezes if it gets under 20 degrees for a prolonged period of time..
Yes. You get pretty much instant heat from the induction stoves too, and temperature control is reproducible across different pots and pans in a way that's a lot tougher with gas stoves.
I prefer the experience on the newer induction stoves to gas. You get really good temperature control for frying, rapid heat adjustments, and the ability to get your pot up to temperature incredibly quickly. It's just a better experience, even when you don't include not having to breathe the fumes.
