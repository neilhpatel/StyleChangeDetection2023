Starting with the Sugar Act in 1764, this might at best be called a special interest tax that specifically targeted the molasses trade. This hardly had a widespread impact, but the fact that it was levied was enough to cause concern. The Stamp Act, in 1765, was far more direct in its taxation. Here, any type of document or otherwise printed material would require to be printed or written on stamped paper. Therefore, a tax was levied on everything from newspapers, college diplomas, attorney licenses, and bonds to playing cards, dices, and even marriage licenses. This would intrude in every aspect of life in Boston, from the "lesser sorts" to the wealthiest of merchants. The Townshend Acts in 1767 levied further taxes a year after the Stamp Act was repealed. Here we again see tax on paper but also on glass, paint, lead, etc.
Very interesting. But what I’m curious to know is what level all these taxes were? Local taxes went up 60% from what base? If total taxes went from 1% to 1.6% of average income that’s different than increasing from 50% to 80% of income.
