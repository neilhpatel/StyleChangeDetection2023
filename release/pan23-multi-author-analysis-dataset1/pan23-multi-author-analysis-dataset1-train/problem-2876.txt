As an Israeli, this story isn't surprising, many Gazans work in Israel and could easily buy lottery ticket. And of course if they win they'll be taxed, like any other winner. It's just Reddit that's convinced that every Palestinian in Israel is murdered on the spot by the army, even though thousands of them work here safely. I see them every day on my way to work.
In British commonwealth nations Gambling outside of casinos is typically a state owned and run monopoly that's ostensibly charitable, giving out grants and such, so winnings aren't taxed like they are in countries where lotteries are private buisness.
Israel is an apartheid. Palestinians in the West Bank get sentenced by an Israeli military court; while Israeli settlers get sentenced by Israeli civilian court. It's needless to say that there's no equality in how Jews and Palestinians are sentenced. Not to mention that Israel is enforcing its racist apartheid laws outside its borders and on Palestinian territories.
Regarding Gaza, you seriously are trying to absolve Israel of all blame? How was Gaza before Hamas rose to power?
