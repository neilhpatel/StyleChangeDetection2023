I like Tom. He reminds me of me. I got my first job at the sheet metal factory at 9. I was running the floor within 6 months. Child labor laws are ruining this country.
Republican. I'm for smaller government programs that are more targeted and nimble enough to handle the ever changing landscape of the problems they're meant to help alleviate. I'm for lower taxes and a simplified process of collecting them and with less loopholes for higher level earners to take advantage of.

If I made a movie that featured a character who is a Republican politician named Chip Perfect who owns a skiing company that employs almost exclusively children, then conservatives would immediately rage and boycott it for the unfair and unrealistically stereotypical portrayal.
Some years I have pretty exponential growth. Other years I do well, just maintaining what I've got. And that's a normal ebb and flow of business, and I don't understand why we as an economy have to collectively shit our pants if we don't always hit quarterly projections. Especially when we do more often than not.
