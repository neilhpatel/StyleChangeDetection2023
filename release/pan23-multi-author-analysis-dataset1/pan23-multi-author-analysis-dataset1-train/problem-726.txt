It's a direct response on your last bit about the confusion between anti Zionism not being the same thing as being anti jewish, going further to show anti Zionism is unneeded and misguided, as what passes for the current Israel's "Zionism" is a grift, and so far removed from actual Zionism, it's practically unrecognizable to Zionists like Albert Einstein, and those other American Jews who wrote the open letter to the New York times in 1948 warning about 'Conservative Zionism".
