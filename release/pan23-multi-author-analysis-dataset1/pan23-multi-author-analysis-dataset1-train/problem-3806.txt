The last serious proposal was 2000 Camp David, where Palestinians got pretty much everything they could hope for, and they refused it with no counter offer.
If Palestinian leadership came out right now and said they are ready to accept peace proposal as given during Camp David, it would be VERY hard for Israel to refuse.
Also Palestinians agreeing to two state solution and moving on with their lives in peace is not a "surrender.".
The last peace proposal was Israel annexing half the West Bank and giving Palestine little actual sovereignty with no way to guarantee that Israel would abide by its responsibilities.
Anger??!? I am the one that should be angry, 30 thousand years ago my ancestors used that area as out religious centerpiece. Long before the jews and muslims did. Both are desecrating my heratige and baiting me with their disrespect......anyone else think religion should be taught only to adults and not have children indoctrinated into the bullshit? I bet it solves all sorts of problems when that happens.
