Depending on where they are, they can fire you for getting a ride with your coworkers. There might be a good reason, or there might be a ridiculous (or no) reason. Where are you?
As to the larger issue that you believe they are trying to force you to quit, that could potentially be an issue if they are trying to force you out for an illegal reason, such as illegal discrimination based on your membership in a protected class, or as retaliation for exercising your rights under the law (taking FMLA leave, filing a worker's compensation claim, filing a wage claim with the state or federal Department of Labor, engaging in protected concerted activity protected by the NLRA, etc.). Outside of that, it's not generally illegal to give an employee more work or make it more difficult for them to report to work by prohibiting carpooling, though.
Prohibiting you from carpooling with your coworkers is legal; employment in Illinois is at-will and there are no state or federal laws that would make it illegal to discipline or fire you for that activity.
