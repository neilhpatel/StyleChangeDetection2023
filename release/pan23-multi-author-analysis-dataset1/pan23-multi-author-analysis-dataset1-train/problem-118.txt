I have always had great reviews, I have several thank you letters from clients written to management about working with me and my costumer service. I worked days, nights, weekends. When I tell you I ate,slept and breathed work, I mean it. I am a great worker and excellent employee. Very knowledgeable in my field. But it sounds like I should feel lucky I got a severance package at least and laid off and not fired. Just feels awful that I could be a rockstar and get laid off as a result.
Assuming you're in the US, you are most likely an at-will employee, and as such can legally be terminated at any time, for any reason besides illegal discrimination on the basis of your membership in a protected class (or for taking certain protected actions, such as attempting to unionize, etc.). It's generally legal for an employer to lay someone off by "eliminating their position" and then hire someone else for that same role, as long as it's not done to disguise an illegal termination.
Thank you, I will do that. I just wonder why choose me? and if I was a good employee. Why guise it as eliminating my position and then post the same position.
