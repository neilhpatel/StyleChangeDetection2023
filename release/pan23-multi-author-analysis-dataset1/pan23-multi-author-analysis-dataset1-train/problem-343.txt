The nurse on duty should have verified the bracelet info and recognized that 1) an orderly returned the patient to the wrong room, 2) patient placed in room was not patient listed in room, and 3) as a result of 1 and 2, patient was receiving the wrong treatment and medicine meant for someone else.

Finally, Staph infections are also incredibly common. Hospitals fight like hell to keep these from happening, but staph is literally everywhere. What is unfortunate for your father is that it took root in a dangerous way. To find this as an actionable legal issue, you really would have to show that the hospital was neglectful in their sterilization and sanitation practices when it comes to your father. And that isn’t particularly common. It’s one of the reasons hospitals have that certain smell. It’s all that effort to fight spread of these common but dangerous pathogens.
Hospital-acquired infections are an unfortunate but well known side-effect of hospitalizations and especially surgeries. I would be very surprised if your dad did not sign something acknowledging risk of infection prior to his surgery.
