Listen the check cleared they even issued me a cashiers check that was deposited into my personal account because they closed by business account they waited until the check cleared to issue the cashier check and close the account ok the funds were pulled from my partners account the very day after my deposit and held for 7 days until releasing in my account there is no issue with the money clesring the issue is where they lied and said the money came from that my partner has.
You keep saying they "lied", but this implies intent and a reason to do so. But what would be the motive?
It seems to be one person in the holds department doing this first said the check wouldnt clear it was coming back nsh then someone else from the department saw it did clear they waited the max time due to the hold the first person put on the check once it had definitely cleared the hold person whoever this is closed my account for high risk and issued me a cashier check the banker i went in to see suggested I deposit it into my personal account since it was still open after i did that the hold department closed ny personal account and said this very much so lie about my partner who issued the original check that cleared funds were refund fraud by banker is working to see why they said that based off contacting my partners bank who verified recent activity on his account and there was a tax refund his bank said nothing about fraud and he is having no problems with his bank.
There was obviously some issue. And them releasing funds is not indicative of the check clearing. By regulation, banks are required to make funds available sooner than a check would actually clear the system (which, for checks, is still fairly archaic).
