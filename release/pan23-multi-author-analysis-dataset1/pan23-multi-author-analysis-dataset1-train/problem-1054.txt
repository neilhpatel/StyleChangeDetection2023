I filed out the forms for breaking a lease due to domestic violence and also emailed the property manager proof of my police report. A victims of crime advocate had also written her a letter regarding my lease termination and she had it verified. She told me that she’d have their lawyer look over it then get back to me. Weeks later I received no response so I emailed for an update then later received and email asking for November’s rent. The property manager.
1.  Notwithstanding any provision in a rental agreement to the contrary, if a tenant, cotenant or household member is the victim of domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault or stalking, the tenant or any cotenant may terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord written notice of termination effective at the end of the current rental period or 30 days after the notice is provided to the landlord, whichever occurs sooner.
