1. underline the "literary class" bit of this answer, because I think it's fairly key - this (like an awful lot of religious texts) isn't exactly doing the same things we often expect religious texts to do. Even biblical prophecy isn't foretelling the future in the way it's commonly thought of doing now. Our way of defining what a prophecy is is very shaped by Calvinist and fundamentalist notions about literal interpretations and scriptural imagery. (Sheer coincidence, but in the next tab to this on my browser, there's - with some lit theory recs for analysis.).
Now firstly, whenever we’re dealing with the viking era of early middle ages, it’s always important to keep the following disclaimer in mind as stated by r/steelcan909: “We dont know what we think we know about Norse mythology, and it's impossible to try and extrapolate from the material that we do have to other cultures" So keep this in mind as the following answer will be based on the only source capable of somewhat answering it, which is the origin of the Ragnarok myth itself: The Icelandic Sagas.
