So where I'm at in the US, a bunch of houses burned in forest fires. The locals that lost their homes are pissed that they can't get permits to rebuild, but some of the reasons for it are 1) the roads where they're located are to narrow for fire trucks to get to 2) they were unpermitted in the first place 3) landslide risks.
Yeah I get that. It looks like there's tiebacks, however, without securing the base of the wall, it's always going to give way because that's the area of greatest pressure. So the bottom will give way and by laws of gravity everything above it will too. In summary, tiebacks are useless unless the base of the wall is secure. This is day one of retaining wall design.
Just gonna throw this out there, I support the change in pronunciation if that’s the will of the modern Turkish folk… and that being said: Benjamin Franklin initially supported the Turkey as the national bird of the US, which was later replaced with the bald Eagle a trash gobbling Eagle (just saying it’s true ask a Canadian), and have you ever messed with a flock of Turkeys? No you probably haven’t because they have exactly zero fear and will Zerg rush you, immediately.
