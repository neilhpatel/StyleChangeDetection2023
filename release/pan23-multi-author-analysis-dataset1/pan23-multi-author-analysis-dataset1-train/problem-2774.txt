Sounds like your history textbook fell hard into what is commonly referred to as the Black Legend. Briefly, the Black Legend holds that colonization by Spain in the New World was disproportionately violent and devastating to Native Americas, especially when compared to the relatively benign and enlightened colonization attempts of the Dutch, French, and English. Accounts like Bartolom√© de las Casas A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies were reprinted for Dutch, English, and German readers and were widely circulated for, as you said, propaganda purposes and stirring up anti-Catholic sentiment.
Thank you for those details. I knew the English were definitely not benign when it came to native populations. What about the French, though? I've always heard they tried to trade with the natives and were therefore more peaceful with them. Is this correct or more glossing over?
Even as a Floridian who is fairly well educated on all parts of this state's history I never realized that the depopulation of native peoples was so heavily impacted by the English slave trade (it was always implied that the Spanish simply shipped them off to other colonies, that the people assimilated into the Spanish culture or that they died of disease).
No worries! Before I started reading about the indigenous slave trade I had no idea Florida had such a violent colonial history. This isn't something commonly taught in school, but thankfully the impact of indigenous slavery is starting to become more mainstream.
