I don’t think they can justify changing their position at this point, despite their most loyal demographic shrinking due to age, COVID, and lack of “new blood” identifying as Republican. Besides, why would young voters, who are consistently Dem/Prog/Lefty voters, trust R’s after decades of seeing how much Republicans hate anyone under 50. R’s are too prideful and enamored with their own propaganda to ever willingly admit failure or weakness. So doubling down it will be until the RNC shutters it’s doors once and for all. Sooner, I hope, rather than later.

Anyone who expected different doesn’t realize the republicans are weaponizing religion. They’ve been on this path for 40 years, one modest midterm isn’t going to sway the everything.
