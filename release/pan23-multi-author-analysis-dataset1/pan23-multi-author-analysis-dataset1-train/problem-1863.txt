These are the people who get out and want to get out and as such, are going to be very culturally aligned with us, but that's not the case for so much of the peasantry that is stuck in pissed off old school religious conservatism, thats only gotten worse as the Gulf Arab states and Iran funded and pushed their respective backwards interpretations of Islam all over the world.

Muhammad was a tribal warlord who executed enemy soldiers, forced women and children of his defeated enemies into slavery, permitted slavery and sexual rights over slaves including a concubine slave gifted to him who gave birth to his child, and also started having sexual intercourse with his child bride when she was just 9 years old, amongst a lot of other horrible things.
