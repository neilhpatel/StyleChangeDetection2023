In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Nope. You're right on all counts. This is a privilege that should not be taken for granted. America got too comfortable with it and lost its collective soul. Every. Single. Vote. Counts.
I still believe that we should be exclusively defending Senate seats if we want to prevent control from going back to Mitch McConnell come 2025, but I have zero doubt that the Texas Democrats will put their best foot forward this cycle should they manage to recruit and nominate Colin Allred.
Ya know. We take a huge shit on Texas every single day here in /r/politics. Letâ€™s talk more about the lazy New York democrats, who let a complete pathological liar get elected, and basically cost us control of the house with their complete ineptitude.
