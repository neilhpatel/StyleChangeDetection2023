Eg, Congress could legislate that states have to allow straight-ticket voting, universal mail-in/absentee voting, however many days of early voting, RCV or some other voting system, etc. It would be limited to only Congressional and Presidential elections, wouldn't apply to any state or local office elections, but would still be an improvement at least. There might be some way to incentivize states to adopt these reforms for other elections by offering funding to help pay for election administration and tying it to voluntarily applying it to state elections as well.
Wait. You mean 6 years from now I won't have to vote for Warnock 2 times again just a month apart? I mean I really enjoyed checking his name 4 times over 2 years. What a fucking concept.

Absolutely. Everybody here thinking ranked choice voting is gonna be the next implemented system is going to be sorely disappointed. The GOP fully controls the state apparatus in GA and they don't want 2 Democratic Senators again.
