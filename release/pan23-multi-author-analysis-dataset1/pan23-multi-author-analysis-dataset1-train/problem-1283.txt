A large internal fuel capacity (224 gallons for a P-51C compared to 85 gallons for the Spitfire IX) plus drop tanks was certainly helpful, but the Mustang's fundamental design was extremely aerodynamically clean, and had two particular features that maximised fuel efficiency. The first was the positioning of the radiator, mid-fuselage with an under-belly air inlet and carefully designed ducting that provided a small amount of thrust (a phenomenon known as the Meredith effect), resulting in a highly efficient cooling system. The Mustang also had laminar-flow wings, an aerofoil shape that minimised drag, though I gather they didn't achieve true laminar flow in practise (I'm no aerodynamicist, the full explanations seem to involve a lot of graphs and equations, see e.g. NASA's Quest for Performance: The Evolution of Modern Aircraft). When coupled with the Merlin engine the result was the .
Interesting. Thanks. I mean looking at performances compared to other planes it seems the mustang compares very favorably to other ally, axis and even another American designs, but the vastly better range makes the mustang a no-brainer superior fighter or am I missing something?Why make other fighter planes then, why not just pump out mustangs? Were there any clear advantages other contemporary fighter aircraft had over the mustang as a reason why the US didn’t just pump out this design or it wasn’t copied?
