It's the Declarational ideas of "equality between citizens" and "national self-determination" that contributed to the French Revolution, the independence of the Spanish New World, and the much later wave of 20th century decolonization.
The Supreme Court is a bit more complicated. The Supreme Court was not even mentioned in the original Constitution (The BNA Act), it was created under Alexander Mackenzie - the second prime minister. As a matter of statute, a third of the seats on the Supreme Court have been reserved for Quebecois lawyers or judges. However, as a matter of custom, the other seats are also divided up geographically: with 3 judges from Ontario, 2 from the western provinces and 1 from the east. The composition of the Supreme Court was constitutionalized in 1982 (as changing the composition of the Supreme Court required a constitutional amendment) and the Supreme Court even rejected the appointment of a judge who, while a judge from Quebec, was from the 'wrong court' (he was a judge on the Federal Court of Appeal).
