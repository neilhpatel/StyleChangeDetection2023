It really, is a war of attrition and the article wanting the Ukrainians to change their strategy by spring is arrogant at best because it takes time for troops to know how this equipment is used and changing general and commanders strategies can be like teaching a old dog new tricks. As habits are hard to break in military doctrine and strategy. Not to mention the logistics of the million dollar equipment Ukraine is getting.
Dude... Obviously. It may be inefficient, but it's certainly useful. These "scrap planes" were originally constructed for recon work, but recently they've been producing them at a steady pace in order for them to work in tandem with drones (air-dropping grenades, supplies, etc).
True. I think everyone expected them to completely overwhelm Ukraine in the air and have control of the skies similar to what we saw with US-Iraq 2003.
Seemed like they took more casualties during the initial invasion from Ukrainian anti air systems and decided to not try any major air campaigns again.
