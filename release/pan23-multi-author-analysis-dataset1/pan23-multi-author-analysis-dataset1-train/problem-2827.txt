The irony is getting a little warmer might make Russia a bit more liveable. Putin will not live to see it.
1/ The Wagner Group's apparent success in capturing Soledar appears to have been a Pyrrhic victory, with the mercenaries suffering such massive casualties that their future and ability to recover are now reportedly in doubt. ⬇️.
its insanely stupid because even if we take a trip to the fantasy world where ukraine launched a missile at this apartment building, it is still a reflection of russian failure that they didn't prevent this (as they were ostentatiously protecting "little russians" from the "kiev puppet regime of the big bad gay west) after almost a year into this little operation and a freaking mobilization. They failed even in fantasy.
UPDATE "Soledar is controlled by Ukrainian authorities, our military controls it," regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on national television, but "battles continue in and outside of the city." He added that Soledar and nearby Bakhmut are the "hottest" spots on the frontline.
This isn't new unfortunately. Certain types of "leftists" basically sided with Assad in Syria against anarcho-communist Kurdish militias in the name of "anti imperialism". The reason? The Kurds and US found themselves on the same side on something and were working together. Considering that it is unsurprising these types have also basically sided with mafia capitalist Russia in a blatant war of aggression. I have an internal bet that they will soon be decrying the socialist Lula in Brazil because the US has stated their support of him. Lunacy.
Always strong support of the UK is now impenetrable and ready for challenges. In a conversation with the Prime Minister, @RishiSunak, I thanked for the decisions that will not only strenhen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners.
