Grad school in history is much less about the actual history and much more on the historiography. You have to learn what has been written before you can write your own stuff. So try to get a handle on that. How? Figure out which journals are the Big Important Journals™ in the field and hit a library to read them. Find articles by Big Important Scholars™ and devour them. Look for review articles (articles that review multiple books at once) and learn the ways in which the books fit into the historiography. You will spend much of your time in grad school writing historiographical essays. Reading a bunch of them beforehand will make you familiar with the style and techniques used.
Leonid D. Grenkevich, The Soviet partisan movement, 1941–1944 : a critical historiographical analysis.
How? Find a textbook. Look up texts on the era, then google the authors to find out what they do. If the authors are all focused on, for example, the history of war, you can bet the text will be, too. Maybe skip that one. If the authors' work has focused on race, class, or gender issues, that text may be your winner.
Likewise, Turpin might be a remembrance of an archbishop of Rheims in the same period that probably never left Francia proper and, from a bishop closest to the circles of eccelesiastical and royal power, became a fighting saint (closer to the epic expectations of the XIth century); or Ogier de Danemarche who might come from a contemporary namesake from...Arduenna's march.
