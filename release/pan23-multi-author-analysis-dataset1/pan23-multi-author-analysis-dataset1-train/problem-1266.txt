As others have said, these are the same thing, or essentially the same thing. The mortgage note is how you get on the mortgage. Sort of like a plane tickets is how you get on a plane. You can't buy a plane ticket, not get on the plane, and then claim to be in Denver in four hours. Maybe a poor analogy, more like showing I.D. is the analog to executing.
What you are being told is that the VA (and likely other mortgage brokers) will not write the loan when someone not a signatory to the "Deed of Trust" (showing responsibility to pay) is on the "General Warranty Deed" (showing ownership interest) because the VA does not have the ability foreclose on their interest in the property.
What people are saying is that the VA will not grant a loan when another person will be on the deed (showing ownership of the land) but not on the loan, because the VA has no right to that person's interest in the property, like they have with people who sign the loan documents.
You are saying you want the other person to be on the "General Warranty Deed" showing they have ownership in the property along with you, but NOT the "Deed of Trust" making them responsible for repayment of the loan.
You are also being told that if you go through the loan process and file the "General Warranty Deed" in just your name and then file a "Quit Claim Deed" transferring some of your interest in the property to another person, the VA will likely immediately foreclose for fraud and demand full payment of the lien.
It will be. It's not illegal to be on the deed without being on the mortgage/note, or vice versa. But trying to do that can trigger a clause where the entire mortgage is due at once, in some situations. It's a situation requiring a lot of careful planning.
