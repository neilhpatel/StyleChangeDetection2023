What are people in the West going to do when there begin to be conversations about which community gets its water shut off first?
California? Last I heard they have a problem with NIMBYs blocking desalination development because most plants don't take care of the brine discharge. It adds more cost.
Also conservation. No growing strawberries in the desert. No building homes in the desert. Water use in CA could be cut by 50% in homes, industry and ag so the problem is solved from two directions. Conservation and desalinization.
No it doesn't. It's a bad opinion article. If people in Arizona want more water they will need to force farmers and ranchers to use less. Same for California.
Cali and Colorado say otherwise. They have receipts to back that up. At least Cali does I havenâ€™t looked at Colorado who uses the 2nd most amount of water from the Colorado River System.
