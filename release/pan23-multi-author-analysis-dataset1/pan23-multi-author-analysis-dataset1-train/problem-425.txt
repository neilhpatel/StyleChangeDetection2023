Regardless of whether the forgiven amount is taxed as income, anyone whose debt is reduced will have more to spend on goods and services, growing the state's economy, which will also generate tax revenue, independent of whether a state gets any revenue directly from the forgiveness.
125K. I thought we didn't qualify since my husband's and I's income combined was just over 125K. But it turns out it's 125K for an individual but 250K for a household. I was so excited I told my husband we qualified and he said, "I don't know, I would rather us make over 250K and not qualified." LOL. But we'll take it. That would reduce my school debt to just 2K and since they froze payments since the pandemic, I've saved enough to pay that off. I got an email just yesterday that my application was approved. We still are paying off medical debt accrued when my son was born premature and had a bunch of procedures done and my husband was an independent contractor and there was no Obamacare so we were rejected for every insurance plan we applied to due to my son's "preexisting condition". Once Obamacare hit, he was covered and the hemorrhaging of money stopped. He's a teen now and healthy and happy but we're still paying from that time. I love Obama because Obamacare saved us from going into bankruptcy. If this loan forgiveness passes, I will be the first person to be excited about the Biden presidency. LOL JK. I think he has been doing a good job.
Republicans are anti education. If you were incentivized to go to college to get an education there's a good chance you wouldn't vote for them anymore. Educated people generally don't vote Republican.
