Currently working on a masters of World War 2 Studied and this term covers the decision to use the bombs. I would suggest reading Richard B. Frank's Downfall and Tsuyoshi Hasegawa's Racing the Enemy as well. Frank is more pro while Hasegawa is more against. On mobile, so unable to italicize titles.
Of course, I am also bringing my own interpretation to this, as someone who has now spent over a decade talking to various people (including non-Americans) about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and how it is taught today, and what lessons are explicitly drawn out of the teaching, etc.
The fact that many teachers (and journalists, and certainly politicians) do not even know about the complexities of the atomic bomb's history, and the historical problems of interpretation and so on, doesn't help any of this. It becomes a self-reinforcing issue even if people have good intentions about it. I am not saying that everyone teaching this history this way believes this is what they are doing, or is self-consciously aware that this is how it has become deployed. But this is my sense of how it is deployed in the American context, and what this deployment ultimately does for the sensibility of Americans.
