Firstly, though Czechoslovakia had an impressive advanced industrial economy, and could produce her own tanks, artillery, and aircraft, it would be unwise to exaggerate its vitality. The Czechs were still woefully inferior to the Germans in terms of industry and economy. For example in the year 1938 Germany had a GDP of $351.4 billion, representing nearly nine-percent of the global total. Against this the Czechs compared unfavorably with but $30.3 billion comprising slightly less than one-percent of the world's total.
Lastly, Czechoslovakia was not ethnically homogeneous. Finland with its various minorities was more homogeneous. While the majority of Germans lived in the Sudetenland, there were Germans living all over Bohemia and Moravia. There was not such administrative unit as Sudetenland. There were German language islands (Jihlava, Svitavy), or Czech islands within territories ceded to Germany. Or you had a German speaking city totally surrounded by the Czech suburbs and countryside. Brno itself had about 1/3 of German population. Therefore, the war with Germany would be extremely difficult due the fact, that there were Germans living within, and would and were undermining the republic's readiness within.
