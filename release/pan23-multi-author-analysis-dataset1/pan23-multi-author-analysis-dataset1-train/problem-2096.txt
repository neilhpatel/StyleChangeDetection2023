> The progress of cotton in men's and women's (but mostly the latter) wardrobes went in fits and starts. The calico craze and the Neoclassical revival best fit the concept of a revolution, but it's less that their development caused a change (except with regard to the switch from cotton to linen underclothing) and more that social factors - arbitrary ones, to an extent - caused them to become more interesting to merchants and manufacturers, with repercussions down the road.
Wait, wait, wait. From what I understood, in the XVII and XVIII centuries the Cotton was more popular simply becouse it was fashionable? That having the foreign materials was more prestigious than using local wool and other local materials? I mean, I don't have the same mentality as those people, but god damn, I feel like this is not a good enough reason. I'm also suprised by Government's actions, it strenhened the economy of colonial regions while hurting the locals, right? How do you justify such action? And later on it simply was better in the industrialized world, that's actually understable I guess. And thank you for the information!
