However what is a more important reason is the historiography of the continent. First of all I would like to say that Egypt is part of North Africa, but often seen apart from it. From the renaissance onwards we, as in people who live in the "western" world, have seen the Roman and Greek ancient world as the establishment of "civilization". As they did not really spread further than past the Sahara northern Africa has always been of interest of "western" historians. Then from development of the age of sails and exploration onwards Euopreans were the ones exploring and thereby creating an idea of superioriy, which led to them colonizing continents. around them. The best indicator of this is the trade of enslaved people, which were mostly taken from Africa, but there are a lot of displaced people from Asia and South America as well. The enslaved people were seen as second rank humans and could therefore be traded. This European Idea of superiority also leaked through the ideas of historians and archaeologists of the time.
Thank you. Follow-up questions, do we know about where some of these most important records and being kept and are there reliable sources to learn more about African history that isn’t necessarily widely known but still has historical evidence and/or records available?
Hi there! You’ve asked a question along the lines of ‘why didn’t I learn about X’. We’re happy to let this question stand, but there are a variety of reasons why you may find it hard to get a good answer to this question on /r/AskHistorians.
