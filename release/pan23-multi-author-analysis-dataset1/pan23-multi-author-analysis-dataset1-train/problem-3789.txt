Lech vs Greenwood village (see "Arrest of Robert Seacat") is a pretty high profile case of the Police doing what they wanted to apprehend a suspect, and not adequately making reparations to bystanders. In this incident, a family went out, came back to find their home had been essentially pulled apart, shot up and blown up. Later when the arrest was concluded, they couldn't even enter the property to reclaim personal possessions under threat of arrest themselves (property was condemned, dangerous). Police offered $5,000 in compensation for over $400,000 of damage. As things stand, the Lech's are nearly $30k in the hole on legal fees, and have been paid nothing by the Police because according to the courts "police cannot be "burdened" with the consideration of collateral property damage when performing their duties.".
No random redditor could offer an informed opinion on your specific situation without familiarity with the specific facts of your case.
It's a double edged sword. You shouldn't hinder the police service by imposing financial restrictions or incentives on the crimes they pursue ("I gave up chasing the armed suspect, as they entered a high value building, and any collateral would have been too high") but also you don't want situations like the above to arise.
NAL. Just a note to remember that Quebec uses Civic law, whereas the rest of Canada uses common law, so take all advice with a grain of salt that the system is different here in Quebec.
