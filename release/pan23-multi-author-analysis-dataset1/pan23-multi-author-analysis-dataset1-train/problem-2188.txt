If you don't mind a follow-up question, as far as I know, the bible depicts two major deportations of the Jewish people, One during the Assyrian captivity and the other during the Babylonian captivity. How much evidence is there for either of them?
The early king's of the separate kingdoms of Israel and Judah are not independently attested either, but beginning in the 9th Century BCE, we begin seeing independent confirmation of Biblical figures more and more, to the degree that we can reasonably say that the unattested kings and events between independently confirmed kings were probably historical. The earliest example of this is Omri, the founder of the dynasty that usurped Israel from the House of David according to the Bible. Very few outside documents refer to the Kingdom of Israel. Instead, they refer to the House of Omri when referencing the northern kingdom, including the Mesha Stele and several Assyrian monuments. Omri is not personally referenced in any extra-Biblical documents. However, his son, Ahab, was listed by Shalmeneser III of Assyria on the Kurkh Monoliths.
