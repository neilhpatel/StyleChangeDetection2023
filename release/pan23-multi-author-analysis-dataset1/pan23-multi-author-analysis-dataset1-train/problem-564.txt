Liberal and conservative are supposed to mean is liberal means new ideas and conservative means traditional. That's the SINGLE binding point of meaning that makes those terms matter. That's why you have labels like Democratic and Republicans, so the labels can switch but the core ideological terms don't. You can't be a conservative liberal, you're just using the words wrong at that point because you can't be pro-tradition and pro-progress.
Using the word liberal to try to mean traditionalist is nothing by a disinformation attempt or sheer ignorance. Those words have real meanings beyond politics and that's why they are useful, they span time while the labels flip flop.
Well, in this case the word liberal and conservative are being used wrong, because they are not political labels. The party names are the political labels open to changing definitions, not the terms conservative and liberal.
Liberal = Progressive (again fairly verbose and hard to steal the label if you're a traditionalist/conservative/person who wants minimal change).
Good. Australian politics is fucking bonkers. The fact they ban porn where women have small tits is so insane to me. Old men projecting their shit on things, whilst shaming women for a complex tons of them have when they shouldn't.
