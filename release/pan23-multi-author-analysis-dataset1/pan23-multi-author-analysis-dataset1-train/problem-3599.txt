Is it correct to say, even after the Soviet invasion and two atomic bombs, the war faction still wanted additonal conditions beyond just keeping the imperial system in place? And that the empreror had to break the deadlock?
Basically, yes. At the Imperial Conference of August 9-10, the Emperor had all but ordered the Cabinet to accept the Potsdam terms with the additional term of retention of the Imperial Polity. That Imperial Conference only came about through subterfuge by the peace faction. Sakomizu had collected the signatures of the Cabinet under the pretense that it would be required to declare war on the Soviets. The Imperial Conference of the 14th was called by the Emperor, which was the first time this happened under Hirohito. Anami and the war faction felt that the Allied reply was insufficient. The idea that the future government would be determined by "the freely expressed will of the Japanese people" made them feel that the Imperial polity could be replaced. This led the war faction to again call for the additional conditions, but the Emperor again ordered them to accept the terms, saying that he would not want to be Emperor if it was not the will of the people of Japan. But again, any additional conditions were never communicated to the Allies.
