I heard it was the opposite. Every time they used the term UFO, even if it was technically a UFO, people who don't believe in aliens would assume they were talking about aliens and refused to take the issue seriously. This is of course a problem when you're talking about potentially hostile aircraft from China / Russia / wherever entering our airspace but you don't know what the object is because radar can only detect that there is an object, not what it looks like.
Exactly. Probabilities are great and all, but realistically lots of countries could be the culprit here. Everyone talking about China and WW3.
Andy alien species capable of casually traveling vast interstellar distances likely has absolutely nothing to fear from us and likely knows enough about first contact situations to not just sort of conspiculously float around in low orbit while remaining silent, especially in the extraordinarily unlikely event a modern ballistic missile presents a credible threat.
"No. We're not going to earth because 5 of their ten highest grossing films are about murdering aliens!".
