Moreover, the concession was not, at least from the Soviet point of view, entirely arbitrary or unjustified. While Stalin's doctrine of Socialism in One Country dampened this somewhat, the early Soviet ideal of a "union of nations" still did persist to some extent by 1945. Under this model, the USSR was a free association of sovereign countries who joined together out of ideological brotherhood -- indeed, Lenin's 1917 Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia^ even included a right of secession, one which was quickly (and surprisingly, to the Bolsheviks) exercised by many outlying regions. Beyond that, the Soviet Union did put some effort into 'legitimizing' the independent status of the republics; most notably, the constitutions of both Ukraine^ and Belarus^ guaranteed the republics the right to handle their own foreign relations and maintain standing armies, the two features then considered necessary for statehood.
Very interesting thank you. Follow up question : How the soviet justified that Ukraine and Belarus got a seat, but not their other republics, which afaik where considered equally "sovereign"?
