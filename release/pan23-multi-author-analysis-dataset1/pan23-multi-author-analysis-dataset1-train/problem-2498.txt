If this was rent that you paid after moving and the landlord was "double dipping" on rent collection, you could have a case. But the fee wasn't rent, but rather a condition to break the lease. You aren't entitled to it back.
If for any reason, the Apartment is vacated or abandoned by Residents prior to the Ending Date without payment of Rent through the Ending Date and fulfillment of all other obligations under this Lease Agreement, the Residents shall also pay an early lease termination fee of four (4) months’ Rent and pay back any incentive, special, and promotion reflected on the Lease Agreement. The Residents may reduce the four (4) month early lease termination fee by providing at least sixty (60) day notice, in writing, to Landlord, pay an early lease termination fee of two (2) months Rent after vacating or abandoning the Apartment and pay back any incentive, special, and promotion reflected on the Lease Agreement. The Landlord shall determine the actual date of vacating or abandonment upon the receipt of all the keys to the Apartment”.
