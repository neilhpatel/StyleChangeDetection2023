Focus on cementing Democrat gains on states like Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Michigan and try to bring Wisconsin and North Carolina in the Blue side.
But GOP won the Supreme Court in NC and Ohio - and they will gerrymander again (their current maps are "temporary" because they delayed enough so that there was no court-approved map), which means an even more uphill battle for Democrats to win House seats there in 2024.
They're like cats. They complain about a system that they don't understand at all, and are completely reliant on in every way.
Nebraska state legislature went filibuster proof majority for republicans yesterday. Throw in a batshit crazy Governor and itâ€™s not looking so hot for abortions in our state. At least we got $15 minimum wage last night ðŸ¥² small wins where we can.
I also have to wonder if we are likely headed for a potential nightmare for Republicans wherein Trump is defeated in the primary and runs as an independent, effectively guaranteeing a Republican loss for 2024. If his party defeats him, he will absolutely try to take them down with him.
