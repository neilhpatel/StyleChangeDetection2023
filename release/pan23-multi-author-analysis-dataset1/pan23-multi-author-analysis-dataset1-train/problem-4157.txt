Or China wants concessions from the US or the EU (like better tariffs) and therefore threatens with helping the Russian war effort. Given the manufacturing capabilities of China, it could be a very serious threat. From ammo to thermal cameras or drones, China could really outsupply western countries if it wants to. Not being a democracy helps with kind of decisions...
The selection of higher quality, more effective, and longer lasting (and therefore more cost-effective in the long-term) products is getting both smaller and more expensive every day, but that is because 99% of the time, no matter how much spare money they have, people will always buy a combination of the cheapest and most aggressively marketed (to their tastes) product, and completely disregard quality, service, and effectiveness. Guess what happens? More companies reduce and/or eliminate their products in the "quality" and "value" (value, not "cheap") segments. The less you make/distribute/sell of something, the less efficient, and the costlier it becomes. And the cycle continues.
