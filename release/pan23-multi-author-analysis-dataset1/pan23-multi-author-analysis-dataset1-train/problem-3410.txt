The estate needs to be probated in order to transfer title. This isn't something that you or your parents can do. The personal rep of the estate, presumably your mother's friend, needs to be the one to deal with it. You can't apply for title without proof of transfer, which cannot be performed without the estate PR doing so on behalf of the estate.
If nobody put the estate in probate and became PR, there simply is nobody who has the lawful agency to transfer the title, so it can't be done. Unfortunately, it isn't legal to drive unless it's transfered into your husband's name and registered, so you may be right that scrapping it is the only real option.
Thank you. This makes sense. They did not have a probate as far as I know. I will ask tomorrow at a more reasonable hour (from all of our discussions I do not believe they did). Guy was a hermit after the divorce. It's interesting learning these things because my own mom died and I have never heard of probate before. Then again I was in maintenance of her affairs and POA. Ugh.
