If you are in breach, generally the seller needs to give you notice to perform, then a few days later they can terminate the sale and keep your earnest money.
If the seller doesn't close in time they are in breach. You should talk to a real estate attorney about how pursuing specific performance, or a lawsuit for damages works out in practice. If the seller has a much higher offer you could work out a settlement to release your contract. Or it could really be worth the time and expense of a lawsuit if they just refuse to sign for no reason other than greed. But it would take weeks or months if they just refuse to sign.
The more important issue is you'd likely be limited to damages equal to your buyer's deposit (language should already guarantee that you receive all initial deposits), but that spent money would have to be directly related to the transaction: Survey costs, appraisal costs, roof inspections, chimney/fire place inspections, pest inspections, etc.
Can he still take my earnest money? Because the way it sounds, he wants to go with a backup offer that may have been higher than mine, per that recording my dad did.
