Okay, so the modifications are in fact something the insurance has to consider in replacement value. Modifications are part of the vehicle generally, rather than personal property, which isn't always covered in theft. USUALLY, which I write in big letters because it's important to know it's a bit fact specific as to what exact mods and the coverage, but it isn't a matter of the vehicle without modifications as what she's owed. It's the cost to replace what was lost.
From my understanding, it’s more of a ‘General Release from Liability’, basically protecting them from a 3rd party gaining access to the property and burglarizing, vandalizing, or straight up stealing your car - now if it’s found that anything that happens to your car is a direct result of the dealerships’ poor judgement, or they willingly allowed something to happen, or something happened as a direct result of an employee (mis-filling papers, breaking a window while installing tint, scratching the paint while cleaning it, etc.), that the dealership could be held liable, and would be claimed against their Liability Insurance (there’s a reason most states require a business to hold this). According to , however, MD is a “pure contributory negligence fault state. The plaintiff must be 100% free of fault to recover damages.” {basically, they don’t require businesses to hold Liability Insurance} 🤦🏼‍♂️.
