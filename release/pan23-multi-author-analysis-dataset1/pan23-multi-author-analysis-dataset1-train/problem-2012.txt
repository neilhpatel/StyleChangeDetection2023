I’ve spent the last 7 years focusing specifically on the Holocaust in Poland, and that’s really the only explanation which makes sense. The Polish Jews who did flee former-Poland in 1939 went East, not West.
In 1939, the Nazis still thought it would be possible to physically deport Europe's Jews somewhere else. Indeed, Nazi Germany's actions towards German Jews, and then Austrian Jews, etc, were in the interest of ethnic cleansing: making life so unpleasant that the Jews would have no choice but to leave. Unfortunately, there were very few places for the Jews to go, and the number of potential destinations dwindled the closer we get to 1941. It wasn't until the Nazis realized that their Blitzkrieg tactics on the Eastern Front weren't going to immediately win them a huge chunk of land to which they could deport the Jews in their territory, that they turned to a policy of extermination.
The German authorities were hardly nice to huge number of Jews now under their power, but they weren't as direct and hardcore about crushing Jewish political/resistance groups until well into 1942.
Wonderful, thank you. Do you know if that was because Warsaw was in the West, or was there really a perception that the Nazis would be friendlier to the Jews?
