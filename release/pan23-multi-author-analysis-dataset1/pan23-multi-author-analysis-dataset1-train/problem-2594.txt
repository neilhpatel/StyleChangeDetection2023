In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yep. This was also a ballot proposal in Montana that failed back in November. It basically says that if a baby survives an abortion procedure, then the doctors will be forced to deliver it and treat it like any other case of premature birth, or else they will be jailed for five years.
Exactly. A baby whose lungs literally cannot inflate because he or she was born too early, or whose circulatory system cannot function due to a catastrophic and inoperable heart defect, etc etc should not be subjected to extreme medical interventions that cannot save them regardless. Babies who are a little better off but who face an extremely small chance of survival in the short term should be treated according to the parent's wishes, same as any next of kin who is facing down these kinds of terrible decisions. Legislators cannot know the details of each specific case and need to leave the choices up to families with the guidance of medical professionals. These babies are already being treated the same as any other baby.
