Ahhh A question I can answer I spent about two or so years studying the Henrican era, generally focussing on The Reformation. Though it's been a while since I really dug deep into the period, particularly the dissolution of the monasteries, I can certainly give you a good idea of the state of the monasteries throughout the late medieval era and into Henry VIIIs reign. Your second question really delves into the Reformation as a whole and the politics behind the actions of Henry VIII and his government, which is a subject that many Historians have written and argued on for the last 100 years or so. At this point it would be unrealistic to completely break down the reasons for the dissolution and the wider removal of traditional practices from the Church of England, and whether the commissioners, Henry himself, and his council truly believed the monasteries were in such a poor state that they deserved dissolving. For this reason, I'll mainly focus just on the state of the monasteries per your main question, but keep in mind that this was an era of Religious contention in Europe that is almost unrivalled through the last millennium. The Privy Council behind Henry that guided most of his policies was constantly swinging back and forth between strong radical and conservative control, and the dissolution of the monasteries was generally considered a radical move fuelled by Cromwell and his various allies in court.
Thank you for this. I have a follow up regarding Cromwell’s early life. I remember reading somewhere that he had extremely negative experiences in the monasteries in his youth, and that is where his desire to dissolve them was rooted from. I know there isn’t much in regards to his early days, but is there any truth behind that claim, or if you have more detail to his experiences?
