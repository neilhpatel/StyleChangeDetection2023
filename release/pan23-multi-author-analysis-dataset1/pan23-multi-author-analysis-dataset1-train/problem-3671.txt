Oh, yes it can? All the criminals are white, nothing to see here. Bankman fried just blew $30 billion and is playing video games in his parents house in paleo alto, why would any other white guy expect less?

EDIT: if anyone doubts the role that Israeli intelligence operatives play in election interference, A consortium of journalists that investigated the election disinformation operations of Israel included reporters from 30 outlets including Le Monde, Der Spiegel and El Pa√≠s. The focus of the investigation centered on Tal Hanan, a former Israeli special forces operative, who it's claimed to have manipulated more than 30 elections around the world using hacking, sabotage and automated disinformation on social media. He formerly was cooperating with Cambridge Analytica, who managed Trump's social media operations. Amazingly, Robert Mueller didn't investigate Cambridge Analytica - there's not a single mention of them in the official Mueller Report.
Sure they can. We've known this for years and they gave no fucks. Between balloons, bomb trains, UFOs, and the earthquakes, it isn't getting purchase because it's just confirming what we already knew and other shit is developing presently.
