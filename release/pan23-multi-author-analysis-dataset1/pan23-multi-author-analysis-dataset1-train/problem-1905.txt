Pick combo of DeSantis and Donald as vice president (lol no way his ego could take that hit) and lose elections the moment authorities come to Mar a Shitgo to pick up Trump.
Oh and there is a beautiful option number 4: Trump starts his own party and fucks with Republicans on multiple elections. White House, House, Senate... The best thing about cults is this - even if Donnie boi ends up behind bars Ivanka or Eric or coked out Junior could take over and still fuck Republican party for many many decades to come. Remember they are all broke their only source of income is politics. You think Junior will get a job at Wallmart after daddy ends up in jail - fuck no, he'll take over the cult and milk the craziest of crazy among Republicans.
Serious. I can just see him coming up with some new rule as: “you can’t arrest and lockup a presidential candidate” and then getting in front of the “right” judge.
