This is NOT the start of WW3, folks. Calm. However, Poland has a lot of options to make things incredibly unpleasant for Russia without kicking off WW3 if it's confirmed Russia was the source of the missile.
Initial findings suggest that the missile that hit Poland was fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile, Associated Press reported on Wednesday, citing U.S. officials.
1. Say “oh yeah we get it’s an accident.” Doesn’t mesh with my understanding of polish outlook. So the next two:
Another approach is, if the targeting computers on russian missiles are so shit that Poland cannot be assured they won’t hit its national territory, it should agree a bilateral treaty with Ukraine that Poland will destroy any russian missiles that come within range of their air defences regardless of whether they are overflying Ukrainian territory at the time. Then appeal to all NATO members to supply air defences to Poland. Essentially create a no fly zone over a large part of Ukraine.
There are intermediary options. For example shooting down all missiles within X kilometers of NATO borders to prevent such “accidents” from happening again. Would serve to annoy Russia significantly without outright war.
