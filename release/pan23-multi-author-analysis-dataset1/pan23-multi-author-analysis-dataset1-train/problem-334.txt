It’s infuriating. Do they honestly think that once DeSantis burns down all the libraries and is receiving daily reports on every teen girl’s menstrual periods, that he’s not eventually coming after their guns? It’s insane to me how republicans pushing hard for an authoritarian shift, seemingly aware that authoritarians, once in power have no sides and no loyalties because they don’t need them. The Prince ought to be required reading for every republican. The alliances dictators build to get into power often become liabilities once they’re in power. The people (your own kingmakers) that enable your ascent to power are the exact people who have proven their ability to enable your replacement’s ascent, and must therefor be tightly controlled. How do they not know this?

Exactly. Right wingers all think they're going to be the ones tossing people out of windows for stupid reasons, not the ones getting tossed when their masters run out of easily accessible enemies and manufacture new ones to keep machine fed.
It's there in broad daylight. McConnel getting deals with Russian companies. Trump's countless ties. Rorbacher, Gaetz, desantis, Abbott, MTG, just follow the money.
