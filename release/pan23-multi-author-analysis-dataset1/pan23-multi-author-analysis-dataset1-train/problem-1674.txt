The WTO only cares about a territory exerting autonomy over trade - it doesn't give a shit about political repression, democracy, or human rights.
Yes there is. You need to have independent sovereignty to be a member of the WTO. Hong Kong used to be sovereign, and now they are not. I never said they needed to be a democracy, but China destroying their democracy proves that HK is not independent and therefore they deserve zero recognition under the WTO.

Irrelevant. The US does not need to wait for China to blow up HK's trade rules, just like China didn't need to wait until 2050 to blow up HK's democracy even though they agreed to.
