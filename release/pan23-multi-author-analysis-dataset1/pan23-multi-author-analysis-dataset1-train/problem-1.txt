I'm not arguing with you here, I'm simply trying to contextualize this for you. To the extent that they are there, it is with your consent. The state has passed laws making sure that vulnerable people (not saying he's one) don't get abused (not saying you're abusing him), and in casting a wide net to save as many vulnerable little birds as possible from hitting the floor after being kicked out of their nest wrongfully, the state has (as much from a lack of better options as from any other reason) created a circumstance where occasionally some not-so-vulnerable little bird can take advantage of someone else's nest.
He's at my place half the time and his fiance(e)'s place the other half of the time. He's been (homeless) couch surfing for several years and only recently got engaged to his other partner. We don't have any current issues that would lead me to want this arrangement to stop, but I do want to protect my own legal rights.
I don't think he, in particular, would do that, but I do want to retain my own legal rights wherever possible/appropriate.
