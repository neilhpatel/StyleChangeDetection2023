At first I was ready to dive in on also being Part 107 licensed, former attorney, photos taken from public place aren't trespassing, yada yada yada but at the end of the day, I'd rather be done with the neighbor and sell my client's home without (any?) issue than be "right.".
Legally they may not have much of a standing considering taking photos of the outside of the house isn't usually considered a violation of privacy unless they've taken extra steps to ensure privacy (building a high fence, planting high hedges, etc.), but they sound like they're the type to cause issues, which could slow down the sale of the property. I feel bad for whoever moves in to that house smh. The best advice I could give as someone who works in real estate (although I'm probably still a baby in comparison) is to do your best to calm the neighbors while still doing whatever possible to give your client the best experience. At the end of the day you hold a contract with the seller, not the neighborhood. Do what's in their best interest.
