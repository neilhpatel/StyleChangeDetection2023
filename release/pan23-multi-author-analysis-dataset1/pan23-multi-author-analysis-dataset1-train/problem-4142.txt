I don't know all the ins and outs of the system and all the bureaucratic bullshit that goes on. I'll be the first to admit it. But, this is year 8 and I still haven't perfected my teaching materials.

But some stuff doesn't line up and they don't provide enough sample problems. In my opinion, I'm better off creating my own materials. I don't know if there's something I'm missing behind the scenes, but from my personal experience in the classroom these kids are lacking in some critical thinking skills, not all but a good portion.
