If businesses are allowed to discriminate based on their religion, then they should be required to post it ahead of time so the rest of us will know where not to spend our money. I am in favor of this approach.
Priests officiate religious wedding ceremonies, but don't hold any civil authority. That's why you need a marriage license. That's why Catholics can get divorced in the United States. The church will consider them married under church law, and will refuse to marry them to another person, which is fine because they're holding a religious ceremony. But a divorced catholic can still get remarried in other churches that recognize their divorce. Could you imagine a family court judge refusing to allow couples to divorce because the judge happens to be catholic and divorce violates their personal religious beliefs?
I like this! Because it finally makes it legal to discriminate against religious “messages” since it’s not about “who”, but “what”, as Gorsuch puts it. Like, a business would not be discriminatory if denying service to Jews or Catholics themselves, it’d just be denying the “message”. Let hilarity ensue 🫡.
