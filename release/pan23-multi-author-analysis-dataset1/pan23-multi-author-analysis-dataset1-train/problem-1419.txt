The sales rep is just trying to protect their commission because if the dealership has to fix it it will reduce the gross profit which he is getting paid from so I would call and ask to speak to the sales manager or the new car director of the dealership and if they won’t help contact the general manager or the managing partner/owner. The deal was negotiated assuming the vehicle was new and unblemished and I’m sure the price reflected that unblemished state so just keep going up the chain and eventually the dealership should fix that dent and if not you can contact corporate/the manufacturer and they may lean on the dealer to fix it but you may not get much traction there so your best bet is to handle it with management at the dealership.
That’s good, if possible you should push for a paintless dent repair that can be kept off the Carfax because there’s a chance if it has to go to a regular body shop to be fixed that it might end up on the Carfax and diminish the value of the vehicle and if that’s the case I would either demand the deal be unwound and go elsewhere or demand they reduce the price to compensate or the loss of value.
I would take the photo to the sales rep and call BS. He should take care of it from a business stance. If they say no. This would be difficult but you can potentially try to void the sale saying you were expecting a new car without damage and misled into this car. I doubt it will work but possible. It may be you just have to eat it and they lose a customer.
