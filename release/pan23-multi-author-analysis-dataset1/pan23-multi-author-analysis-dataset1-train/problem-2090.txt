Not necessarily. Bitcoin is not the only crypto currency out their and has long been beaten in terms of anonymity. Pretty early on people identified the public ledger of transactions as a huge flaw, and in the past couple years it's become pretty well known that people can trace it with enough resources. If they converted that shit into Monero then it would actually be untraceable, and if random drug dealers can figure that out, for all of the obvious incompetence surrounding Trump, I'd think they'd be able to figure that part out.
