Outright traitor. Send him to the front lines on the Russian side. They are so desperate they accept anybody. He might even find a boyfriend among the murderers that Wagner hired.
It's about only administration-controlled parties , making it absolutely impossible for people who are not government-controlled puppets to register a political party or movement.
Eh. Russians are never going to change. They have been this way for millennia, why would they change now? Lying and taking what isn't theirs is just a part of their beautiful culture.
Putin must be retired (to prevent such "accidents" from happening again), there must be discussions to determine a reparations payment plan (which is realistic, to allow Russia to rebuild its economy), there should be a lease arrangement for Crimea (because Russia needs access to waterways and the money will help Ukraine rebuild), Ukrainians taken against their will by Russian military must be returned, there should be a DMZ from their mutual border to some distance within Russia. When those are arranged, there can be consideration for Russia rejoining the international economic system and for plans to rebuild Ukraine.
