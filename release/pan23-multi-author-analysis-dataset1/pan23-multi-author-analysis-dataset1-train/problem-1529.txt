In 1903, at the behest of the "Mexican citizenry," Porfirio Díaz created a commission to investigate the impact of Chinese settlers on Mexico. In 1911, the commission produced a report which concluded that the Chinese were “undesirables” because they took the place of more "desirable" ethnic groups like white Europeans. Ironically, Díaz's administration benefited the most from Chinese settlers, as they were often used as cheap laborers (just like in the United States) for government-funded economic programs (e.g. El Boleo Copper Mine), and the Chinese's service to the Mexican dictator also contributed to the intense hatred Mexicans had for them.

The Chinese who settled in Mexico (particularly those in urban centers like Mexico City) were relatively successful, as they owned many small businesses like grocery stores. However, Mexicans believed that these newcomers benefited at the expense of their own businesses, so they began to harbor anti-Chinese sentiments. They would accuse the Chinese of forming monopolies, stealing jobs, and lusting after Mexican women.
