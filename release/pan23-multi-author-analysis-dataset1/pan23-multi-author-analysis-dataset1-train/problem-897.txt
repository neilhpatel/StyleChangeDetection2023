It is also worth noting that the California Privacy Rights Act, passed in late 2020, modifies the timeline for protection standards granted to data derived from employees in a business setting in California. Think of CPRA as sort of a publicly-voted amendment to the protections initially granted in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
Now, organizations in CA are allowed to push back their privacy compliance for employee-derived data back to 2023. Generously speaking, this is likely to accommodate necessary changes in IT architecture and systems as employers gear up for more robust data privacy compliance in accordance with CCPA. But in reality, it leaves sort of a functional blind spot in data protection law, since protections for employee-generated or derived data are sort of stranded in an ambiguous grey zone until 2023.
Is this room lockable? Are you the key holder for that room? Is the space used for other business purposes?
> California makes it a crime to record or eavesdrop on any confidential communication, including a private conversation or telephone call, without the consent of all parties to the conversation. See Cal. Penal Code ยง 632. A California appellate court has ruled that this statute applies to the use of hidden video cameras to record conversations as well. See California v. Gibbons, 215 Cal. App. 3d 1204 (Cal Ct. App. 1989).
Because of the lack of privacy in public i would assume so that it is legal, but if it's that big of a deal you can talk to an attorney or a law firm that is good with work place environments.
That seems legal because you wouldn't expect any decent privacy in the area, and workplaces do have the right to install cameras in areas that not like the bathroom where you would expect privacy.
