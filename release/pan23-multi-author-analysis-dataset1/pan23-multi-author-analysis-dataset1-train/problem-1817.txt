Without marriage, legally separating intertwined interests is still possible, but is just not as straightforward. Divorce provides a legal framework for determining, distributing, and enforcing the equitable allocation of shared assets and liabilities. When people think about marriage, they tend to focus on the benefits it conveys during the best of times- when it is formed and while the couple remains married. Some of its strongest and most important protections only come into effect during the worst of times- with incapacitation by severe illness or injury, the death of one or both individuals, or through the active choice to end the relationship via divorce.
There isn't enough info here to go by. If they are not divorced but separated and in the process of divorce then his lawyer might have told him to go live on the property otherwise it may be seen as abandonment.
If they are divorced and he no longer has rights to the property call the police and report a trespasser. They will take him away in a police car.
Exactly. He was ordered off of the deed. Being on the mortgage does not grant right of domicile, only obligation of payment against the lien on title. He is abusing his position and is in contempt of judicial order as it is reported to us by OP.
