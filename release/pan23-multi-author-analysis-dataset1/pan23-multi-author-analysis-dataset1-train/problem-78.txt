"We have disposed of all the ballots we'll be able to dispose of during this cycle. So it is now safe to vote. Just a reminder for our constituents, please do not write-in "Jesus" in the field provided. Select the printed Republican candidate.".
PHOENIX — For years, the chair of Arizona’s Republican Party has led attacks on this swing state’s early voting system, warning without evidence that mail-in voting and ballot drop boxes are insecure and unreliable.
In Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and more than half of the state’s voters, Republicans were well behind their pace of early ballot returns from four years ago, according to an analysis of voter data by The Washinon Post. As of Thursday, 330,000 ballots had been received from Republicans, compared with 391,000 at an equivalent point in 2018. The return rate for the GOP had dropped from 63 percent of ballots requested to just 49 percent.
Among Democrats, meanwhile, the rate of requested ballots that were returned had also fallen compared to 2018, from 56 percent to 51 percent. But the absolute number received in the fast growing and diversifying county was up, from 298,000 to 330,000.\\.
