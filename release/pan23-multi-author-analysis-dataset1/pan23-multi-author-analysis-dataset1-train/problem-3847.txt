Do not speak to the police without a lawyer at this point. Plan as though you are likely to be arrested, until your lawyer tells you otherwise.
> (b) An individual who in good faith attempts to procure medical assistance for another individual or who accompanies another individual who requires medical assistance for a drug overdose or other perceived medical emergency arising from the use of a controlled substance or a controlled substance analogue that he or she possesses or possessed in an amount sufficient only for personal use and the evidence of his or her violation of this section is obtained as a result of the individual’s attempting to procure medical assistance for another individual or as a result of the individual’s accompanying another individual who requires medical assistance to a health facility or agency.
You need a lawyer. Your phones have been seized as evidence of a crime, and the police have other evidence that also connects you to a crime. Having two phones is not illegal, but having two phones and a bunch of drugs is a great place for a prosecutor to start building a case for possession with intent to distribute, which can put you in jail for a very long time.
