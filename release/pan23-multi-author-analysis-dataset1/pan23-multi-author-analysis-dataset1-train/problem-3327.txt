Thanks for the thoughtful answer! Reading the first post you linked, which mentions that the Italian campaign failed, I’m curious in what respect this is meant. I’m not doubting it, bc obviously I don’t know, but my lay persons understanding was basically that the Allies successfully conquered Italy, and then turned their attention to France. What am I missing?
Further, this question feels like it's founded on the assumption that the 6 June landings at Normandy were a high-risk operation, likely influenced by Saving Private Ryan and every piece of media that's followed in its depictions. Whilst the movie is indeed very good at conveying the experience at Omaha, it cannot be generalised to the other landing beaches, which weren't as bad as Omaha. It was not a bloodbath or a suicide mission, and taking statements like "50% of the first wave to hit Omaha were casualties" in isolation leads to a very skewed picture. The real suicide mission would have been an assault landing at Calais. Normandy was the best option in Northern France. I can provide more previous posts addressing this particular picture, if you'd like.
