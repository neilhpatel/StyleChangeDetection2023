What would that mean in practical terms? In the end we can only really speculate because the Germans didn't put in the effort to document just what they would do and prepare for trials after the war like the Allies and so on, which is what allows us to be more grounded in our assumptions about the reverse scenario for Hitler. But certainly it is clear enough that Hitler believed the Soviet Union was held together in no small part by the will of Stalin - at points in the Table Talk and elsewhere he even is oddly praiseful in ways - and that cutting off the head was the most assured way for the body to collapse.
Thank you so much for your response. I love reading your answers on here so I feel very much honored by your presence in this thread. Keep up the work.
The overall picture is essentially one of the systematic destruction of leadership and moral authority, not dissimilar to the Soviets' own approach to Eastern Poland from 1939-1941 where they set about murdering thousands of members of the Polish political and military elite. Stalin was the top of that tree, the felling of which was a Nazi priority, and while again, verbose planning for Stalin's specific fate might not be easy to find, we nevertheless can contextualize what would likely befall him both within the remarks of Hitler himself, and the broader treatment of Soviet leadership within German hands.
Thank you for that answer! My question is tangential at best, but what does Hitler mean in the first block quote when he references the Russo-Japanese War? It was my understanding that the Russians were basically humiliated by the Japanese during that conflict.
