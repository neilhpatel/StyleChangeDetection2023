I can't even count the number of kids that were arrested for drugs or caught with drugs and alcohol on campus that faced no consequences because their wealthy parents would make massive donations to keep their kids there. One girl a grade ahead of me ended up on bangbus and got expelled but her family wasn't super wealthy. They tried to expel me one month before graduating because a giant red dick got spray painted on a clock tower for the senior prank and they really just wanted to make an example out of someone to put an end to senior pranks (my family also wasn't super wealthy).
Hmm. Am I missing something. If there is no law to cap the prices of private school then…we’re gonna have an issue reminiscent to the cost of college and student loans. Now, not literally the loan part- but They will just make the price of the schools correlate with the voucher. This is going to eat tax money.
