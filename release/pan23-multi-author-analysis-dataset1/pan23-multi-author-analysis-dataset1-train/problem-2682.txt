God, I was having so much anxiety about it. But I kept thinking, I have no reason to think they won't be fine. So thank you for this information. I feel much better now!
Just to add a bit, make sure you have an easily accessible list of emergency contacts for your kids to use, make sure you go over escape plans (fire, etc), make sure you have medicine dosage lists, (like tylenol or others if they take meds), if you are friendly with your neighbors, give them a heads up in case the kids need to go there in an emergency, make pre-made snacks/meals that both kids can easily access/make, it is totally ok to be overly safe when your kids are involved.
This is only the legal side of things. Nobody can predict what your ex will do, but you are not legally required to inform her of this short time with the kids at home alone, unless it is addressed in your custody order or divorce decree. I see absolutely no issue with you leaving them at home for three hours once a month, provided the older son is responsible and they both know who to call if there's any problem.
