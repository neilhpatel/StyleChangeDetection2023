that's probably your impression as a citizen, there might be no visible effects in your daily life (yet), but that's because your dear leader is doing everything he can to mask that the country is declining more than in the last 30 years. I suppose that you're from one of the large cities and not from bled out more remote regions that you hear nothing about. have you asked your compatriots from rural or remote areas _directly_ when was the last time they received their pensions? or what they can buy from the little hush money they get? You see, a country can always print more of their own currency, the question is what you people can buy with it from abroad; they still have enough bread from stolen Ukrainian grain, so they keep quiet, since they're used to austerity and they don't have a voice that could be heard in the cities anyway, since it's being efficiently suppressed like since forever...
Exactly. I agree with all your points. So the real solution wouldâ€™ve been a harsher treaty with full enforcement to the terms. To ensure it cannot take up arms again or to be used as nazi propaganda.
