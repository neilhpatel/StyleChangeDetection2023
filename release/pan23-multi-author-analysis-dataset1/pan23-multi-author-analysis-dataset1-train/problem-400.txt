Welcome to the “Forbidden to Remember, Terrified to Forget: Trauma, Truth, and Narratives of Indigenous History” conference panel Q&A! Settler societies around the world rest on foundations of violence perpetrated against the original inhabitants of the land. While open conflict has become less common over time, the resulting traumas have been perpetuated by brutal processes of forced assimilation. Even as these societies take unsteady steps towards acknowledging and attempting to reconcile this past, the reality of these histories and their incompatibility with heroic national narratives is a source of inescapable tension. This panel explores these tensions, seeking to carve out space to acknowledge the traumas suffered by Indigenous peoples amidst wider processes of local and national mythmaking.
Moderated by Kyle Pittman (u/Snapshot52), the papers in this panel all deal with various forms of Indigenous trauma, from residential schools to the memorializing of Indigenous death at the hands of settler colonizers.
I'm always a big fan of free and open access. Very interesting to see what an important role it played. (Something I can point out to several people in my life I discuss this with frequently!).

Thank you to all the panelist for your work. Here in Canada the Residential Schools have been a very important topic of discussion, so this is very timely in many ways.
