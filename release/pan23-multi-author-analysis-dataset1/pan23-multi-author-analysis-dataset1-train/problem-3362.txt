“The rule of law is undermined by the toxic combination of political fundraising with legal fees paid by political action committees, reckless and factually untrue statements by lawyers at rallies and in the media, and efforts to advance a political narrative through lawsuits without factual basis or any cognizable legal theory,” Middlebrooks wrote in his Nov. 10 ruling. “Lawyers are enabling this behavior and I am pessimistic that Rule 11 alone can effectively stem this abuse.

No shit. She shared some dumbass on her Facebook claiming “They didn’t let me vote! I arrived at 7 and even though there were a ton of people in line they told me no you can’t vote go home”.
