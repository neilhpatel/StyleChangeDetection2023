The vast majority of the Roman population didn't live in the sprawling villas or even comfortable doma of popular conception. In most cities, the bulk of the poor population were crammed into insula; the tower blocks of their time. These were famous for, essentially, being slums: overcrowded, cheaply built and badly maintained, unhygienic, and very prone to catching fire. By comparison, the rural dwelling of the Early Medieval English peasant was quite spacious: the excavation of sites like Mucking, Essex suggest that the average Early Medieval house had roughly the same footprint as a modern average British family home.
Wow that is one hell of a reply! Thank you very much for all the suggestions I will dig in over the next weeks in my reading time. The more I hear about it the more I know that I know absolutely nothing ðŸ˜‚.
The Church and its teachings (no sarcasm required) was just about the sole entity responsible for preserving literacy, learning, history, and science throughout the periods of civil war, recession, plagues, invasions and population collapse which marked Late Antiquity and its transition into the Early Medieval. Throughout the Medieval period, the Church was the driving force behind European science and discovery.
