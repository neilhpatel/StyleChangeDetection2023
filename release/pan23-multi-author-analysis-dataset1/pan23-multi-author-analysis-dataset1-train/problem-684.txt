The more I looked into this, the more I became certain that there is an entire book to be written just on the history of alcohol and alcohol regulations in Russia — and there actually has been! . However, Schrad is a political scientist, and even if it were a history, it would be inadmissible as an answer on its own because of the rule against presenting sources or quotations without analysis, so I'll just throw the link out there and in the meantime get on with my answer.
Could they not just tax beer? Perhaps I missed something. Seems like they could have just taxed all alcohol equally to the same effect. Is it something do with home brewing of beer being easy?
This is probably a strange parallel to note, but I'm almost reminded of the Chernobyl accident 125 years later — a poorly-informed attempt to deflate a moderately worrying problem suddenly explodes into a terrible public health crisis much, much worse than the original issue. The rest of the parallel is not at all accurate, of course, but I had fun thinking of it.
