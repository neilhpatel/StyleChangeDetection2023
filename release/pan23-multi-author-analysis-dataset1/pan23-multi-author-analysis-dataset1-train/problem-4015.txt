In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
2. The current temporary block is not a ruling on the merits of the case which is what you're talking about when you get to the authority argument. We don't know the outcome of the case yet, but even if SCOTUS does block it on merit, that doesn't mean they could block the pause too. Blocking the forgiveness would be a huge stretch already. Blocking the pause would be a giant leap, especially considering that the pause has been ongoing for years.

That forgiveness removed legal jurisdiction for the government to go after larger businesses that did not shutdown, but still got PPP loans.
