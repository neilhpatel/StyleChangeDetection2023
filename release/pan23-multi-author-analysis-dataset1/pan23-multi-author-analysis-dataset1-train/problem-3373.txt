The state is so hopelessly locked into the American concept of capitalism that anything actually progressive is basically a no go. And they will abandon any progressive principles if it suits their economic interests. All those people moving from California to Texas that so many have hope for turning the state purple... you mean the people that moved from one of the most progressive states to one of the least so they can lower their tax burden? Yeah, they're not coming to save you and will gladly vote for a Republican if the Democrat is too progressive. Beto is milquetoast and as such, acceptable.

Exactly. There needs to be a candidate in every single election, because you aren't going to win anything if you don't have a candidate. Things happen to candidates and you need to have a (D) on the ballot.
