In terms of naval reach and empire, the chief rival of Athens for most of the fifth century BC was Corinth, the old mercantile state that challenged Athenian power both in the Ionian and the Aegean Sea. The first great wars of this century were effectively fought between Athens and Corinth for naval supremacy, even if Sparta was nominally involved as the hegemon to which Corinth was a subservient ally. Corinth had been great in the Late Archaic period, but in the fifth and fourth centuries BC it became overstretched and exhausted from constant wars. Its lacklustre track record in the First Peloponnesian War and the Archidamian War were signs of its decline, and its key strategic role in the devastating Corinthian War (395-386 BC) sealed the deal; Corinth was unable to keep up with Athens at sea or with Sparta on land, and ended the period as a second-rate power.
That surprises me. They had lots of land and slaves to farm it, but I got the sense that most of the citizens were not involved in trade or crafts. Where did this wealth come from (aside from injections of cash from Persia, etc)?
