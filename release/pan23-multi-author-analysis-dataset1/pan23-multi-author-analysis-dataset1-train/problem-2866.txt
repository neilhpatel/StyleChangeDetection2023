I was teaching English in Beijing in January of 2020 when this all got started and I sort of got stuck there. I just left the country for the first time since 2020 last week due to a combination of a death in the family back home and my contract in China expiring this month giving me a convenient push to get out, back in the US for now. The most amazing thing about China's reversals of their COVID restrictions is how sudden they were. I remember staying up all night in early December because there were rumors going around on WeChat that a full nationwide lockdown with martial law was coming, then 6 hours later they announced that testing would no longer be mandatory, restaurants could re-open, and and we didn't need to show a health code to take public transportation.
I still haven't gotten it. We just need to categorize those who have gotten it legally differently from those who have. That way we can give more rights to those that do the right thing.
