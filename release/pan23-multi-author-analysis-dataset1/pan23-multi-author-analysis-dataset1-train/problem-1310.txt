I'm not saying OP's dad doesn't have a case, but I think it would be unwise for anyone reading this thread to go away under the impression that offering severance along with a non-disparagement agreement is somehow unusual and indicative of likely liability.
1. 8 weeks severance after 20 years is insulting, but not illegal. It’s more than they have to do. At-will employment sucks. Its possible to negotiate for other things besides money here. Like a letter of recommendation (should have been offered after 20 years) and an nda preventing that law group from disclosing the reason for termination to future employees. You’d actually want the language to read something like “only allowed to verify employment dates.” This well at least contain the situation and help with a new job. Also ask for his employee file with all his reviews.
Usually consultations with employment attorneys are free. He may not have a case but it’s not a bad idea to talk to a plaintiff’s side employment attorney to suss it out.
