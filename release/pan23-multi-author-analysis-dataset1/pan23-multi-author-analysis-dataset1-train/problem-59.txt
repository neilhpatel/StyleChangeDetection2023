OP - Is the entire bridle path on your property, and was hers fenced to the edge of her property previously? Or was it shared/the property line is somewhere in the middle? Presumably if she’s using your fence line as the “back” walls of her paddock then she must have extended the “side” walls up to your fence, and therefore onto your property? If that’s the case then you can and should have those removed (I’d consult a lawyer about this for how to do it properly in your area). If she hasn’t built on your property and her horses are just “loose” and grazing on your unenclosed property - she generally can’t be forced to build a fence but you could install a second fence line just inside your property line to delineate it (expensive, but it wouldn’t have to be livestock grade because it’s not meant for containing animals) or look into local/state ordinance that might legally require her to keep her livestock contained on her property.
She is likely to ignore a letter from you and you will have lost some time. Also inspect the far side of your fence and document any damage.
