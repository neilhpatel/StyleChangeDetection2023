There was one, I'm trying to find the article. But it was in Texas or South Carolina and they were reenacting a battle at the end of the war where the armies found out the war ended before the battle started. Some civil war reenactor had a heart attack running across the field. It was in a Dave Barry column a few years ago.
NATO aside, It's also tactically impossible. Those straits are long, narrow bottlenecks within easy firing range from shore. Anything that tries to pass without permission would become an exposed shooting gallery target for what I would assume would be massive amounts of consolidated ordinance. I don't think even the U.S. Navy could make it without air support, and the tugboat runway doesn't count.
Oh absolutely. Of course that fleet was a fleet in name only. Russia released a military report of the inspection of the Moskva a few months before it sunk. It was embarassing even by Russian standards. The fleet HAD potential to be a real threat to NATO carrier groups. It's purpose was, and still is, to take on NATO seaborne forces.
Seriously. Degrading your naval fleet in a land war is on par with losing the emu war to the emus or civil war reenactors suffering more casualties at the reenactment than the actual battle.
