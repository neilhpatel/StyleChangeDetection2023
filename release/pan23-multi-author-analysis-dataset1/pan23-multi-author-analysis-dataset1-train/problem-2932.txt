>	The missile buy would boost Japan’s long-range strike capability and mark a stunning break with a long tradition of eschewing offensive weapons. And it would enhance Japan’s conventional deterrent as China undertakes a sweeping military modernization and North Korea barrels ahead with its nuclear program.
. Commodore Arkhipov was the deciding vote to "retaliate" against allegedly launched Nuclear Missles. For all intents and purposes, he believed that nukes were being launched, and rather than retaliating, he accepted the notion and never fired his own nukes. I hope we never put this theory to the test, but I can only hope that if war breaks and total war re-enters the battlefield, those who press the button will not follow the orders of those who command it, for no matter the risk, the cost of launching/retaliating is that of humanity's future.
I would say since the 80's. Now they have more offensive capabilities but JSDF were still one of the most modern and powerful militaries in the 80's thanks to their economic boom (at the time) and the USSR as neighbour.
