The third book was a bit more delayed (Tolkien was working on supplemental material) and only came in October 1955, which gave a larger window to speculation. However, the closest I've found to what you want is someone not wondering about plot, but lore. Rather delightfully, a reader (Richard Jeffery, September 1955) asked Tolkien himself about Elvish.
where Tolkien replied "...your command of Elvish script (not Runes) is quite good enough to read." In the same letter, in response to a question about naming, he wrote:
Organized science fiction/fantasy fandom predates The Lord of the Rings in paperback, and there is some evidence in established fanzines of the period that people were reading and commenting on LOTR as they were coming out in the 50s, but everything's going by mail and the focus is still mostly on the contracting pulp fiction market, so it takes a little time to disseminate. I did a brief trawl through FANAC's in the 1950s, but it definitely seems like The Lord of the Rings largely made a quiet splash in organized fandom in the year it appeared; but it did receive some reasonable coverage in more mainstream newspapers, like Edwin Muir's and Laycock's , but these both lack the real "fannish" approach.
