The same thing is happening with China & the CCP right now. A lot of us have seen the way they are operating and spoken out about their plethora of issues, namely: The human rights abuses, threatening their neighbors, wanton destruction of wildlife (including multiple endangered species for "medicine"), pollution on a scale never before seen on earth, dystopian mass surveillance of the population (including establishing hidden police stations in other nations to track and deal with Chinese people abroad), the genocide of their minority peoples (Tibetan, Uyghur, anyone non-Han Chinese), organ harvesting (which was confirmed by international investigations), corporate espionage, blatant stealing of Intellectual Property, and a myriad of other issues that seem to be getting ignored on the world stage. For years if you spoke poorly of the CCP you were chastised as racist, crazy, or paranoid even though the evidence is out in the open. Still today, the trolls crawl out of the woodwork with whataboutisms, and work in tandem to downplay or outright censor those who bring up these issues.
What escalation? We were already sending MBTs to Ukraine, Poland alone send more than 260 T72s, and there are few other countries that gave them tanks.
