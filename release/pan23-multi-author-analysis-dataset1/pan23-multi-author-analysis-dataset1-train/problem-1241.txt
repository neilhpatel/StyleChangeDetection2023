The people got tired of the previous regime, protested, and made the president quit. A new president was appointed and currently he's running the country until the next elections are held.
Exactly. If you asked Sri Lankans 99 of the things they would want to improve about the country, this would still not come up.
Literally watching, no. But in a way they're watching your shit in aggregate, as some larger Canadian cities are analyzing wastewater for traces of COVID and other diseases like flu to get a sense of how they're trending. It's still new-ish science and fluctuating factors can inflate or understate the true level of infections in the community, but with the provincial governments severely limiting official COVID testing, wastewater analysis is all we have now, and unlike hospitalizations it's a leading indicator since COVID turns up in waste even if you're not symptomatic.
Good. Nobody should be discriminated for their way of living just as long as they're not hurting themselves or others. It's 2023 folks, it's well past time we start minding our own business.
In case of religion, main monotheistic religions such as Christianity/Catholicism and Islam directly forbid homosexuality and call it a sin. And pretty much most of the opposition to homosexuality in the Western and Islamic worlds stem from this.
On the other hand, there are other countries where main religions don't necessarily forbid it, but are looked down upon due to cultural reasons. Some of that is bred during the British colonial occupation in those countries, as the Brits back in the day were pretty anti-gay. And even without British intervention, since heterosexuality is the 'default setting' if you will, a lot of cultures may perceive it as unusual and may not regard it being worthy of same regards as heterosexuality.
