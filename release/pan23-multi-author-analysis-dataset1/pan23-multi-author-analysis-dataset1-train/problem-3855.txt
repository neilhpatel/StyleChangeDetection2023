But you make a good point about how the cult has sacrificed A LOT for this single man. He is literally a messiah to some, and that’ll be hard to overcome with reason. Plus, if him and Desantis do have a genuine rivalry, there’s a good chance Trump sees the all powerful presidential position he’s been setting up for years as being his best ticket to getting rid of the multitude of court cases against him.
This whole thing is a mess. It’s going to be more of 2016 and the brutal four years of Trump that we had to endure. The TV news networks and the newspapers are rubbing their hands together with glee. The ad buys will be epic.
Trump proved that Republicans don't need to speak in plausibly deniable euphemisms like "states rights," "national security," and "family values". Trump won his first primary by doing the euphemisms and going straight for the throat with "Mexican rapists," "Muslim registries," and "liberal media is the enemy of the people.".
Plus Trump's VP and Trump's Ambassador to the United Nations coming together to endorse someone other than Trump (even as they don't badmouth Trump while doing it) is significant in a way that outweighs their individual support.
I guess. But in the US, the Trump signs are often in front of a shack or run down house. Do you think those people know who Nikki Haley is? Or have any affinity for Pence? Trump told everyone Pence is disloyal.
