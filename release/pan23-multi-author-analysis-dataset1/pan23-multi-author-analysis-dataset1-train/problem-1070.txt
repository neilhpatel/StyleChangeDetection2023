Generally you can't appeal a plea bargain unless you can prove your counsel was ineffective. In the legal sense proving ineffective counsel is a high bar, basically you need to prove that they did an unreasonably bad job, and if you had adequate counsel the result would have been different. With getting a suspended sentence, charges reduced from intent to distribute it is hard to argue that they did a bad job. Showing up late and getting continuances aren't really an issue legally(presumably you were not in jail during this time).

Just wondering. And do you think my lawyer might have believe it was a typical case where I was caught red handed no way to get around and, or potentially didn't want to come back to court to do trail process I had paid him 850 when I hired him and he was to get my 800 dollar bond as rest of payment. Meaning if he closed the case he got his money.
