Thanks for your reply. What they explained makes sense, I just know I’m conflicted. Since the judgment amount is so small, I didn’t think it would be worth an attorney. I went through the pain of small claims and filed the lien mostly out of principal. I couldn’t let my old landlord just walk away.
The final option is to find an escrow company (used by people who sell and buy) they could take your release and be at the closing where they will only give the release to the title company when they get your $ 1,000 AND AND AND the Seller estate can/will pay for ALLL the costs of the escrow services. OR hire an attorney who will represent you at closing and hand them the release when you get the $ 1,000 AND AND AND the Seller will pay for YOUR attorney's legal fees.
c. you will send the the release, but the risk is that if you don't send the release after you get paid, the title company will take the $ 1,000 in escrow (or more) and pay the judgement to the court and file a suit to quiet title etc.
