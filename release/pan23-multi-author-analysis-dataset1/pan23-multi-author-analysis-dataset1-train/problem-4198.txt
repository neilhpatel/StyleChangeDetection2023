Generally, we don't know the intended target. The White House or Capitol Building are the most likely, but not conclusive. Per Tyler Drumhiller, head of CIA operations in Europe.
WTC1 and 7 were very close to each other and when 1 fell a good amount of debris fell onto 7 and ignited a large fire burning the core of 7 not long after WTC2 fell and the streets were covered FDNY was unable to get any working engine in a timely manner to accommodate for the blaze going on in 7, which led to its collapse.
L.A. is like the youngest, flashy sibling. Super popular. Kind of fake, but loads of fun. The one who parties and sets the trend.
I have another question concerning a claim I've heard repeatedly in Europe and wondered as to its content: this claim goes that the name "Al Qa'ida" was brought up during the trial on the first world trade center bombing (1992) the first time, and that the FBI -- not the network itself -- essentially came up with the name to give it a label for public discussion; in other words, the story is that al Qaeda didn't even really name itself until after it was called that way publicly by the FBI. This always sounded a bit odd to me.
