That Jetstar incident (not JetBlue) actually demonstrates the opposite -- that it's very hard to land with substantially the wrong flaps in a modern airliner.
Haha yes. Having nostalgia at moment. I actually watched that cave rescue film on Disney other day. I same. Never getting into a cave with any water near by again haha.
People frequently have a personal crisis about purpose or meaning, which is probably related to how we think of morality as constrictive and authoritarian and akin to laws. I think we need to recognise moral ideas as a component of fun, as well, and present in base motivations, and in immoral acts, and aesthetic opinions, and aspirations, and everywhere.
Wow. Have you ever been on a plane? Everyone on that plane would have known exactly what was happening, the plane was nosedived into the ocean. As a passenger I feel like "we're all gonna die" landing at LaGuardia or San Diego.
Inductivism also continues bubbling under. People think you can predict the future with statistics.
