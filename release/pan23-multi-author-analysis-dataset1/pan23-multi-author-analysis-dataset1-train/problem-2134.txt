It does get better when you put distance between you and them. If you can afford a therapist, this is how to find a good one. Call three and ask for a free half hour by phone. Sum up your problem in 5 minutes and give them 25 minutes to talk and ask questions. You will know who knows their stuff.

If you’ve escalated this through the police chain of command and attempted to push it with the local DA’s office and they are failing to act to protect you it may be time to get your own counsel (separate of any counsel for the divorce).

It may even be worthwhile to contact one of the larger LGBTQ+ legal non-profits like Lambda Legal to see if they can direct you to resources.
