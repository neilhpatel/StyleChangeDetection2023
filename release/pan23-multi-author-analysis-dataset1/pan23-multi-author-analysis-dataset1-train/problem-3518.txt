A number of riots and revolts took place, and enclosure was one of the causes of the English Civil War: the landowners of Parliament supported enclosure because it enriched them, while the King opposed it because it strenhened Parliament. Politically, it also contributed to the rise of "rotten" boroughs that became a major topic of Parliamentary reform in the 19th century.
