For some one not brought up in Mob Controlled NY/NJ/RI Real Estate Markets, you might be right. But, Trump was! Working for an Elevator Company, as a Repairman, I saw many buildings housing parts of the Controlling Mobs. I had many conversations with the Minor Bosses. As a "Working Man", I was OK. Massachusetts also had segments of these Mobs. Starting in the eighties, most went Legit. At least in public. Owning and selling Property made money for them. And, was good to Launder Money. Some even took to Politics.
I watched this thug on live tv on Jan 6, and kept thinking, "if this particular guy doesn't end up getting shot, I'll be amazed"- he was pushy, brash, and continually in the face of a couple different Capital Police officers, including the hero black officer, sorry I don't remember his name right now (Goodman, maybe?). This asshole needs to go away for a very very long time.
