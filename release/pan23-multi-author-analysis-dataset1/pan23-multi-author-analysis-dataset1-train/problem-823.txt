i'm a little confused on why she didn't have her insurance company deal with it... that's ultimately what she pays them to do, but that's hindsight.
if it's no fault, that doesn't mean the parties can't still try to make a claim... my guess would be the other party made a claim to their insurance that totaled 19k and their insurance through subrogation went after your GF. they served your GF but she mistakenly thought it was part of the proceedings taking place with the state. the damage might have only appeared as a small ding, but that doesn't mean it didn't cause further damage underneath. there also could have been medical bills. it is not uncommon for someone to feel fine when they get in an accident and not notice until hours or even a day later that they were injured after the adrenaline wears off. 19k is not an obscene amount of loss to come to in a car accident.
That apparently didn't happen. Probably because GF was excluded from coverage or car owner didn't have insurance either.
