I mean to be honest she didn't hide herself when she put the bomb there. You can see it from the security cameras. It's obvious who the perpetrator is. They found her in a neighborhood named Kanarya with lots of gold and money and one pistol(as far as i know) but i think Erdogan would want something like this. Because last week they had a talk with HDP( a political party which is highly suspected to have ties with PKK) and a week later this happened. So close to elections aswell.
They're blaming Kurds for this, and with no evidence beyond the government’s quickly prepared narrative—one very convenient for pre-election goals like attacking North and East Syria or banning HDP—and reporting bans and internet shutdowns instituted to keep things that way, this is simply not credible. Heavy skepticism warranted. To this day, the circumstances of similar deadly attacks on civilians that preceded the November 2015 elections, like the bombings in Suruç and Ankara, have not been investigated in detail. Those who ask for justice and accountability have been prosecuted and censored instead.
