They might not be able to prevent it, that's the thing. Ukraine doesn't really have much choice but to try to take Nova Kakhovka first from across the river. They can't risk losing their army to flooding in Kherson.

i would say a lot of them are not so professional, going by all the videos on r/combatfootage they seemed to commit a lot of basic mistakes its like they don't even know how to do combined arms, and i think this is the first war that small drones have been used so extensively to drop bombs, not sure if any military gets extensive training on how to deal with that.
