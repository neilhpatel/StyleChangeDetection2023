The show you are watching is playing with the term a bit I should think. There wasn’t a dedicated librarian in most country houses (to my knowledge). Rather, it was traditionally the role of the third footman to take care of the library. So when he was in that role perhaps he could be called ‘the librarian’, but his duties were not about collecting and categorising texts, but rather dusting and cleaning the room and lighting the fire in it along with cleaning the front hall, coat of arms, serving food to the housekeepers, and acting as a low tier lunch servant under the first and second footmen. So as you can see he has a low status and would not have been employed for literacy or book familiarity. In fact, being a librarian in late nineteenth century England fell across gendered lines, where more and more recently educated women took on the role in with ‘gender imbalances amongst the privileged class causing more women to not be married’ but as they were not well off enough financially to stay idle they thus took on the ‘ladylike form of paid employment [that] involved little physical strain’ that being a librarian offered (along with mental breakdowns as the above link showed).
Thanks for the great answer! I do have one question: What kind of books were used for this "stage dressing"? Were the titles important, or was it just a question of having a bunch of leather-bound books on the shelves - to be bought by the yard, perhaps? Could the books have been replaced by wallpaper with a bookshelf theme, or would people actually look at the titles and perhaps page through a couple of volumes?
