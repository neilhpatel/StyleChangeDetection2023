The source of that quote is the same German government which has made it abundantly clear in press announcements previously that they did not endorse the delivery of MBTs, and even rebuked a country for suggesting their provision without asking (Spain). There is little reason to believe they have not privately rejected or shot down any such requests, considering they had no qualms doing it publicly. And they have been caught obfuscating such things in the past during this conflict. They also publicly stated they don't care that the UK was sending Challengers, they want the US to take the initiative and send tanks (notably a goalpost shift from their previous policy of just not being first, to again avoid having to send tanks). But sure, Germany really just wants to provide them, and no one has asked Darn shame How convenient it aligns with current German policy on the matter though. Go figure.
So much information and misinformation. We hear that countries holding Leos want to send them, but aren't submitting formal requests. Then we hear that's not true. Then we hear Germany wants agreement from the US (!?), but the US has said it supports this plan. Then we hear Germany simply isn't behind this idea and gov't officials are in conflict.
