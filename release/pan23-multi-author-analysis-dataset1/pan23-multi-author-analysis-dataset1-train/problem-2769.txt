A labor law violation report has fewer rules, and is likely to effectively spawn off wage claims automatically for all relevant employees if it succeeds. As there is a group of people affected, this is likely the better option as it also minimizes the risk of retaliation.
I would suggest planning around the risk of retaliation, despite it being fairly unlikely. As I mentioned before, if the claim succeeds, retaliation, including termination, is definitely illegal and the status change is predated to even before the claim is filed.
1. Report to the DLSE the misclassification. This can be done by filing a wage claim. Retaliation such as firing, loss of hours, or cutting pay is illegal and should be reported to the retaliation division of the DLSE. File wage claims here: Expect the response to be several months.If you believe your employer is misclassifying you as an independent contractor, file a wage claim. The Labor Commissionerâ€™s Office may hold a hearing to determine if a worker has been misclassified as an independent contractor.
