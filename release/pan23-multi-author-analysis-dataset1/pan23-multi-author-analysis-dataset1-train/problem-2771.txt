Foreign land ownership is a complicated thing and can lead to all sorts of problems (can, not always does) but a big risk, that we've seen, is it allows the influx of foreign money to buy up swaths of property and keep them out of the market, affecting local housing costs and availability. It's not much different (conceptually) from what hedge funds and corporate equity are doing now. It's a problem even here in NYC where there are numerous apts/skyrises that are owned by wealthy Russian and Chinese nationalities but are effectively empty. They're just tax sinks for these people but it drives up the cost of living in the surrounding areas. Vancouver BC is also another city that has had to deal with this. Massive influx of Chinese money ran out housing for locals driving them from the available market even while the buildings are sometimes kept empty. And ib4 'but free markets!' driving local low-wage work forces to the outskirts of the city ends up putting pressure on traffic systems and drives money away from local businesses which leads to an erosion of tax income and a greater separation of wealth.
