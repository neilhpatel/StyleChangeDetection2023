Iâ€™m sorry that you are going through difficult times and that PTSD has a tendency to make us obsessive. While probably outside the realm of legal advice but no longer a top comment so hopefully it slides, there are some incredible journaling techniques out there for people with PTSD. They allow you reframe the trauma and imagine outcomes where you are in control or that are so silly that it breaks the tension. By forming new pathways for the thoughts that end in better ways, it helps break the cycle of retraumatization that occurs when we obsess and dream about the unchangeable past. Look in to Cognitive Processing Therapy and hopefully you can find some resources online for free in the meantime. Best wishes.
If you have any advice on anything specific I should include in my rebuttal to make things go a bit more positively for me, that would be awesome, though I've basically responded to every single claim the hospital has stated, including referencing the evidence to support my own claims.
So "I quit" will do that. So will "I am resigning effective [date]." Or "I am leaving and you can shove this job up your butt." Or whatever.
They did stop giving me shifts almost immediately after I reported severe harassment for the second time as my harasser only got more aggressive after my initial report. (They got him to admit his wrongdoing and got other coworkers to corroborate my stories.).
