I think the fallback is supposed to be the 25th Amendment and/or impeachment/removal and then using the 14th Amendment to bar that person from running ever again. Republicans don't have the integrity to make the tough decision. I believe this is because they don't want the stain on their party. Pence wouldn't use the 25A b/c then it would go down in history as Republicans being the first to use it. In my eyes that's the same reason the Republicans turned a blind eye to both impeachments. They would rather play politics and damage the credibility of impeachment as a proper tool of government than use it on their party.
