The Stamp Act Congress, a group of colonial leaders which convened in response to the Stamp Act in 1765, passed a declaring "That the people of these colonies are not, and from their local circumstances cannot be, represented in the House of Commons in Great-Britain.".
It also strikes me that it would then call the bluff of many of the patriots of the time who were taking issue with the idea of taxation, at all, instead of taking issue regarding the legitimacy of nonresponsible representation due to the readily apparent difficulties of communication and such in that period over the sorts of distances noted.
This is a great question. In the 1760s and 1770s, the American Patriots were arguing against various forms of taxation without representation, but they were primarily arguing against taxation, rather than for representation.
Nice straw man. I never said slavery had nothing to do with it. I said Slavery played a small part of the whole, but that a minute fraction of that came from somerset.
Slavery played a part (though a small one), yet this was much, much more inspired from the proclamations than from somerset. There was no great society of abolitionists in England in 1770-1780, and there was more championing for the cause of liberty to all (including those held in bondage) in America than anywhere else in the world at that time. It's just something that didn't play into the bigger picture the way 1619 alleged it did which has sent ripples through the community of historians.
