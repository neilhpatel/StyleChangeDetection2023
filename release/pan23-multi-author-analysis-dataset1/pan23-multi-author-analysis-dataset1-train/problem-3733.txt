Just to add on to the linked answer of mine. If we're talking specifically about the 1930s - and I'll restrict myself to just talking about the USSR - part of the problem with collectivization is that it combined problematic aspects of both private businesses and state planning.
Another big issue is that collective farms, while technically not state enterprises (there were also state farms but at this period in question they were relatively rare), were basically government contractors. They were expected to produce whatever crops (usually grain) were required by state planners, and were sold to the state at a fixed price, that was often much lower than what market grain prices had been in the years when private trading was allowed in the New Economic Policy. This meant that regardless of how much effort farmers put into production, or how many problems they encountered, they were still expected to sell such-and-such produce at such-and-such a price. The reason for the relatively low prices were that the economic planners were trying to guarantee affordable bread and foodstuffs to industrial and urban workforces, who bluntly were a higher priority under the Five Year Plans.
2. Relatedly, that the Soviet leadership turned to collectivisation too late, which left them no room to deal with the food crisis and exacerbated the famine, and that the Stalin leadership went from opposing collectivisation and promoting the slogan of "Get rich" and were orientated towards individualist farming methods up until just months before they turned to "complete collectivisation", and that in general they had no coherent plan.
R.W. Davies and Stephen Wheatcroft's massive Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture, 1931-1933 is a deep dive into the subject. There's also books specifically about the 1930s famines, like Anne Applebaum's Red Famine on Ukraine, and Susan Cameron's The Hungry Steppe about Kazakhstan.
