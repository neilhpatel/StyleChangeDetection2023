Yikes. When climate change spawns large scale food shortages, millions of Americans (even more than now) will yearn for an irrational madman who will tell them who to blame.

Narcissistic psychopathic leaders are never on anybodies side. They want the position of power, they don't want the responsibilities associated with it. Then they get bored and need to test how much power they have. Those tests start off small, but rapidly escalate into things obviously no one wants. But that is the point. How else can you test your power then to make people do terrible things to other people, and see if you get away. Beware of bored psychopaths. More people have been hurt, maimed, and/or destroyed by them then any other force on the planet through out human history.
