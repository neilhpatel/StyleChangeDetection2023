I feel schools need to focus on the basic curriculum, reading, writing, math, science. Focus on positive cultural contributions different cultures have made to our country and humanity along with a brief summary of the obstacles faced. I am a minority and racism has become worse the past few years because of the intense focus in my experience. Antifa in Oregon tried to enter my family’s neighborhood 3 times during the “summer of love.” The predominately white kids were shouting, “burn it down, burn it all down.” We (minority here) didn’t like our homes threatened/burned 2-3 generations ago and we don’t want it now. I wouldn’t have dreamed I would have had to worry about angry mobs 5-10 years ago. I support equality for all. I am an honorary aunt to trans kids. I loved and supported them as their assigned gender, now I love them and support them as their gender choice. What am I missing?
A bunch of republican parents got radicalized by a propaganda campaign of blatant lies and acted like total assholes to the people who educate their children?
That’s a great question. Yes and no to are they aware or not. Many of them are being taught to dislike teachers and public education. But they don’t fully comprehend why. It’s not uncommon to hear from a student “my dad said teachers are ruining America”, or some such thing.
