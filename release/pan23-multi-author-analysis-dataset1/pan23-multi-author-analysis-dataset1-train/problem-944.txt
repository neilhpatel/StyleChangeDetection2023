I don’t want to sound morbid, but I heard that at least some missing are presumed to be impossible to find as they have been destroyed… that’s incredibly sad on top of the already sad situation for anybody involved.
Not particularly. The momentum after Kherson was already very slow and back and forth. Kherson was the last territory that was very obviously indefensible for Russian supply. And TBF Soledar's capture was incredibly costly. Analysts estimate 5k dead and 10k wounded casualties from the Wagner force in taking it from a total of 40k. Those are Phyrric victory numbers imo.
You're essentially posting a pro-propaganda, anti-honest news message. "Careful reading things that might make you feel like Ukraine isn't winning every engagement and having great fun every day!".
Casualty rates for Ukraine have been consistently underreported. That said even NATO allied countries finally put out a number around the same as Russians casualty figures a couple weeks ago. Given that Russia is fighting in the offensive, that is actually a more favorable comparison between casualties than on average in a given conflict.
This is bad news. There is a lot of bad news coming out of Ukraine. They're fighting a war on their own soil!
