Quite informative Especially the tidbit about interracial marriages, and also the snippet about interracial marriages between non-Whites. Which reminds me, Bruce Lee married Linda Emery in 1964, which means they and many like them were illegally married at the time Interracial Marriages weren't legalize in the US until '67, I believe. Insane.
I'm more familiar with the history of school integration and one of the details that's always stayed with me from the Jim Crow era is that the history is populated with stories of children who attended a white-coded school with no real issue but when they moved, or there was a change in administration, a white school was no longer an option for them. The only thing that had changed was how the school administrator viewed the non-white or multi-racial child. There are instances of white school leaders in Texas classifying Hispanic/Latinx children as "colored" to avoid desegregated their schools post Brown but then changing their classification to white when they thought it would benefit them in court cases.
