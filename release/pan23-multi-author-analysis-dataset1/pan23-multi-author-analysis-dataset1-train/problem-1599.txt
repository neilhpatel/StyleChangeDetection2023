Much more common throughout the world was a system of raiding and counter raiding, often specifically for the purpose of taking captives, usually women and children, to be introduced into the new society. We have abundant evidence of these raids in the early historic period in the Northeast, as well as archaeological and oral history evidence of precontact warfare. Around 1300 CE we see an increase in palisaded villages, human remains with evidence of trauma and ritual torture, and female-heavy sex ratios in cemeteries indicating the taking of captives (Rushforth). In the Iroquois language the words for slave and dog share the same root of “to have as a slave or pet”, and some of the first gifts given to new European arrivals was an offer of captives as a sign of friendship (Cameron). The patterns established prior to contact would continue, especially as mortality due to disease, displacement, and warfare began dramatically influencing population dynamics in the Northeast.
First of all, thank you for taking the time to write all this up! I loved your write-ups on r/badhistory about the seven myths of conquest. I know I had a ton of questions here, so I appreciate that it's hard to really answer them fully.
