This is typical. In a totalitarian regime blame is usually pinned on the people who happen to be at the bottom of the pecking order, in this case conscripts, to save those higher up the power ladder. The company commander likely has no real experience and when he realized he screwed up and displeased his superiors, he attempted to save his sorry ass by using his conscripts as a scapegoat and denying he ordered the retreat.
Food for thought in the usa. With wanting to expand the death penalties and prison terms. Death is never a deterant. Look at the freed Russian prisoners. One group killed the commanding officer to escape. In another case, the fsb killed anyone who tried to retreat and they weren't even Prisoners. A few survived to escape and talk.
Will he be willing to give up land which has been pronounced as Russian for half a year (donbass) to four years (Crimea), and pay Ukraine huge sums of reparations, plus giving up lots of sovereignty (disarmament, being placed under international control etc)?
