where you I can find a listing of code enforcement offices specific to your region of Florida. Remember, squeaky wheel gets the oil, so keep calling until somebody gives you the help you need. And make sure to document everything you do; make a log of on what date and time you spoke to each and every person, what you told them, and what they said in return to you. If you can’t get this resolved fast enough, you may have to call a tenant rights lawyer - at least in Texas, I believe this months rent could have a deduction for the cost of staying in a hotel until you have running water again – but of course, you would want to confirm that with a lawyer first, who may even be able to charge their fees back to the landlord.
It is seriously good. I am a housing lawyer, and you're absolutely right in that it is often tricky for people to know how/where to find information appropriate for their jurisdiction and circumstance. I just wanted to make sure you knew your effort was noticed and appreciated.
