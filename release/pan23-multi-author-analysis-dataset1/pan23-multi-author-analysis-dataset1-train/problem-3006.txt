I’m extremely tired so I’m afraid I can’t give you the answer this deserves but I can speak from personal experience here. I myself have tried numerous treatments and nothing has helped, at best the meds make me feel like a zombie and at worst they amplify the thoughts/feelings drastically, and therapy doesn’t help chemical imbalances like it does normal trauma. Having gone through the ringer myself I can genuinely say I would probably do it. My wife gives me hope for a better tomorrow and I refuse to do that to her but at the end of the day I know I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for her and our future kids, I promised her I would never leave her alone and I intend to keep that promise but mental health issues are just so fucking exhausting and it feels damn near impossible to explain the toll they take on you to those that don’t suffer from the same conditions. This route also allows us to be more open with our mental health professionals in that we don’t have to lie to them and say “nah I don’t wanna die” just so we don’t get locked up involuntarily, instead we can be honest with them and say “I want to kill myself please help me” and have a genuine open discourse with them about additional avenues we can pursue for help (even if it means giving up after we hit our limit).
They're two separate issues. Its not "provide right to die comfortably" OR "provide healthcare". Not sure how cost figures into it. Not like the doctors prescribing get rewarded for "saving" cost. Your take just shows a complete lack of understanding of how the world actually works.
Negative. People with managed severe mental illness do have periods of clarity/lucidity/sound mind. If the management works quite well, they may be lucid most of the time. Still, they may not want to continue living under those circumstances.
