Secondary weapons may include a sword (for use against lightly armoured opponents) or a dagger. Note that the threat of the dagger was as useful as its effect - heavily armoured men could be wrestled to the ground and the threat of a dagger to the face would quickly compel them to surrender for a profitable ransom.
1. Swords were used by anyone who could get them because they are a practical tool for personal defense and a great secondary weapon on the battlefield.
Swords have the advantage of being versatile. A good sword can cut, thrust, parry, and any number of other things a weapon needs to do and do all of them well enough for the most part.
A spear, with some exceptions, is pretty much limited to the thrust. It's also more difficult, though still VERY doable, to wield a spear with a shield.
The axe is powerful, but requires more skill than you might think to wield on a battlefield. And is also vulnerable. You can't use a shield with an axe and you also can't form a wall of axes like you can spears. Your very powerful offensively, but very vulnerable. And for most people, battles were about surviving.
