The "best" solution to put a stop to this is to change all your passwords and recovery emails on all the accounts and services you use so your parents have zero access to any of those things, use the "log out all active sessions" option on any and all services that provide it, and set up 2FA wherever possible.
. Any system that requires additional verification besides just your password. Often, this involves getting a code texted to you when you try to log in, so no one can log in without both knowing your password and having physical access to your phone. There are also various apps that can be used for a similar purpose.
