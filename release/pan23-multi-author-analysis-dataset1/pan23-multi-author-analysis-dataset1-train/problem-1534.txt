After the first Punic War, Rome already recognized Carthage as a major threat. Rome's normal policy was to deploy four legions at a given time, but in recognition of the severity of the threat, the Romans doubled this to eight at the start of the Second Punic War, and then deployed all eight legions plus allies to the battlefield at Cannae.
I see. It has come to my attention that Rome, almost simultaneously, destroyed Carthage and Corinth. So it was a trend, to annihilate any \main\ players in the imperial game. Any other city that did stand out would have its head cut, sort of speak. Macedon, Athens, Sparta, Alexandria and the old powers were not as attractive, active or exuberant as Carthage. And even if they were, they were far away, in a safe distance away from Rome, while Carthage was too close for comfort. The punics failed in reading the room and did not recognize the ticking time bomb the romans were. In hindsight, how could they? After all, the mediterranean was their sea before Rome.
