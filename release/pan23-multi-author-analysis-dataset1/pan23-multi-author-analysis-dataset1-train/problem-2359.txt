To put it in a concise but incomplete manner, he argued that animals were machines/automata and that they did not have self-consciousness. The combination of these two statements are often interpreted as a denial of animals having feelings. However, Harrison pointed out that Descartes distinguished between sensations of bodily organs and conscious sensations. For instance, when you are sleepwalking you are not technically conscious of your sensations, but you are still navigating by relying on some of your senses. So within the system of argumentation set up by Descartes animals had feelings but they were not conscious of it. Or their feelings did not arise from self-consciousness as in the case of humans. Ultimately, Harrison’s main statement in his article is that Descartes merely pointed out that within the established system of reasoning about animals, there were ‘no irresistible reasons for asserting’ that animals had feelings.
I'm very lucky to live in a city where the library has a copy and am picking it up today. Will let You know if there's anything of value in it.
