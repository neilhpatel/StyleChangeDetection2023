Epstein was not properly protected. They threatened to label him a snitch and release him into general population. Epstein, faced with that threat which would have been certain death, recanted his story and said he had tried to kill himself. Epstein was put on suicide watch which was a form of torture. They took away every thing from him so he could not use anything to kill himself. And they put him on constant watch where he would be woken every two hours to make sure he was not dead (somehow). This was sleep deprivation torture. Epstein, not knowing what to do, changed his story once again and claimed he had not tried to kill himself.
And if, as you assert, Epstein had previously tried to kill himself - you have to ask yourself - why was he not on suicide watch still?
They put an organized crime hit-man into Epstein's cell and the guy tried to kill Epstein - but the murder was interrupted. The hit-man claimed he was not strangling Epstein but trying to resuscitate him. Epstein, when he came to told the guards the guy had tried to strangle him to death.
