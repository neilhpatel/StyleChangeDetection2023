Please don’t try to navigate this without an attorney. This will likely take years to settle, or to pass through the court system. Find a way to live your life without needing cash from this. Insurance companies count on people desperately needing cash now, and accepting $35,000 now, rather than the $750,000 that they would get a few years later. Even with the attorney taking a third, I hope you can see the value in having one. If you don’t get an attorney, the insurance will assume that they can pay you peanuts. I’ve been there.
for 1 it might make sense to settle for the policy limit since they are essentially judgement proof but for 2 you sue for [high number] and force the driver into bankruptcy and you get whatever you can out of that process. All of these decisions need to be guided by your attorney.
Get an attorney. This is clearly going to be over policy limits, which in OK the minimum is 25K. The insurance will try to cut that 25K check to settle the claim. What you need is an attorney to scout out if the driver has any assets to go after, and based on that file suit to try to get all of those assets. There will be two outcomes: 1) the guy makes no money is broke and doesn't own real estate 2) the guy owns property and/or has a high income.
Insurance companies do not take unrepresented people seriously. Just because an attorney can easily get the policy limit on a case does not mean that an unrepresented person can. There are also issues that non-attorneys simply are not capable of handling.
