Just for some context I'm a 47 yo lifetime Independent who doesn't like things about both parties and though I can't stand how far right the republicans are currently and the fact that they don't have any policies but only try to get votes by stoking culture wars, I know there's lots of us Independents who want fresh candidates for both sides and given a choice of a new face or Biden, the majority of independents (definitely not me though) will go with the new person.
