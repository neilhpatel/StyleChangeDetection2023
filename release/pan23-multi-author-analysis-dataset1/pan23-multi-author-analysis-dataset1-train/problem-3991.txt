Unless you knowingly misrepresented the item, you don't owe him anything. It doesn't matter what he thinks he needs or what may or may not be wrong with it. He's had it for days. For all you know he broke it, stole parts from it, or would return a different/broken item to you. Were I in your situation, would stop talking to him entirely. Don't answer his phonecalls, messages, emails, or any other way he is trying to contact you. Based on your previous interactions, he shows up at your door, I wouldn't answer it. I would call the police and let them talk to him. If you get a notice to appear in court, don't ignore it (or you could lose by default). Anything else, I would just ignore.
You may want to send a simple message to him via facebook stating that - the item(s) were found items as you had disclosed to him and sold "as is" so there are no refunds and you are not okay with him harassing you and showing up to your door and threatening you and you have reported it to the police and should he show up again you will call the police. That may be enough to stop his showing up again. I would suggest you save all the facebook messages and also make a note of date and time of when you sold him the items and when he showed up and what he said so you have a clear record all ready in case you have to go to small claims court or whatever happens. I would not open your door for this person though- just call the police if he shows up.
