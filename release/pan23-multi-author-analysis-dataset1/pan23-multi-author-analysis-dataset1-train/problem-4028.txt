(Personally I don't understand the reluctance. Pre-vaccine, I lost three family members to COVID and they were brutal deaths without anyone allowed in the room. Four friends got very sick, two lost their jobs, and one likely has permanent lung damage; she's 31 and otherwise was previously very healthy. They all likely caught it at work and/or caught it at work and spread to families. And these things are still happening. When I received by first shot it was a massive sigh of relief and I assumed things would start to go back to normal since everyone would get vaccinated. Boy was I wrong. But the principle here is to protect everyone, even the vaccinated who could acquire a breakthrough infection. We all have to work, and the workplace shouldn't be a potential death sentence.).
Codified under Montana’s Human Rights Act, House Bill 702 prohibits discrimination based on an individual’s vaccination status. It prohibits an employer from refusing employment, barring a person from employment, or discriminating in any term, condition, or privilege of employmentbased on vaccination status or whether the person has an immunity passport.
Of which there are few. Medical, yes. For example, someone undergoing chemo might be medically exempt. Have yet to see a viable religious exemption. Interesting that they are not allowing for testing.
