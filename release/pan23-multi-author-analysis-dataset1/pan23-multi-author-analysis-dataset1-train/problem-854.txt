Bruh we have minimum 100k cases a day in the US and that is a severe undercount cause rapid tests arent considered. And beasides India? COVID already ravaged through there.
The point is to buy yourself time to sufficiently respond to a wider spread via establishing systems to deal with its spread, boosting your hospital readiness/capacity, supply of pharmaceuticals, and vaccinations.
Even worse. Many economic migrants into cities only see their families once per year and otherwise live in dormitories with other factory workers since they can’t legally move their wife and kids into the city with them due to China’s migrant policies.
2. China doesnt really have a national cold chain that can distrubute the vax and MRNA doses are expensive. If you're going to spend the money a domestic vax is cheaper and creates jobs lol. There was legit discussion in chinese news that the MRNA vax would be approved in China around early mid 2021 when it was 99% effective against TRANSMISSION and symptoms, but with omicron subvarients pfivzer vax is only 80% effective against transmission and symptoms for 1 month, transmission effectivness falls to 60% after 3+ months. At that point, the MRNA vax simpily isnt that useful.
The MRNA vax case is more nuanced then that. Basically China's problem is that a lot of people refuse vax, when 0 covid was still around why risk any vaccine if there is no covid? there was 0 motivation. American anti-vax propoganda is popular in China through Japan and Taiwan. They translate pieces and it gets shared on Chinese internet. Offering MRNA shots isn't going to convince people to get vaxxed.
