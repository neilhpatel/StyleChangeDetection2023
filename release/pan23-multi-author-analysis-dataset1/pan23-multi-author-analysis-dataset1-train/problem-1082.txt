Yes, I think that basically, Creedence Clearwater Revival were kind of treated as a kinda-retro pop singles band, and so nobody really expected them to be authentic in that kind of way - it wasn't really a big part of what their appeal at the time rested on, which was instead largely that they had catchy songs, lean arrangements, and a lead singer with a great rock'n'roll voice. There was some contemporaneous commentary about The Band having Canadian origins (largely) and sounding like and having lyrical topics explicitly referencing the south ('The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down'), but The Band were a more critically lauded band who were seen as more important than Creedence in terms of their effect on pop music counterculture's direction because of their Bob Dylan links. But critical consensus on The Band was still largely complimentary in that regard; this might be because most pop music writing was largely Northern in origin, in places like San Francisco, Chicago, or New York, people for whom the Louisiana references were basically exotic in the first place.
Thanks I’ve wondered about this for over 20 years. It’s hard to imagine, given the later obsession with authenticity in pop culture, that music fans just let slide Fogerty’s affected accent and references to Southern locales he’d barely ever been, much less could rep, but I guess it was a simpler time!
