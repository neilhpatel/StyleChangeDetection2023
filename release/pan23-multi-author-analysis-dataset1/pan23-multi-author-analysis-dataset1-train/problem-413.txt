Youâ€™re expected to carry on like nothing happened? Except for all the memorials I visited in Quebec City alone. Except for the fact that French has been instated as an official language of the entire country, even the parts of it where no one has even met a French person. Illogical accusations of racism? The hijab ban? The discrimination and removal of minority language speakers? The treatment of natives?
The treaty of Paris of 1763 that ceded Canada and Acadia (as they were defined at the time) explicitly contained protections of the Catholic faith, of the traditional French legal systems and traditions, and also contained explicit permissions for those residents who did not wish to be part of this whole thing the freedom to leave if they chose to. Those freedoms were reaffirmed in the Quebec Act of 1774 and the Constitutional Act of 1791.
