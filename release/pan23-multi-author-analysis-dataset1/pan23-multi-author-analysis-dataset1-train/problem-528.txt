Also it really helps if you are specific and prove you’ve tried to find legal counsel. Instead of saying “Im struggling to find someone to take this case” change it to “I have contacted X, Y, and Z companies on X, Y, and Z dates, all of which did not work out due to issues on their end. Word it better than I did but you get the gist.
This is true, but finding an attorney willing to take it on is going to be less about whether the attorney "thinks she has a case" and more about whether she is "going to be able to pay" or the attorney is "willing to to do it for free or for a reduced hourly rate" because even if she has a slam dunk defense (nothing is ever actually a slam dunk) it's going have to be some sort of retainer/pro bono arrangement.
Don't panic. Call the "Civil Court Clerk's office" for the municipality or city that you're in. Tell them you want to move the date back to something more reasonable for yourself, as you want to find representation but are struggling to find anyone to take the case at the moment. You can suggest another date whether it be in December, January or all the way back to May 2022.
