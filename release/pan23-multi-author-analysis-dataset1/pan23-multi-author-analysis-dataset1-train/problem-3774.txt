They lost by 8% in 2018 and won by 7% in 2014, a 15% gap. They got the same number of seats in both elections, and the maps and the software they used to design them have only gotten more sophisticated since 2010. They're protected against fluctuations of that magnitude. 10% is too low. Something like 50% of the Republican base would have to leave the state for Democrats to stand a chance of winning half the seats. A quarter of the state's population isn't going to be leaving to move to Idaho of all places, especially since they're already in control here.
Literally. Idaho is like the shitty parts of Washinon and oregon with none of the good parts. I don't understand why it's so much more conservative and backwards than frankly any of the states around it. Montana and Wyoming and Utah are so much more chill than Idaho.
Similar experiences. From the south. Went to a Uni in Spokane for a year and a half before transferring. I saw Naziâ€™s at Walmart in North Spokane. Saw lots of aryan nation stuff and Nazi stuff in CdA.
