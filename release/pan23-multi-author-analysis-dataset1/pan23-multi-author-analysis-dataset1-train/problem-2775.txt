I'd like to flip this around, actually: I don't think AH readers realize how much it means to me--to us--that you're out there interested in history, and in getting into the grit of history instead of TIL.
Seriously. I am an actual historian (as in, got a bachelor's degree in history, got a few papers published in the field, and intend to get a master's and/or doctorate in history when I have the funds for grad school, unfortunately not currently employed as a historian), but because my area of expertise is relatively narrow, this subreddit is quite often the best source of info for me on subjects I am unfamiliar with. I just wish I had the time and resources on hand to make my replies as well sourced as some of the other folks here (I tend to only surf reddit when I'm at work, and my work doesn't permit me access to my bookcase, or any nearby libraries). This subreddit is awesome, and the curation of the mods is the reason for that. I have had my replies and questions deleted before, and when that happens, I generally can't even get mad because they explain why it was deleted, and then usually DIRECT YOU TO THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION ANYWAY. They're just that good.
This brings me to a suggestion - perhaps this has been raised previously but should the mods or the wider community get together and select a charity (or perhaps a selection of charities) that have been approved and accepted by the mods and/or wider community as organisations which positively contribute to sharing knowledge and teaching the importance learning and studying historical events from an impartial, unbiased and objective.
