The attack on Poland came as the culmination of a great political crisis, but it wasn’t the direct result of faulty diplomacy or Hitler’s miscalculation, but a deliberate decision to start a world war.
Hitler looked at the greater picture through his delusional world-view and recognized that the USA would eventually challenge German hegemony, and that Germany needed to prepare itself for that struggle.
Hitler had some vague plans of invading mainland USA eventually, but Germany needwd first to construct a massive surface fleet, which in turn meant defeating Great Britain if Germany hoped to reach America.
This invasion was merely the latest scheme in Hitler’s plan for making Germany self-sufficient in resources, and eventually rise up to challenge the United States, and he had gotten away with much. Appeasers then and now have contended that Hitler’s aims were modest and reasonable. Uniting German-speakers with Germany, sounds logical enough. But this was incidentally also the means by which Germany would dominate Europe, both by incremental increases in resources and by superior geostrategic positioning.
Sorry, this last part seems wrong. Hitler's view of the US wasn't fixed and unchanging. His second book was written in 1928, when he was impressed by the US, attributing its success to the Nordic element of the US population. After he came to power in 1933, Hitler was discounting the US entirely.
