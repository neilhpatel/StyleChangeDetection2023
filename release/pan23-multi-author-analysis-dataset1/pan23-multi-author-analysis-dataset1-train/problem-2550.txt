I don’t fully understand this. Someone in the conservative sub also said that it’s clear “we” (meaning conservatives) don’t want McCarthy. Is that actually true? He’s still getting the vast majority of R votes… anyone the others choose have at most gotten 20 votes. I’m not saying he’s not a loser generally cuz he is but to me it’s like everything else republicans have ever done: cry foul and vote something down without an alternative plan put into place. It’s just grandstanding.
ABC we’re interviewing versus congressmen / women throughout the day and one of them said there isn’t an appetite for this to continue beyond a day and at a certain point, one of them has indicated they would switch to “no” meaning that he was more than 5 away and that would trigger an abandonment of McCarthy and move in to another candidate.
He was a wrestling coach. Sorry, but being around young guys all day who are wearing tights and touching each other makes Gym a little bit suspect in my view. Then, making excuses for the “head” coach’s inappropriate behavior towards said boys….
