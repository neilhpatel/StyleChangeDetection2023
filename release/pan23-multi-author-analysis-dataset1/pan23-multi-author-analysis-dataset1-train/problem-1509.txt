It will be even worse. It will make it so all laws pertaining to elections cannot be vetoed by the Governor, that state courts cannot interfere with elections (including declaring electoral maps as unconstitutional), that ballot initiatives and referendums relating to elections can't happen anymore, and that all independent commissions are dissolved as only the state legislatures can make electoral maps. It will make combating partisan gerrymandering virtually impossible. The worst part about ISL is that it could potentially allow the legislatures to completely void election results that they don't like, which could lead to permanent Republican control of the government as right now the Republicans control enough state legislatures that if they win all of the states that have Republican control in both chambers (or the single chamber in Nebraska's case) they'll have over 270 electoral votes. ISL wouldn't perpetuate the two party system. It will lead to it being replaced with a one party system and elections becoming nothing more than symbolic gestures similar to countries like Hungary and Belarus.
