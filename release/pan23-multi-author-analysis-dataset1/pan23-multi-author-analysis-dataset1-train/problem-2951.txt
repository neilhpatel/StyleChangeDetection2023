More recently, Reddit introduced a new ‘Snoo style’, and as such, we thought it was only right for us to commission a new collection to join them, and now it is time for you to start meeting them! Starting today, and continuing for the next several Sundays, we’ll be rolling out a selection of the new Snoos, along with a brief biography of the historical figures they are based on. We’ll also be soon incorporating them into into our next collection of AskHistorians swag, which can be won by our end of the year Awardees… and is also . You'll get to meet the rest of the crew over the coming weeks.
Empress Xiaoqin 孝欽, known for most of her life as the Dowager Empress Cixi 慈禧 (Tsysi ᡮᡟᠰᡳ), is perhaps one of the most iconic political figures of the late imperial era in China, though the extent and nature of her role in the period’s history is still debated. Entering the imperial family in 1851, she came to hold varying degrees of power at court until her death in 1908, shortly before the collapse of the Qing state.
Tbf I agree. The literary Chinese language in particular, due to its compactness, is very often open to different interpretations. Given how the court was notorious for literary inquisition in Qing dynasty, even if it wasn't the intention all along, I think they would definitely have considered the interpretation of "ruling together", and decided to proceed with it still.
These are great but I'm slightly freaked out. I introduced my high school students to Dowager Empress Cixi less than two hours ago, then this appears in my feed...
