Do not tear down the fence - you don’t know what you don’t know until you’ve actually tape measure it. They are in the right if the survey is correct. You’ll end up paying more for the fence that is in its correct place. CA only looks at the survey even the county would not be involved. You will lose in court most likely unless you have easement written on your deed. You don’t have easement then you lose. Move on.
If you aren't able to prove that the driveway has been in place long enough, which in CA is a continuous period of at least 5 years, open & notorious, then you may be in a bit of a pickle because the neighbor reset the clock by interrupting the continuous period of adverse use required.
Agreed. I also share a driveway with my neighbor and the easement is documented. Luckily, we get along fine and haven't had any issues. Two previous owners before them were cool, too. If I was OP, I would tear the fence down and get my documents ready for a legal battle. Their neighbor is playing with fire.
