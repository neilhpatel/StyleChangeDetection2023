What exactly was the policy you violated? Depending on your state, your final pay may be required within 72 hours or simply by the next pay day. The manner in which you were terminated, while not ideal, isn’t illegal. There’s no law that says you must be fired in a quiet private room. It’s a shitty move and has to be great for morale /s.
It sounds like the accommodation you requested was "I should be allowed to give the phone to other co-workers" but your employer may have determined that this request wasn't reasonable and would cause an undue burden on the employer if other co-workers had to be pulled away from their job duties to handle phone calls that were your responsibility.
I 100% think I was fired for my hearing issues. They had told me that when I can’t hear a person I need to focus more and that when I can’t hear someone on the phone it’s not okay to pass the phone on to someone who can hear them.
So my hearing issues were an issue as I dealt with phone calls and talking to people. I purchased my own hearing amplifier for the phone system. But i still struggled.
