There are of course other community that do aim more for what you'd suggest, and that's great Different spokes for different folks and all that But this community is after something rather specific. Not DebateHistorians, not DiscussHistory, not AskNotHistorians but AskHistorians.
This is not really "implied". No one asks for a contributor to be a historian in order for them to post. Many flaired users are not. Others are, and there are non flaired users who may very well be. In fact, outside of verified AMAs, disclosing one's credentials is not something the mods or the flairs would ever demand, at least for obvious privacy reasons. Which is why the requirements, albeit somewhat more strict than most other subreddits, are tailored to examine one's ability to engage with the subject from a historical perspective and to have a slightly better than basic command of the main sources.
I completely agree! My biggest problem with this sub is that there are so many posts with nothing but deleted comments.
