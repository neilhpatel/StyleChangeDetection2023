Defense : late roman legionnaries used round oval / lenticular shield (scutum), a ridge helmet that covered, mail shirts (lorica hamata) that covered the arms and thighs and for some military units scale armors (lorica squamata) particularly usefull against arrows.
The more dangerous medieval weapon for a late roman would be heavy crossbows but a para-phalanx formation would protect roman soldiers advancing on the battlefield.
We could well imagine that this type of compact formation with the roman discipline faced against unevenly armored medieval soldiers as well as light cavalry could prevail.
It is always hard to imagine battles between soldiers from differents eras but as for medieval and roman era soldiers, technology (spurs notwithstanding) didn't evolve much, until the massive use of powder weapons.
As for the cavalry, the difference with the cavalry/chivarly of the medieval period is that the spurs weren't invented and used yet (it became common after 600 for the "Byzantine" soldiers) so that the roman army cavalry had less shock while using a spear but still used it (as well as javelines, plumbatas and bows) to fight against cavalry and infantry.
Wow thank you very much for a thourough and elaborate answer. What’s your opinion, why didn’t he medieval armies employ the same principles and build from there? Were they just lost or forgotten during the Fall of the empire?
