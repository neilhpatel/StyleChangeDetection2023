Yeah he's older than me throws around jargon to sound like he knows what he's talking about and I was dumb enough to fall for it. I've already learned enough to know he's full of shit.
Disclosure can come in the form of an addendum to the contract, a natural hazards disclosure and report created by a third party, or a title report generated by a title company.
Glad you got a real lawyer. Did you check the county assessor's website for this land? Most should be freely accessible online, often with address search and a GIS-based mapping tool. If you can search the address, or find where the land is on the map, it should tell you the owner (presumably not updated yet since your questionable sale), the size of the parcel, and structures associated with the lot. It'll at least gives you a bit more of an idea about the situation than what you seemingly are portraying here. Good luck.
Call your county registrar of deeds tomorrow morning and ask for the deed history of the house and the lot it sits in -- you need to determine if you were actually recorded as the owner of anything, if the scammer ever was listed as the owner of the property, if there are any undisclosed liens on either, and if the lot has any existing easements or has been recently divided. Also see if you can find any record of building permits issued for the property, as they might contain information that would help you.
