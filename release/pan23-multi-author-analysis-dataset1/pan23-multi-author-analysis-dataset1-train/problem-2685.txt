MOHELA services federal student loans, they get money based on the number of accounts they service (it’s more nuanced and more detailed than that, but for simplicity’s sake that’s all imma get into right now) MOHELA is an organization created by the State of Missouri’s state legislators and it uses the money it makes to fund support for the students of Missouri, so it’s like a weird quasi-nonprofit arm of the state of Missouri’s gov.
No. Part of what the Supreme Court does is judge the constitutionality of a given law, but that's not the entirety of what they do.
