Thousands of pages have been written on the population transfers that happened because of the creation of Greece, from the early 19th century up until the '20s. What about Armenia?
Im really confused, lets say the german army in WWII, did standard soldiers wear ear plugs, if no then what is there reaction going into battle while panzer or stug fires the main gun, wont there ear just go deaf for like hours, the panzer crews have headsets yes, and the guy who fire artillery cover their ears right before they fire, so how does the soldier react if he didnt know when a panzer would fire.
Who was the last person put to death by the Roman Inquisition? And do we have an approximate calculation of the death toll of this institution? Thanks.
Western Armenia (ie, the tablelands in Eastern Anatolia around Lake Van) were very ethnically mixed by the late 19th century (although population records and historians differ as to what the percentages were), and this area was very much affected by population transfers similar to those between Greece and Turkey. Namely, especially during and after the 1915 Armenian Genocide, a massive proportion of refugees and deported civilians moved from Eastern Anatolia into Syria and Eastern (ie, Russian-then-Soviet) Armenia.
Of course, even those transfers are part of a much broader and wider history of forced deportations on both sides of the Caucasus, starting with the Circassian deportations (considered by Circassians to be a genocide) in the late 19th century, and the population transfers (ie, deportations with a high mortality rate) of north Caucasian nationalities such as the Chechens in 1944.
