Roman culture was not a dry sponge waiting for Greek myth, ritual, and beliefs to fill the void. The Romans inherited an Indo-European pantheon, which paralleled that of the Greeks. At the same time, Roman (and Greek) myths, ritual, and beliefs were no doubt affected by a local non-Indo-European substrata. As was the case elsewhere, there were many changes over time that made Roman traditions distinct. Nevertheless, when they encountered the pantheons of other Europeans, many things seemed familiar. Romans usually attempted to fit the familiar gods of foreigners into their Roman counterparts, taking them to be local manifestations of their own supernatural beings.
Thank you for all the responses! You've entertained my curiosity long enough, but if I could impose upon you one more time: can you think of an example where the Roman version of a Greek myth reflects something distinctly Roman?
I've seen it claimed in a few different places that the Romans had their own pantheon, religion, and ritual, but none of their own myths, in the sense of elaborate stories about those gods and their descendants. The myths they eventually did write down were revisions of Greek myths they absorbed, which is why people talk about Greek myth, but not Roman myth.
Absolutely. This influence reverberated as well in the pantheons and stories of the Germanic and Celtic speaking worlds, recorded after conversion to Christianity. That process of conversion necessarily blurred the vision, muddled by an attempt to look back after several generations following conversion, but the evidence from those sources, combined with some pre-conversion references, affirms that the influence of the Indo-European pantheon and legacy was sustained. At the same time, we must concede that folklore changes over time and space, so there were changes.
