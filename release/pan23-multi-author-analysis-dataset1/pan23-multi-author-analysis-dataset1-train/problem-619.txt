Like Trump scared them off? Journalists have devolved into degenerate vultures picking at the carcass of the mass output and consumption of information.
"Where are you from?" is an acceptable question. What's not acceptable is not accepting the answer given and then demanding a more in-depth answer regarding your entire family history. ESPECIALLY when that family history involves your ancestors being snatched from their homelands, so the current generations honestly does not even know what parts of the continent they even hail from in order to correctly answer that question.
But none of this changes anything. "Traumatized" was once a word that we used to describe the mental state of a child who witnessed their parents being killed in a bombing... A child who may never be able to function like a normal human being. I find it completely ridiculous that the word "traumatized" now describes the mental state of this child AND an adult human being who has been subjected to verbal insults and I don't see how anyone else finds it sensible to define words in such a manner that "traumatized" is used in both of these scenarios.
What point? Is it that “wokeism” is a scourge on society, and we’re all doomed because suddenly being an ass or a bully is frowned upon? Trauma is a wound. Petty aristocrats like the royals have been getting “wounded” by far less for ages. People have been speaking out for decades about how it feels to be repeatedly questioned about where they “really” come from just because they aren’t white.
