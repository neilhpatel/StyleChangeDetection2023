So first, it met those needs from multiple sources, including clean sources and coal from other sites. Probably not the tooth fairy... And two nope the town was a town before a coal company decided to move in and push out the residences. The town is dying / dead because a company is trying to push out and demolish it to access the coal. This isn't a story of an old mining town that has been neglected and forgotten. The RWE energy company is planning to demolish the entire village. The town won't exist if the protestors lose.
Which can be mitigated by increasing solar production, as solar and nuclear are excellent companion technologies.
No one was pushed out. They were all very well compensated and relocated to other villages. All this was completed in 2006 based on an agreement in 1997.
Cost to pay for Merkle's irrational anti-nuclear position, and a general overestimation of the viability of 'green energy'.
"I guess you havent been reading the news lately. The last 8 winters have been the warmest on record and that trend shows no signs of slowing.".
I may be wrong, but my understanding was that Germany had met its need for energy (so no frozen dead citizens) and the protest was because a coal company was trying to evict the towns people to extract more coal that is not needed to meet the current needs of the country.
