NAL - but a now retired engineer - I've been through this process continuously for the past 50 years. Record everything factually and truthfully on your SF-86, keep your original physical paperwork (birth certificates, etc.) in a folder. When done with the SF-86 turn it in. They (your company's facility security officer [FSO]) will review it with you, then submit it. An investigator will see this and have a meeting with you (which is normal). Walk through everything on the application, asking more questions - again very normal. Being factual, truthful and forthright is the most important aspect of all of this. Bring your folder with all of your paper documentation and let them make copies. You have just saved the investigator a ton of time - and they will appreciate this. They will know now where to look to verify all of this. The investigator will use all of this information to collect more/verify information and turn it over to the adjudication committee for their processing.
Adding to NanoRaptoro. Just be honest in your paperwork. I was born in California. Parents are Mexican. They applied for me to have Mexican citizenship. So I now have a Mexican birth certificate, Mexican passport, US passport and birth certificate.
My parents did it through the Mexican consulate so none of it was done in Mexico. Although the Mexican consulate did mess up my brotherâ€™s passports. I had to call my mom since she has all the documents other than my US ones and when she was looking them over only now noticed that my brothers were listed as mexicana instead of Mexicano. So whoops on that front. Probably will get fixed at one point.
