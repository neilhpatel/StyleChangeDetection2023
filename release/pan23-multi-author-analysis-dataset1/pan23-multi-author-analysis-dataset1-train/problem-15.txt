That's a fair question. "Claim" is not the word/concept I should have used, because it was not the case that he said "my grandmother was once queen so suck it, I deserve to be king." (I was fixated on explaining why the claim wasn't about the Beauforts.) Catherine was his greatest claim to legitimate royal blood and to being related to Henry VI - his descent from Catherine made him Henry's (half-)nephew, which allowed him to be the predominant Lancastrian heir following the death of Henry's son, Edward, at the Battle of Tewkesbury. Edmund and Jasper Tudor had been given noble educations, titles, estates, and military responsibilities on the basis of their being the half-brothers of the king, and without those it's extremely unlikely that the future Henry VII would have had the position - either in the royal family or in aristocratic English society - to be taken seriously as a contender to the throne.
Great answer, thank you! Although I am intrigued by your statement that Henry's main claim was through Catherine of Valois; I knew that she was his paternal grandmother, but I was unaware that this was of significance to his claim. After all, Catherine only became Queen consort through marriage, and her father was Charles VI of France- so wouldn't using her to legitimise Henry's claim be equivalent to claiming that the French had a claim on the English throne? She was Queen of England, yes, but as far as I know she had no inherent claim to the throne. Which I thought was why Henry mostly staked his claim on the right of conquest- since neither side of his family was very helpful, his father being the son of a Welsh courtier and a French princess, while his mother was connected to the royal family only through illegitimate descent, as you said.
