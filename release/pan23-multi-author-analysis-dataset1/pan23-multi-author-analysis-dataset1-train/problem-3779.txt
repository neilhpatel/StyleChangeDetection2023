Finland has “joked” that they don’t want their own land taken in the Winter War for the exact reasons I just listed. That land is now so far below their quality of life.
Yeah, i read that in every reddit thread since februar and in every thread the answer is "but nukes" followed by people arguing about state of disrepair and mathematic calculations where even 1% of them working is catastrophic. And the usual armchair armaggedon enjoyer chiming in randomly to let us know their desire to see people die on a massive scale.
Exactly. The Soviet "Union" was made by kicking the shit out of dozens of ethnic groups and smaller countries that had zero interest in joining with Russia. Some of them left in 1992, but not all.
Nostalgia? Imperialism isn't the past for Russia. They still hold shitloads of territory they conquered / settled from other ethnic groups, and they are still exploiting those ethnic groups and directing the wealth generated into Moscow. Even during this war they've shown they don't give a damn about Russian citizens if they aren't ethnically Russian.
