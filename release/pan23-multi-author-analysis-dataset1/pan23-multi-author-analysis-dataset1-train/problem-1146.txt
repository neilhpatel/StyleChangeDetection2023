I assume you intend to mean "give 50k dollars to 240 immigrants " instead of investing 12m into infrastructure that could recruit future Americans into quickly adjusting to residential status amd becoming contributing taxpayers.
Hard to know the worst part about this. Most of the 12 million is for legal defense for the state of Florida. It sends the message that anything is legal if you have enough money.

Exactly. This asshole has the worst housing inflation in the entire US. Florida needs workers. They especially need folks to build houses. But hey we got to be woke. Also, enjoy the 20 percent hike on our energy prices. A fucking state that could supply all of its energy from solar panels is pulling this shit. Also good luck with homeowners insurance. There is a chance you will not be able to insure your home at all in the near future.
