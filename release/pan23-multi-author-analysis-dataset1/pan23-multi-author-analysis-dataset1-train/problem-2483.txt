Also what was the reaction of the people of France to Thermidor itself? In that movie produced by the French government for the 300th anniversary(200th?) everyone was super hyped to have Robespierre's head chopped off. Is that the case?
I HIGHLY recommend Peter McPhee's biography of Robespierre Robespierre, a Revolutionary Life. I also think it's a damn shame more of Robespierre's speeches haven't been translated into English, because it is fascinating to read them and to compare them with popular portrayals of him.
Now it wasn't as stark as sometimes painted-- where Robespierre makes a speech, disappears, and then comes back in Thermidor, but throughout May, June, and July he was absent from public life more than he was a part of it. In fact a controversial topic is actually how much Robespierre was even involved in the so-called 'Great Terror', as he was absent from public life during the increase in executions. McPhee even makes a statement that I find incredibly intriguing and would love to dig into more, that perhaps Robespierre's enemies (he had already given a few vague speeches about 'enemies within the Convention') used the Law of 22 Prarial and an increase in tribunal executions to ruin Robespierre's good standing with the people. In perhaps the most interesting bit of credence to this idea, we never see arrest warrants coming from Robespierre, but during his absence at the HEIGHT OF THE TERROR Robespierre appears to save around seventy Girondins from execution () who appealed to him directly as their savior (he had previously saved them from the Guillotine when the 22 proscribed Girondins were executed and there were calls to include the 'seventy-five' who had signed a petition saying the disagreed with the purge of the Girondins in the insurrection of May 31 - June 2). Robespierre also appears another time to call into question some 300 suspects rounded up by a highly suspect Representative on Mission, and had all 300+ freed.
