The articles about humanity reaching 8B already mentioned that population is expected to decline, not due to climate change but due to improved living conditions reducing birth rates.
Let it burn. Maybe actual climate catastrophe is what is needed to bring people together and have peace. Anyways, what are we saving it for; more war, violence, hate? So much effort is being put into carbon emissions but what about the obvious; how much is environmental damage has been done by Russa alone to Ukraine, along with other countries threating wars (ie china wants tiwan, n korea wants to nuke most everyone). Let's focus on whats infront of us first.
With the support of "Loss and Damage" financing, COP27 has made it possible for developing countries to adequately respond to the dangerous climate disasters they are currently experiencing. This is a big move because in the past, affluent countries frequently "sidelined" the conversation on climate financing and did nothing to compensate poor countries who were severely affected by climate change. The fact that it has only recently been implemented means that the question of whether wealthy, developed nations will actually contribute trillions of dollars and accept responsibility, as well as the general allocation of funds and the prompt distribution of funds to the affected nations, all remain unanswered. We can only hope that COP27 will mark a turning point for the environment of the world and that nations will work together to achieve that goal.
