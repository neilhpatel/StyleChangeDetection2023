We shouldn't be. The sale of vital infrastructure to foreign nations is a national security risk. Even if they don't use it against us directly, if we ever have to forcefully nationalize a company and seize it from a foreign government, it will impact our ability to trade in the future.
Yup. We can tell Putin to fuck off and get lost. We can tell MBS to fuck off and get lost. I don't think we can tell em both at the same time. Choose the lesser evil. You'd think given what happened, MBS wins that fight with 10 fingers in his nose, but, ya know. Fuckin' Vlad, you dickhead.
However, this document being made public without the foresight of having a strongly worded speech by the president or at very least the press secretary first (many officials in-between that could give weight to such a statement) before hand was a foolish oversight.
Lol. What a brain dead take. Iraq was about preventing Sadam from cornering the oil market with non-petrodollars you twit.
Realpolitik. At best, the extremist green stance of 'just invest it _all_ in solar and wind' can say 'told you so': We are 2 orders of magnitude away from being capable of replacing the energy needs of the world, certainly of 'the west', with renewables in a short time span, it's __utterly__ impossible to do that. We can do it in a decade or two and we should do that (and we are, and we should probably go faster). But that is __irrelevant__ for the short term political reality of the situation the world finds itself in today. "Just freeze to death for 9 winters but then we might be able to unthaw you with our fancy new solar and wind systems" is cold comfort.
