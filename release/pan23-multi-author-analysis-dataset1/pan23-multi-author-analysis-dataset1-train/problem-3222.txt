For example, the Spanish in what is today New Mexico among the 20-odd Pueblos (who speak seven languages from four language families) asked about the peoples living to the west and southwest, and were told of two distinct but related bands of enemies, one called simply "Enemy" and the other "Enemy, of [from] the Planted Fields." Those words, approximately "Uh'pachu" and "Uh'pachu de nabahu," bounced around 17th Century Spanish documents and New World language and eventually wound up as what we know today: Apache and Navajo, despite these nations using "Tindé" and "Diné" - both meaning "The People" - in their Athabaskan languages. All lovers of irony should appreciate then that a NavajoDiné word meaning "ancestors of our enemies" was applied to the American Southwest's magnificent pueblo dwellings scattered from Utah/Colorado to Mexico, and remains popular today despite the Pueblos' best efforts to replace the well-known "Anasazi" with the more accurate but syllabic mouthful of "Ancestral Puebloan.".
Due to the general use of indio for all native population groups, pre-colonial identifications were strongly simplified and homogenized, as in most other (Spanish) American regions. Already in the 2nd half of the 16th century casta terms including indio, but also español and mestizo played an increasingly major role in colonial administration and the justice system. Spanish was the only admitted language before colonial courts, which further increased the role of the indio concept for Spaniards and native people alike.
1. The comments on the first post do show that Columbus made an error in mis-labeling America to India and the people as Indians.
