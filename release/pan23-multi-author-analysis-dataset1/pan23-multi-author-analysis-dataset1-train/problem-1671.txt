It’s probably not possible and / or ill advised. Russia probably has many “alternative paths” to the internet for that very situation. I’m sure they would retaliate too. There’s stuff you can do though. Work in IT right at the start of the war in Ukraine we started blocking all Russian/old soviet countries IPs. Mostly for email but also for services that allowed us to restrict login by country. That single change alone accounted for a massive reduction in phishing and malicious login attempts. They now have to use VPNs but it’s pretty easy to tell who they are because the login attempts happen during the Russian day it’s just annoying because we have to do a deeper analysis to see if we can safely block that IP. (Depends on what server they are using for VPN).
>Żaryn also said that cyberattacks are increasingly being used to spread Russian disinformation and obtain data and confidential information by Russian intelligence. He added that the operation performed simultaneously by these two methods is referred to as GhostWriter. It involves attacks on email addresses and accounts in social networks of public figures from Central and Eastern European countries, mainly from Poland. He emphasized that perpetrators are trying to seize control of information platforms for spreading Russian disinformation. In recent months, this operation has focused on Poland.
