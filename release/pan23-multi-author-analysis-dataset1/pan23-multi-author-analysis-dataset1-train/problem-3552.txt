I'm not sure whether you fully understand the concept of degrowth. Within the framework, there can and should still be growth within individual sectors (e.g. medicine) and there can even be overall growth in an economy – if other factors are met. It's also not blind of underdeveloped countries, in which growth is vitally important to raise the standard of living. However, in wealthy societies with a stable political and economic system, degrowth shifts its focus from perpetual growth to a stable equilibrium, in which wellbeing, planetary health and other factors are the relevant "KPIs". Where human wellbeing requires investment and growth, degrowth supports and even demands it. It, however, doesn't support growth in sectors that are only in it for monetary growth or whose societal or ecological externalities aren't balanced out by their benefits.
Degrowth is a complicated topic with an unfortunate and misleading name, but many serious economists are involved in the movement, so you can be quite certain that the goal isn't just to turn off growth and live happily ever after.
I love it when science works for the good. If only we knew in the ‘80’s, what we just figured out. RIP uncle Rudy, my gay uncle who died in New York City.
