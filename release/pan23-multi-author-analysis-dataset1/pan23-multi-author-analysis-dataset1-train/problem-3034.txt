Third, do yourself a favor and don’t make foolish assumptions about people based on things they never said, beliefs they don’t hold, and projections of your own feelings. If anyone here feels shitted on, it isn’t me.
It reminds me about the Chen Sheng Wu Guang uprising, where soldiers delayed by a quake realised the penalties for being late and for rebellion were both death, concluding they would be better off rebelling against the Qin dynasty; sure, they failed but other subsequent revolts overthrew them.
Are they? I would imagine killing thousands of people for peacefully protesting is just going to make everything infinitely worse. Because not only were a bunch of people's loved ones killed but now the punishment for killing a police officer or soldier is the same as peacefully protesting there's really nothing to lose. Might as well go out in a fight rather than be tortured to death.
Second, neither I nor the original commenter said ANYTHING whatsoever about supporting or approving of or even mentioned autocracies so your claim continues to lack any relevance to the comment or conversation.
