Trump became the 10th highest paid professional athlete in the US because of all the money the government paid him for golf. Hi son in law started a $2 billion investment fund with no investment experience because of his position that was only given to him through nepotism.
Is gas still high where you are? Prices around here dropped right after midterms. I paid 2.35 / gal 2 days ago.
So now when Republicans pretend to care about a President enriching his family from his position even though their President, the only President to never serve the American people prior to being President and by far the richest President ever, clearly enriched himself from the office it's difficult to just ignore their apathy or outright defence of the very thing they are accusing the Bidens of.
I said it yesterday, I'll say it again. When you talk to conservatives online, pretend to be one, and say I didn't vote for them to investigate Biden. It's the same thing Democrats did to Trump, and it went nowhere. I want them to tackle helping me feed my family, cause I can't afford shit in this economy with inflation, gas, and increased prices for everything. I do wonder what their responses will be.
