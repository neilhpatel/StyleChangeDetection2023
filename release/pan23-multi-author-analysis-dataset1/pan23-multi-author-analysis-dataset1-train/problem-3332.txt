Does anyone have a good suggestion of a biography of Henry A Wallace? I recently watched a history show about the US from the start of WWII and on. It touched on Henry progressive stance and his vision of not a cold war but rather a industrial, commerce race between the US and the USSR. Id like to learn more and get your suggestions.
Stretching off from the Three Kingdoms a bit, you could also look at Mark Byinon's The Ancient State of Puyo in Northeast Asia, about a state that's at least conventionally strongly associated with the Korean kingdoms, and which goes into some pretty interesting history of ancient northeast Asia in general.
Hi! I’d love any recs re: late medieval religious culture, but am particularly fascinated with the stranger side of things, like the relationship between religion and practices of “magic” (conjuration, divination, astrology, necromancy, exorcism, etc—I know the meaning of some of these terms change over time). I’m also interested in knowing if they played any role in warfare, ie if the crown ever sought help from people who claimed to be adept in such practices for warfare/politics or if books of “magic” were intended more as entertainment.
A question that was made for me! Unfortunately there's no single overarching work that will cover everything in much depth--but if you're willing to wait 2 months, The Cambridge History of Korea will (hopefully) be out in late October, and the first volume of its 4 volumes is entirely dedicated to pre-Goryeo Korea, probably in as much depth as you could ever hope for.
