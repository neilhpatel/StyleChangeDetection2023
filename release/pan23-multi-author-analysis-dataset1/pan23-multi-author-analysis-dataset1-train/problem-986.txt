Bedbugs are notoriously hard to get rid of because they can survive up to a year between bites and they are amazing little hiders. They generally only come out at night unless you have an infestation. Order/buy bedbug mattress covers, they are the only way you will get rid of them. Sprays donâ€™t work unless you spray them directly. 120 degrees will kill them so put your stuff in the dryer for 20-30 mins. That will kill all life stages. A steamer works well for cracks if you have one.
Yeah again Ive lived here for around 2 years, the only "new" piece of large stuff I've brought with me are like 6 plastic containers full of legos which I use to teach kids, they are constantly sanitized due to covid restrictions and such, so Im sure there would be a hard time proving me guilty of having deliberately brought bedbugs into the unit, since again, there is always rotten furniture right outside my window.
But... this is all scientific. It's your landlords responsibility to prove that it's your fault. Saying 'It must have been you' and washing their hands of the situation should not hold up well.
