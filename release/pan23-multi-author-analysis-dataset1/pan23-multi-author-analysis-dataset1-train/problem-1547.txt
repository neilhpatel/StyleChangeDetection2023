I know that's not the law in the link, and that it was an opinion. It looked like opinion that matched up with what I was familiar with in past rental agreements. It's also talking about Georgia.
It is something to remember if you ever become a landlord though, but remember it's much easier for them to be accomdating if they have the man power or lack of jobs, but for most it's hard taking care of 100s of units with 100s of different people with different schedules etc so there has to be a point where they can just handle things how they need to.
Ok. If that's what the law says, then I guess it could make some sense. Still, were I running the property, I would want the tenant to be present during maintenance requests, if possible, and I would do my best to schedule things within times that work best for everyone. Maybe my opinion would change if I had to deal with a tenant like myself.
Non-emergency entry. If the landlord needs to enter the premises for a reason that is not considered an emergency, such as making routine repairs or conducting maintenance, he must give the tenant prior notice. The law does not specify how much notice is required, but 24 hours is considered reasonable and customary. General, non-emergency entry should take place during normal business hours from Monday to Friday unless the tenant otherwise agrees.
Oh! Sorry, I wouldn't say that it's, "whenever I prefer," so much as something that should not be unilateral either way. I have a leaky dishwasher, they want to replace it, and I would prefer to be around for the repair to keep everything on the up and up.
