Yeah, neither does the EU at large condemn the US for their own unjust wars. Just writes a sternly written letter and then happily joins and plunders the oil with the US. It's the same shit, except the Russian imperialist war endangers the EU, while the US' imperialist wars endanger other regions.
No. Even as an Indian who supports the oil deal this is a scenario that won't happen. The West has agreed to let India buy oil, But that doesn't mean they will accept India to mediate any discussions of peace. Mediating discussions of peace by India would mean silent aknowledgement that India buying Russian oil meant it was being a neutral party, Which the West would never agree to thus The West would prevent Ukraine from allowing India to host any peace talks.
Very true. I think few Americans think of India as friendly, but virtually everyone acknowledges that China is unfriendly. Those disposed toward kindness might call them an adversary; those more disposed toward reality would call them an enemy.
