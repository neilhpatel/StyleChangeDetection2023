I'm a librarian, but I'm going to talk about what are sometimes referred to as the LAM institutions: libraries, archives and museums. There is no such thing as "definitive" (I will leave it at that, I'm not a historiographer) but there are institutions that are "repositories." There are , (which the Library of Congress defines to include archival collections), numbered from 0 to 5. Many libraries collect certain subjects at level 4 ("a collection that includes the major published source materials required for dissertations and independent research") or 5 ("a collection which, so far as is reasonably possible, includes all significant works of recorded knowledge"). The Library of Congress is one, but there are many others around the US and the world, both run by the national governments of various states as well as by public and private universities. These subjects may be specific ( maintains a level 5 collection on American Quakerism), less specific (the University of Illinois maintains a level 5 collection on ) or extremely broad (the Library of Congress maintains a level 5 collection on the United States, and a level 4 collection on most other topics).
1000 was just a number. Obviously it’s never going to be everyone, but maybe it could be 10000 per country or something, who knows. You get what I’m getting at though.
Technology and education (particularly literacy) as well as changing worldviews have made preservation much easier and more common. You have organizations working to build collections about particular aspects of the modern day that never would have been preserved in the past. The Library of Congress was archiving every single Twitter post until a couple of years ago. You have digital spaces which make it easier for disenfranchised peoples to not only share their voice but also store it for future generations.
