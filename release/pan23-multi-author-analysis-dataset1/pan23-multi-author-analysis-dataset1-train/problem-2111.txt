The issue is that people may believe that but the American government would salivate at an opportunity like that. Early Ukraine invasion for people watching you could see disinformation spreading around saying that we shouldn’t interfere with Ukraine for whatever reason. It didn’t work, for the reason I just stated. The US government has consistently never given up an opportunity to poke around big competitors, irregardless of what the people may think. You’ll have to be more creative then this.
The problem is that the Indian government is using this argument as a convenient excuse to support a criminal, authoritarian regime, that doesn't do it's people nor the world any good when in reality there is no obligation at all what so ever, but only economic interest.
It is a word though, and it’s not some new slang. Does it make sense? Not necessarily, but there are plenty of words in the English language that don’t follow the set standard. It’s sure as hell not worth getting upset over, and I don’t think any opinion is absolute.
