They often boil and intermediate like sodium, which in turn boils water to supercritical temperatures. Not trying to be pedantic, just think it's kinda cool.
I understand that the point of reasearch reactor isn't to generate energy for consumption, but it's not obvious to me that fusion will ever be a commercially viable source of energy production, given the immense practical and technical problems of maintaining containment while feeding fuel and extracting energy. Of course, I would love it if artificially contained fusion was an easily exploitable energy source source, but I am afraid that may simply not be the case. In my view, this skeptical view does not get enough attention, given what is currently warranted by the evidence.
Fusion reactors are completely different technology then fission. If you think the general technological advancements that come with projects like these are dangerous and should be kept from spreading, your just a Luddite and should stop typing on your device and go churn some butter.
Really? My big worry is that goverments will start to see fusion as a climate change solution before contained fusion has actually been successfully demonstrated as a potential power source.
