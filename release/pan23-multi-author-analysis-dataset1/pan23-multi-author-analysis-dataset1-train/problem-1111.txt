In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I agree. And even though I would probably personally be better off with Republicans elected, I vote for Dems since the world I want is one where I don't have the advantages that I do and other people have the same rights I enjoy.
100% truth. I understand why parents and adults teach children that, because most children and most adults themselves are not warriors and don't have the psyche of a warrior. The average person lacks a killer instinct. Most people deal with bullies, abusers, stalkers, killers and other psychos by avoiding them or running away. But it's shit advice to deal with some people because some of the aforementioned scourges of society don't lose interest or give up when you ignore them or run away. Some of them it just encourages them to attack you harder. Like a predatory carnivorous animal smelling that it drew blood from its prey.
