If you'll take non-legal advice: it's really not worth, for your and his peace of mind, to be a "nervous wreck," "worried for his life," and to claim that a doctor not knowing what's causing the symptoms amounts to "extreme" worry by that doctor. I can guarantee that the doctor is very far from being "extremely worried." He may have a slight concern about the long term effectiveness of the booster, but that's very likely it. He's not going to die from an early dose, I promise. And his headache will recede soon. With the vast majority of vaccines, you can get a double or even triple dose and nothing bad will happen, other than perhaps enhanced side effects. He got his just a hair too soon, that's it.
The CDC currently has no recommendations regarding treatment or monitoring of individuals who received their second dose early. The symptoms he is having are consistent with those reported by individuals who have received the second dose within the appropriate timeframe, but you should have your husband call his primary care physician just to be sure.
