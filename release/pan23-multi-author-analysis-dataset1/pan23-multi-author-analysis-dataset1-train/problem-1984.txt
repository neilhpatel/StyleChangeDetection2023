You need to check whatever document you signed OP whether this was a holding fee for the landlord to not rent the apartment while you consider it or an actual security deposit.
Then its a security deposit, not a holding fee by the landlord's own admission and cannot legally keep it without a signed lease.
A hold unit fee is a pre-lease agreement where the landlord agrees not to sign a lease with someone else while the lease is negotiated. They do not count as a deposit and may be non-refundable. They can be moved as part or all of the deposit as part of the signed lease agreement. They also have to be an explicit contract, otherwise the courts will treat the money as a residential security deposit. I do not recommend paying these, they are usually nothing more than a runaround of California law banning non-refundable security deposits.
IANAL. That deposit is likely non-refundable. Most landlords require a fee to “hold your place” (think of it as collateral). That fee prevents them from allowing others to rent the unit until you either sign a lease, or relinquish your spot for said unit. With the latter (what you decided); the deposit is forfeited to the landlord as compensation for the time period where he/she was unable to advertise or rent the unit to another potential tenant.
A landlord should not be collecting a security deposit before a lease is signed, a rental application fee cannot legally cost more than $53.33, and I can’t find any information regarding the existence of a “hold unit” fee. Something is not adding up.
