You also have to show that they knowingly called to cause you harm or that they knew the house was not being broken into and called. If they had a reasonable fear, youâ€™re not likely to win.
It seems reasonable to talk to a local attorney to engage with the police to get the report and either 1) advise OP that there's no basis for action; 2) if the report was overblown, bring evidence to the DA to pursue a false report charge against the neighbors (and maybe a civil action, dunno, again IANAL); 3) depending on how the situation unfolded, possibly pursue a formal complaint with the police department for handcuffing Black house hunters in front of their eight-year-old child, something that likely speaks to a failure in judgment and training.
And this story sounds like something out of a TV show. You've included enough details (city, etc) to make it seem relevant and realistic, but nothing else. For example, which neighborhood were you in? Also, the whole thing doesn't make sense. You were handcuffed and hauled out to the front lawn, and then the real estate agent appears out of nowhere to explain everything to the police?
