The Making of Modern Lithuania by Tomas Balkelis. The revised version of his dissertation, he takes a different look from the traditional look at the formation of Lithuania. As such I'd read it with a inquiring mind, and take note of the sources he lists, especially in the first section where he reviews previous works. Balkelis has also done other work on Lithuania, which could be worth looking into (I'll mention War, Revolution, and Nation-Making in Lithuania, 1914-1923 which is something I personally would like to read at one point), but this was his first book (again I'll caution I have not read the book).
Hi there. I'm very interested in late medieval religious culture, especially where it intersects with magic and sexuality, so any recs there would be greatly appreciated. I'm also particularly interested in the idea of "holy knight," whether the fictional paladins of Charlemagne or the actual knights templar. Where can I read about the theological/sociopolitical contexts from which these sprang? Were there holy warriors outside of Christianity at the time, and where might I read about them? I so appreciate your suggestions--this has quickly become my favorite sub.
