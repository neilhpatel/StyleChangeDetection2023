The afternoon sun was bright - it seemed to always be bright in Egypt- and the pyramid's sides shone with painful intensity. The climbers, now almost to the top, were specks in a quivering expanse of white. Shadowing his eyes with his hands, the tourist tried to guess the route they would take to the top. He had heard, of course, that the villagers of Busiris would climb the pyramid for a fee, but actually seeing the men work their way up the face, following long cracks and fingerholds invisible from the ground - well, he would have paid much more than a few tetradrachms to see that. His guide pointed. "Look!" The first climber was on point of reaching the pyramid's top...
No topic in Egyptology has ignited more debate than the Amarna period, so a couple of books discuss the historiography and modern reception of Akhenaten and the Amarna period specifically.
It's okay, I just wondered. Thank you for answering. I know a lot of Latin names sound similar to one another. So "the Fabulae of pseudo-Hyginus" could also be interpreted as "Fabulae, a book dubiously attributed to Hyginus"?
Yes, that's exactly right. Without having checked recently, I'm assuming the situation is that the manuscripts attribute it to Hyginus, but there's reason to doubt that it's by the only well known Hyginus. Last time I looked, I know I was persuaded by the evidence that he wasn't the author -- but that was a few years ago now!
