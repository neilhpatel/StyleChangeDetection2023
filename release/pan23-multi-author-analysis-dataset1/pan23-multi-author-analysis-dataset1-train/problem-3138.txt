It does not workout that way for everyone. It will depend a lot on the loan amount and the interest rate. Most people also have an escrow payment built into their mortgage which you aren’t accounting for (perhaps another issue). The best way to figure out what goes towards the principal is for the OP to actually look at the mortgage statements.
When you first take out a mortgage, the majority of your payment goes towards interest. Very little of it goes towards reduction of the principal. You are not paying $1200 per month towards the equity, so even under that theory, you will not be entitled to the entire amount back, and in fact probably less than what is being offered. Look at the mortgage statements, and you will see the breakdown of how much actually goes towards the principal. Equity is the fair market value minus the mortgage and any other liens. All other things being equal (the value is usually around the purchase price when the time period is that short unless strange circumstances exist), it is very unlikely that your payments reduced the principal balance by even the $3,000 that he’s offering let alone the $6,000 you want.
Hi. You can find the answer to this question above. Also, I'd like to thank you for the very detailed explanation on your original comment, I really appreciate your input.
