Yeah, I have absolutely no conception of economics at all. You could explain it a thousand times and my brain will refuse to absorb the information.
I think you either didn't read the article or missed the entire paragraph showing the relative difference: "Monthly tax and customs revenue from energy sales declined 46% in a year - reflecting the fact that, while the price of the global benchmark Brent blend was little changed, the average monthly price of Russia's Urals blend was down 42%, according to the ministry.".
I'm gonna nitpick and say that the price of light sweet crude oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, US, went negative in 2020 for the delivery of a monthly futures contract due to local storage and transportation constraints combined with low demand, but Brent Crude and Russian Urals never went negative.
I actually watch all of his videos. Even some of his gaming ones, lol. The Terra Invicta ones are good. At 2x speed due to time constraints. I get most of what he says, I just don't know what it really means to be 'screwed' economically. As in, what does that mean for the Russian people in general? The US economy was absolutely fucked during The Great Depression, but we bounced back hard.
