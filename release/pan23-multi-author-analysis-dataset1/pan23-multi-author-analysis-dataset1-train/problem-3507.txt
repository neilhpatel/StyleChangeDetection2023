says "[Muskets] were also tested for armor piercing capacity. Shot from a variety of weapons penetrated mild steel an average 2.7 mm (about 11 gauge) at 30 meters, or 2 mm (12.5 gauge) at 100 meters. One of the pistols was fired a ta distance of 8.5 meters at a breastplate made in Augsburg around 1570, made of cold worked steel 2.8-3mm thick,or about 8.5 gauge. The breastplate was mounted on a sandbag covered in 2 layers of linen, to simulate an undershirt. Surprisingly, the bullet pierced the breastplate, but not the linen ! The bullet dissipated its force piercing the plate, and didn’t even generate metal splinters. However, a modern 3 mm steel plate lined with linen didn’t fare so well".

I think the original answer might be drawing on some dated scholarship that overstates the 'unwillingness' of both the Ming and Qing dynasties to 'advance', and possibly over-emphasizes the superiority of the arquebus (which I have to imagine comes from the Japanese context, and wasn't at all helped by authors like Noel Perrin pushing extreme claims about how many hundreds of thousands of arquebuses were in Japan, and how they later supposedly dominated the battlefield in the Imjin War).
