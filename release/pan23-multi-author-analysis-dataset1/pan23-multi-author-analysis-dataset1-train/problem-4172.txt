I agree. I've read all the articles posted with a completely open mind, and, unfortunately, these articles are kinda all over the place and very shortsighted. I would enjoy learning about studies on this therapy 15-20 years from now.
The idea that certain topics aren't deserving legislative action and instead should be relegated to the professionals who've dedicated their lives to the study of such topics and those individuals whose lives are directly impacted by those topics is laid by the wayside is apparently not a 'hot take' by these randos who have a fly-by-night 'my feels' definitive opinion that should impact legislation. Fuckin a, man. Chill on the culture war shit. It's not what's ruining your life.
"These studies go against my biases, so I'm going to demand even LONGER studies that are even more RIGOROUS And when they turn out to be against my biases, I'll demand EVEN LONGER AND MORE RIGOROUS TESTING 100 years from now after all the studies thoroughly refuted me and when all the trans people that were denied the care they needed are dead I will no longer need to concern myself with the question for it will be moot.".
