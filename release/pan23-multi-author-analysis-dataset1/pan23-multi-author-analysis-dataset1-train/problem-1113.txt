He’s not right about the taxes either. Texas has no income tax but some of the highest property taxes, sales taxes, and fees that I’ve ever paid anywhere and because none of that is progressively taxed like income it nets out to being a regressive tax structure.
Indeed. But don't you find it a tad invasive? Motherfuckin' texans can't stomach a fuckin' gun law but they're ok with 6/7 days liquor freedom. Got it /s.
And indoctrinating far right, christian nationalist beliefs and ideologies. Programing kids at a young age. Those schools will stop teaching history. Stop teaching foreign language. Start teaching hatred and beliefs that otherness is dangerous. Instilling fear. Finally- a society of clueless people who won’t know how to function in the real world with decency and equality. Ultimately it will lead to more and more people by age 18, willing to fight for their leader Abbott-take arms-war etc.
