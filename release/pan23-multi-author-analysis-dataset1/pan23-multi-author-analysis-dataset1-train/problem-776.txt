Nextdoor in my Anchorage suburb is a mixture of conservatives saying fsck ranked choice voting and they can't believe how votes are just "magically" being reallocated to other candidates, and to just vote for 1 candidate in the future to somehow "out vote this nonsense", and rational people trying to educate them on how that means they are throwing their vote away. Love it.

Literally. Conservatives got humiliated in the Revolutionary War, again in the Civil War, they lost with civil rights and Roe vs Wade, they lost with their attempted MAGA republican coup, so they’re trying to “make america great again” by sticking it to the libs with their culture wars.
I'm not. I've got a beautiful house with a million dollar view (literally). My neighbors are great people, and nobody bothers me. I get this a lot from people that I expect come from "trendier" places in Alaska, or have never been to Alaska at all and just go off whatever narrative they read online. Like "eww there are churches and republican voters there, how do you exist?!".
