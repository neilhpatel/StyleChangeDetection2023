"Knowingly indicates that the defendant is aware of the nature of the act and its probable consequences (Utah Code Ann., 2011). Knowingly differs from purposely in that the defendant is not acting to cause a certain result but is acting with the awareness that the result is practically certain to occur (State v. Huff, 2011). The Model Penal Code describes knowingly as follows: “A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when…he is aware that his conduct is of that nature…if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result” (Model Penal Code in § 2.02(2) (b)).
Your issue is not with the cop. He did his job based on information in his system. I know this charge is scary, but this seriously starts with a visit to the DMV. All of your documents are extra bonuses, but you absolutely need to go to the DMV immediately and simply ask them what they see in their system. They are the ones with the answers. I still don’t know why you haven’t gone to the DMV yet?
