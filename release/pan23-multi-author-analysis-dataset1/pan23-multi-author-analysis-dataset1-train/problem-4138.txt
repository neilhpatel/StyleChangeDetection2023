The Uighers are part of China's recognized minority groups. They're not trying to erase them, China's policies are based on the elimination of separatism and elimination of Islamic society in China that cannot be monitored and controlled by the state. In a way, China is trying to pacify the Uighers by assimilating them into Chinese society like the Hui Muslims have been. In fact the have tensions between their communities despite both of them being Muslim, and the Chinese state favors the Hui over Uighers. The education camps, suppression of religious expression, the forced teaching of Mandarin, everything is geared towards ensuring that the Uighers will submit to the state.
