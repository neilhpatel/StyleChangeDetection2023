EDIT/ To elaborate, so as not to come as off drive-by posting, even though it's probably obvious to you: for example it tries to downplay the disease and overplay it at the same time for the purpose of maximizing the genocide. For example, it tries to state that disease didn't spread outside Florida mission (so what happened to Cahokia?), and at the same time claims 95% population loss in NA. While in the same thread there are concrete figures for an area we have much better grasp of (as population figures for NA are and will always remain guessestimates) have 90% loss for Cuba during XVI century.
How? I clearly state that disease did play a role and that they results in higher mortality rates. It is hard to downplay the overwhelming dominant narrative this is as many scholars have been pushing it since Manifest Destiny deemed it necessary to have an explanation for where Natives were going that didn't reveal the horrors of colonization. You're literally just affirming the existing narrative, not pointing out any fault of mine for downplaying it.
