It's shitty bc it is either still using pistol caliber ammunition, or if it was designed to use rifle cartridges, then the barrel lenh is way out of sync with the specs that rifle cartridges are designed for which ruins accuracy, energy, and can make bullets hit things backwards, sideways, and miss.
Yes, yes. Laws don’t prevent crime. Let’s abolish everything… Says the “party of law and order”. Also let’s outlaw abortion so people won’t do it. These arguments sure are sensible.
TL;DR: To benefit from a rifle form factor, 3 things need to happen: 1) it needs to shoot rifle cartridges 2) the barrel lenh needs to be rifle lenh because that's what rifled cartridges are designed for 3) the twist rate of the barrel rifling needs to make the bullet spin at the right number of revolutions that the cartridge was designed for. Since adding a brace doesn't affect any of those things, braces should not be of any concern.
