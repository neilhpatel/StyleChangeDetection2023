Bro every war and Invasion US started was a business, this one you didnt started but its good for you for the reasons i said, i mean its logic, its good for you if Russia doesnt fulfill their goals, as for weapons corporations in US, they are big deal of your politics because they are the ones funding campaigns for your politicans, they are maybe the biggest reason why you invaded Iraq, Afghanistan or any other country, war is business.
