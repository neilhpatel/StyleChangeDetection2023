He was discriminated against by the company because they did not accommodate him for his disability the first time he asked and they're aware of his disabilities from his FMLA paperwork the year before. While the EEOC is investigating his case, they sent an offer for reasonable accommodation for this second time he asked. In their offer, they wrote the statement, "At no time, unless it is your supervisor, should you contact company staff for personal business." I asked them to clarify it. They responded with, "Your interaction with staff should be business related. For example, you might need to ask someone for clarification concerning a request received at the Help Desk. Should you need to discuss personal matters, you should do so with your supervisor or HR.".
Prohibiting fraternization between employees but allowing employees to disclose personal information to supervisors is discriminatory, but it's not unlawful - there's no law that it violates.
Oh? How so? The position isn’t anything where they’d talk about sensitive information. It’s more because the employee has a legal case against them while still employed there.
