As an explanation for this, it is crucial to keep in mind that the Nazi political leadership was massively influenced by the experience of collapse and capitulation in 1918, and was commensurately motivated by the desire to make sure that didn’t happen again. There are a multitude of examples – the SS’s original purpose, overlapping with its mission as a Party bodyguard, was to serve as a body capable of quickly crushing a 1918-esque revolution, to note just one – but the overall point most relevant to your question is that, at the highest level, the Nazi leadership was keen to ensure that civilian life was cared for to the fullest extent permissible by the war effort, so as to help prevent an uprising like the one that ended the German war effort in 1918. The “stab in the back myth” is fairly familiar, but in the context of your question, the antisemitic and anti-liberal elements are secondary to the point that the home front did in fact rise up and made it impossible for Germany to continue that war. Hitler in particular, and to a lesser degree his various subordinates, were haunted by that and went to extreme lenhs to ensure it could not happen again. (They succeeded.) This was why the leadership insisted on keeping civilian comforts and, where possible, the ordinary functions and ceremonies and window dressing of the state functional until it was no longer physically possible.
Thanks for your answer! That does make more sense, in terms of how institutions develop. I hadn’t realized that the SS had evolved into such a distinct organization, for example.
