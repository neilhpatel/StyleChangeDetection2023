You're the one making an assumption which isn't in line with OPs description and is \also\ made without a lease to go off of. So what were you saying about safe assumptions?
As others have already suggested you need to look at your lease and find out whether it indicates that you and other tenant are renting the whole place with a shared lease and have “exclusive use” of it minus the one bedroom, or whether you are each renting a room and can use the common areas in addition to your respective bedrooms.
No, you are not. In CA there can only be a single lodger in a house; if a landlord rents out multiple rooms, you are a normal tenant.
If the lease doesn’t define the common spaces, it should be all of the house besides the bedrooms (and any en suite bathrooms).
You may be mistaking this for the fact that you only have sole control over a single room, while the rest of the house (aside from the other bedrooms or other areas defined in your lease) are shared common areas.
OP appears to be only renting a room (and the other tenant is renting another room), which makes the rest of the space common areas. Landlords do not need to give notice to enter common areas.
