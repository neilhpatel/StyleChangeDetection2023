There is a lot missing here. What happened in the heated argument? Was what happened in the argument what was reported to the police?
If what happened in the argument was what was reported to the police this is not slander. Slander is where someone knowingly makes false statements of fact to tey and cause damages to you. If they reported they felt threatened by you in police report that is not slander as it is their opinion of the situation, but had they said OP said theyd kill me and you didnt say that it may be ruled slander. But context would matter a lot.
All the lawyers that I talked to and I don’t kno if they was being nice or what stated that of o wasn’t in law enforcement it would have never got this far and would have been tossed due to lack of evidence and the fact that witness state I never did what the other party was accusing me of.
You need to step back and look at the bigger picture. I dont think I need to tell you just how bad people view the police. There have been countless protests, riots and property damage as a result of what the public views as a racial police problem. There are cases where the officers actions are completely justified under the law and based on the situation but the public will still side with the individual. To them it is very important to make sure the best officers are on staff and interacting with the public. If you lost your cool with some drunk person shooting off at the mouth what are you going to do at a traffic stop with your service firearm on you?
