Of course, after having ordered the machine-gunners withdrawn following the browbeating, the PM suddenly was assaulted by people asking for them to return! Sir James Mitchell, Premier of Western Australia, was insistent that the campaign continue. Major Meredith, his pride at stake, wrote a very puffed up report that only added to the hilarity of the matter, writing of the Emus as some noble opponent to explain the fairly low ratio of kills to ammunition shot:
The final report tried to salvage some pride, nothing that although only "986" emus had been killed, roughly 5 percent of the reported number, Meredith claimed 2,500 had died later of their wounds, with no substantiation for this claim. Some 10,000 rounds of ammunition had been fired, and the cost was covered by the wheat-growers and other settlers in the region (or rather, the Agricultural Bank paid it and put liens on their farms). The eradication of course had not been all that successful, and the emus eventually left on their own accord to continue their migration. Similar migrations happened a few times over the next decade, but the farmers were basically left to deal with it themselves, although in 1943 they were given free ammunition from stockpiles deemed no longer likely to be used against a Japanese invasion.
I’m Australian. I’ve seen soldiers with emu plumes in their hats all my life, and have family photographs dating back through every Australian conflict all the way to the Boer War that show the same.
