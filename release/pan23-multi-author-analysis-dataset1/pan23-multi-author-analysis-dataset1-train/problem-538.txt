If it went down like the OP said the current business may have broken the law. But if its like you are thinking, they said I am not allowed to verify that then thats different. Getting it in writing from both sides will clear it up.
If OP says he works there, and Manager says no one by that name has ever worked here, that makes OP a liar and someone potentially trying to defraud the hiring company by trying to gain employment by deceiving them about his credentials (or completely delusional).
1. First send an email, or had copy via regular mail with a copy via email, of a letter with copies of W2s and a few paystubs to the new employer or background investigation company to show the information they received was not accurate. You say you told the new employer you had this information but I think it would be better if you provided the information in writing to them so they have proof in hand rather than just a verbal indication.
3. If for some reason you donâ€™t get the gig. Obtain a letter explaining why or get it in writing at the very least so you can pursue a claim against your current boss and company. They will likely have some sort of negligence.
