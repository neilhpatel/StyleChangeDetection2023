In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I like this. I'd offer "ðŸ˜–" vs. "Eff you, I can do whatever I want and if you question me, I'll shoot you in the face and get away with it because I'm amazing and everyone is just jealous... Has anyone seen my crayons?" (Addendum - his big box of crayons come in two colors - redacted black and pretentious gold).
One lied, denied having classified documents, got caught in possession of boxes of them, lied and claimed they had all been returned, got caught with hundreds more, put a janky padlock on the closet where they were stored, threw a tantrum about the execution of a search warrant, lied about psychically declassifying them, all while a parade of randos and dodgy foreigners circulated and infiltrated throughout MAGA Lardo unsupervised for months.
