It's not a life estate if it ends when the sister moves out. Its a defeasible fee simple. How favorable that is to the OP depends very heavily on the specific language of the grant.
The OP is really going to need to take the specific language of the grant to an attorney to have them review it. If the OP disclaims the inheritance they get nothing. Making a threat that they will disclaim without fully understanding what interest they are entitled to in the land is a great way to turn something that might have some future benefit for the OP into the sister just being given everything.
Not at all. Remainder beneficiaries have no obligation to do anything. Being a remainder beneficiary entails nothing at all except owning a house free and clear when the life tenant dies.
If the deal is that she is the life tenant with obligations to maintain the property and when she dies you get it, then there isn't much reason to disclaim.
If the deal instead is that you immediately become the owner of the property with all obligations to maintain it, pay tax, pay insurance, pay utilities, etc. but she gets to live there rent free for 20-50 years until she dies, then you might want to disclaim, especially if this is an older property that isn't worth much. You maintenance costs may exceed any value of your right to eventually sell the property when she moves out or passes away.
