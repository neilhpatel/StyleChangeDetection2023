There were concerns Microsoft is building cloud gaming monopoly. Microsoft and nvidia made a deal regarding that.
What happened was the verdict was overturned on appeal, because the original judge broke ethical guidelines during the trial by commenting about it publicly on TV, and the new administration washed their hands of the affair - because they rightly realized that they had no way to win, because due to the highly public nature of the trial there was no longer anyone untainted by the original trial.
Ah right. If there's anything Microsoft is known for its producing great games. I mean, look at Halo, Gears, Fable, all of Rares IPs. None of them have fallen apart over the years.
The only real enduring outcome of that trial was a general lack of desire to have such public egg-on-face moments from the DOJ, which is why antitrust enforcement since has been seriously anemic, and a significant increase to corporate lobbying flows from the tech sector.
Wow how generous. Let us know when they offer those titles without the caveat of allowing GP to dominate the entire market unabated. There's a reason they were only offering it on GP and not just allowing it on the PS store which Sony has no issue with (see: The Outer Worlds and Minecraft).
They said no to MS games being offered on PS as GP exclusives. They've had zero issue allowing MS games on PS through the store (Outer Worlds and Minecraft).
