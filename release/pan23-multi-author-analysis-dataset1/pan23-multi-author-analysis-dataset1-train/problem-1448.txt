INAL. It sounds like your tenant never changed the electric to their name because they owe the electric company money. And yes, it appears that you have been scammed by your tenant. I usually recommend to LL's as someone who has worked for utility companies is to put it in writing that any utilities will need to be put in the tenants name within 48 hours of the tenant moving in. This way you are not held liable for the tenant not doing the right thing. Electric, gas, water, trash, etc. should be in the tenants name right away. And if they balk at it, you can tell them that it is their choice to rent from you or not. If so, then that's what they need to do.
Here is my question though, they where supposed to assume the electric and put it in their name, I could have turned the electric off my name the 1st month and it would have been their responsibility, but now bc I was nice, was scammed, and now a victim, I no longer have the right to take it off my name? I'm not blocking them from putting it in their name. What the hell could be done to encourage anti social people to ever put it in their name then? Bc these people absolutely would never do the right thing and put it in their name if they aren't forced to.
