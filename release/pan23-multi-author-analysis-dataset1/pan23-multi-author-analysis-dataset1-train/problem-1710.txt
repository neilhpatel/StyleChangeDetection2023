Hi! As this question pertains to basic, underlying facts of the Holocaust, I hope you can appreciate that it can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we want people to get the answers they are looking for, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of response. As such, this message is not intended to provide you with all of the answers, but simply to address some of the basic facts, as well as Holocaust Denial, and provide a short list of introductory reading. There is always more than can be said, but we hope this is a good starting point for you.
Ultimately, let logic help: which sounds more plausible, a horrible fascist government set about the systematic genocide of a race of people, leaving us many detailed primary documents OR a conspiracy was entered into by half the known world to discredit this fascist nation, leaving no physical evidence, and, whilst being powerful enough to pull off this conspiracy, still be stupid enough to be caught by internet warriors decades later?
