Let's start with some of the reasons why rationing existed. First, despite the United States being mostly self sufficient throughout the war, in some areas it wasn't. One oft-forgotten bit of the early part of the war was that it wasn't just military materiel like natural rubber that had become rare; palm and many other common frying oils of the time had been lost when the Japanese conquered large parts of Asia, and the U-Boat campaign reigned utter havoc on the main supply of sugar to the United States from Cuba.
Awesome anecdote, thank you. I have to ask, in regards to the Zoot Suit riots, I'm a little confused as to the actual source of anger here (vis-a-vis the rationing, I'm clear on the racism). So, Navy guys wanted the Mexican zoot suit wearers to keep the suits in their closets, as it was seen as in poor taste to wear them outdoors during a period of austerity? Or was the idea that they had bought their suits on the black market? Or were they supposed to donate their suits...?
This dovetailed with the massive effort made between government and the private sector to promote the efficacy and importance of rationing; this is where basic food groups developed for what was considered basic nutritional needs, where alternates were suggested for recipes, reuse of products considered, and where advertisements in magazines urged housewives to do their share with every last meal preparation. The social pressure to conform was immense, but it wasn't just that; as government issued coupons, it now became a crime to misuse them, something that even Justice William O. Douglas - later known for often obstinate protest against potential government overreach on civil liberties - authored a 1946 opinion in Davis v. United States upholding the conviction of someone who refused to turn over hundred of gasoline ration coupons for resale precisely because they were government issued.
