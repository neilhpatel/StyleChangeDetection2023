i think that for now, this is just posturing. China doesn't want to invade Taiwan this year or the next. If they ever feel like they have the clear military advantage (say in 5 years) then yeah it could happen. But i doubt they want to get in a stupid situation like Russia.
Military advantage, and ability to conduct a successful amphibious assault and establishment of a beachhead after crossing a vast expanse of open water are another thing entirely.
lol me too. From what I've read over the years, China appears to be trying alternative methods a lot. They try to open backdoors into Taiwanese government, constantly flying planes to "buzz" the Taiwanese air force, and try to eliminate distinction between China and Taiwanese culture.
3. China takes Taiwan but the US destroys chip facilities - US still gets preferential access to advanced chips from the only other source, SK. Otherwise, China and US are producing similarly advanced chips.
Wouldn't surprise me if the US destroys those semiconductor facilities instead of letting them fall into Chinese hands.
