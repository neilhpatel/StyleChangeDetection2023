Estonia, which is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), is considering the possibility of effectively blocking the passage of Russian ships through the Baltic Sea. Estonia's introduction of a so-called contiguous zone, which can be up to 12 nautical miles from the 12-mile territorial sea, allows the country to conduct searches in the Gulf of Finland on military ships and civilian vessels to monitor compliance with Estonian law.
Don't believe this. They are not going to try to blockade the Baltic. They want to do inspections to enforce sanctions, but I doubt they'll get away with that. Even if they tried, the first Russian ship that gets hit by the Blue Spears noted in this article will result in Estonia getting flattened and the likely the rest of the world right after. I don't mean this as an insult on Estonia, they have heart and appreciable desire to stick it to the Russians. It's just an absurdly stupid idea.
Since no insurance company on the planet is currently writing policies for Russian cargo ships and they are being indemnified by China and India, this will trigger a payout of the insurance policy if Estonia never releases the ship from impound, which will mean those countries will likely stop indemnifying Russian cargo ships, and now Russian vessels can't dock at a port anywhere on the planet other than Russia.
Yeah, me too. The whole street outside was full of riot fences and posters of bombed Ukrainians. The contrast with the Swedish embassy's little Christmas tree across the street was interesting...
