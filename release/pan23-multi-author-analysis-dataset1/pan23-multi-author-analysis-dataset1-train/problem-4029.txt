Yea see, I just can't get into this "horror" movie, the scary monster is just too over the top silly. It's a balloon.
It's a balloon! It goes where the wind takes it. That's how the technology works. Oh my gosh this is disheartening how absolutely dumb the conservative party has become. I'm ashamed.
The official statement from Chinaâ€™s foreign ministry mentions specifically they will continue communication with their US counterparts.
Why can't a high-power laser be used? There are consumer-grade blue lasers that can pop balloons from a pretty significant range with relative ease. I'd imagine the government has significantly higher-power devices available- capable of doing the same thing from much further away and the cost of operating a laser would likely be much cheaper than sending multi-million dollar missiles at them.
Same thought. Related to that is simply pushing the limits to see where the limit is. Like, they didn't shoot down a surveillance balloon at 60,000 feet, will they shoot one down at 50,000? No, let's try 30,000, etc...
