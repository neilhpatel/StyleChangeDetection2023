When the annual conscription decrees were drawn up by the Council of State the quota of recruits for each regiment would be assigned to certain departments; these departments could be widely spread throughout France, in 1806 for example the 70th Ligne drew 500 conscripts from 4 different departments:
Cavalry regiments, the young guard and the artillery had their quotas widely spread throughout France - an extreme example from the same year was the 2nd Dragoons who drew 200 men from 16 different departments, though all were clustered in the North-West of France. Each regiment had a Recruitment Captain (capitaine de recrutement) who would reside in the departmental capital from where most of the regiments men would be drawn. When conscription draws were conducted he would be joined by a number of Lieutenants and Sous-Lieutenants who would be stationed in each arrondissement of the department in order to choose the regiment's recruits and ensure they were conducted safely to the regimental depot, assisted by a number of NCOs.
I'm very insanely surprised myself at the details. I have ancestors who were in the American Civil War who I have less detail on. I can get down to battalion and company level as well, it's wonderful.
