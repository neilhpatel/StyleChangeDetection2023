So which state is its "master", that it cannot act against if they disagree? What other nations are the citizens of Israel, especially those who have been born and raised as Israelis, automatically citizens of? Treating it as a colonial outpost in the modern day is no different from treating Taiwan/the Republic of China as one. They're both countries that were formed in the aftermath of WWII due to an intersection of local and global politics but have acted independently of the entities surrounding them for over 70 years now, making any treatment of them as non-sovereign entities fucking idiotic. Hell, the modern state of Ukraine is just over 30 years old and is very much not the Ukraine that existed before the USSR given all that occurred during the USSR's time, yet the only ones questioning its established borders and treating it as a subservient entity are Russia and Russia's immediate allies.
I am quite sure its well known. However, put yourselves in our shoes. To us, Israel is more of a colonial outpost, as a proxy state; rather than an actual Jewish haven. There was recorded co-existence of both Jews living with Muslims.
Jewish people have a right to a peaceful co existence. But Israel does not have a right to force bullshit down our throats.
