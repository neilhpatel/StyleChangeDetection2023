However, in all this I have left out the "Johannine" writings: the gospel, epistles, and apocalypse all attributed to St John. These books and their relationship to one another are disputed, but many would suggest they are products of a "school" that has its roots in their reputed author, John the Apostle. The Gospel of John and 1 John were accepted earliest; at the other end, Revelation was one of a number of Christian apocalypses circulating in the early Church, distinguishing itself perhaps most by its compelling literary construction and compatibility with the rest of the New Testament.
It’s also a strategic choice. Plenty of people believe you can argue against the harmful parts of these books without throwing them out and choose to do so. It helps with their own ability to communicate to the widest possible audiences, but they might also find other parts of these texts worth keeping. And there might still be some reverence for the canon — it’s not our job to excise parts of the canon just because we don’t like it. Once you open that door, it can be problematic. The Marcion example is one that I’ve heard reflected upon: an issue he had with the texts was the Jewish aspects. We might do it to make a more egalitarian vision, but others will do the exact opposite. Instead, choosing to keep these texts as authoritative makes it easier for opposing views to debate because they’re all using the same basic text to argue their point.
