Without the generic "CRT" label, the right would need to rile people up for each instance. They might be successful with some topics, but not all. With CRT, though, they've trained their base to dislike anything that's called CRT. Then, all they need to do is say "this thing is CRT" and their base gets riled up.
The right stripped CRT of any meaning so that it could be used against as many things as possible. Did a school tell kids that white slave owners bought and sold black people as property? That's CRT now. Did a teacher mention the Fugitive Slave Act and the Underground Railroad? It's CRT. Did an economics teacher mention redlining laws? CRT!
According to capitalistic ideals that conservatives (supposedly) prioritize, businesses "going woke" is precisely what "the market deciding for itself" actually looks like in the wild.
I kind of admire the efficiency of it. With one short, easy-to-remember term, they can label themselves as every type of detestable bigot at once. Itâ€™s a real time-saver.
