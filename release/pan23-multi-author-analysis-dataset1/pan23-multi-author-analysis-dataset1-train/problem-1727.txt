At the time, it was a compromise to end a war and find a solution that could satisfy everyone. One century later, it had become insufferable. The English kings became more and more reluctant to uphold their duties regarding their liege, especially regarding all things related to fealty, allegiance and oaths. They dodged convocations, pretexted sickness, etc. They did not want to swear any kind of oath and did so reluctantly when there was no other choice. Philippe V of France had to wait two years for any oath, and it was not said in person but by representatives. Edouard II of England only accepted to come himself one year later, and only because his county of Ponthieu was occupied by French administrators until he would come and swear in person. The French kings were not better: quick to try and erode their vassalsâ€™ rights and prerogatives, uncompromising when it came to punishing offenses (real or amplified) from the local population against the rest of the kingdom, happy to sow discontent among the local nobility and to take advantage of their divisions and their bitterness about the English kings.
The Magna Carta you mentionned is a prime exemple of the other way around : King John is in a tough spot, contested by his barons and not able to resist them, and he is kind of "forced" to sign a document limiting his authority, as far as I know (but, again, I'm more focused on France and 200 years later).
Again not sure this makes sense. But...it not being technically a nation seems...tangential to a lot of the problems?
