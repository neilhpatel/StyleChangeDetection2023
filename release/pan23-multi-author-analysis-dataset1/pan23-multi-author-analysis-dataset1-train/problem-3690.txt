I did some of the prep work with the speakers on 2 of these panels and was blown away by the abstracts they submitted and the check in about how close their papers stayed to the submission. A lot of incredible history happening here and I finally get to see the full lenh discussions This will be a fantastic week!
Really interesting subjects. Can't wait for the rest! I was wondering if the keynote address will also be made available for viewing after its live transmission? 11 AM ET is the middle of the night where I am.
And of course, a huge thank you to all the organisers, the speakers, and the wonderful AskHistorians community and large for making this conference possible As a layman with no formal history training, I appreciate the effort made to make historical research accessible to the rest of us, and I look forward to the coming panels and keynote.
Awesome! Even from just the first few minutes of each, I can tell these are really well put together, and I'm looking forward to hearing everybody expand on them tomorrow.
