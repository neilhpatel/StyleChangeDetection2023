EMT/Paramedic training in my state VA as of 2011 taught us to ignore tattoos for the reasons listed above. We only look out for medical tags. Which could be on bracelets or dog tags.
It probably won't help you initially bc emergency responders operate under the "reasonable person" assumption that most reasonable people would want life-saving measures provided in an emergency, but once they ID you at a hospital where you have a DNR, they will have follow that order.
Check out . They make and sell bracelets for runners, people with medical conditions, etc. EMT’s and hospitals do look for them (from personal experience) There is an option to engrave whatever you want on the plate, but you can also opt for the interactive version. Mine has my name and stuff on it, but it also has the website and a PIN code on the back. If an EMT or ER type those numbers into theiir computers, your entire medical history or whatever you want them to know pops up. It is totally customizable, the company is great, and it would be way cooler than a tattoo that may or may not be visible. Just an option to check out.
Nah dude I’m not upset or anything—I only looked it up because a) I was curious about the actual law and b) if I’d previously misunderstood/been taught incorrectly, that could lead to patient harm and/or legal liability. I owe it to my patients to know exactly what the correct thing to do is. We’re good!
