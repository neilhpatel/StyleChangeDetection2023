critics have never been monolithic. In the case of The Empire Strikes Back, the bloc of haters wasn't.
Most notably IMO, SW takes time to allow us to get to know the characters individually before they are mixed together: we have an extended scene with Luke and his uncle and aunt where we learn some things about his character; the droids have their own extended scene so that we learn about their characters; Han has a shorter scene, but it does a good job (especially the OV) of setting him up as the amoral petty criminal.

There are more abbreviated expositions for Leia and Darth; Leia is basically an archetype without an independent personality (plucky princess in trouble) until after she meets and interacts with the other characters; Darth's exposition basically shows him as a powerful and evil villain, which remains unchanged throughout the film.
Iâ€™d argue it was more of a return to the past of serials. As I understand it, previous generations of westerns and other genres were frequently serialized in books, films and on radio.
