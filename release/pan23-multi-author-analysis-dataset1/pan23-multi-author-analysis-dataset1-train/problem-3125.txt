You are somehow assuming its easier to bot-flood a social media network than it is to have your PR people call up a cable news company in order to get good press. Without twitter all you'd see was good news in the press about climate stuff, which not coincidentally is what tended to dominate coverage of these types of conferences before social media made it easier for scientists to speak directly to people.

Totally incorrect. For one thing, this has literally never happened on Twitter with environmental issues. Every single environmental conference gets criticized for this.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
