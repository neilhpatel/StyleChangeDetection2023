This is getting to be like the monkey see, monkey do antics on tik-tok--even though there is absolutely no connection between paintings in museums and global warming, it's become a fad to toss soup on paintings as if the average person would even understand the connection, let alone empathize or take action based on this. It reeks of out of touch coddled Western ignorance.

Nope. Not a sinle piece of art was actually damaged. They're mostly covered with glass and the ones that aren't they just glued themselves to the frame. The frames are just random frames. They aren't related to the art in them. Look it up. I cant believe it's taken 3 days to explain this 😔.
I'm just making the point that I think these demonstrations are also making, that being that people value things too much (such as the extravagance and excess that goes into art auctions) and that while I personally love art and love producing art (perhaps more than anything in the world), it's still inherently less valuable than the world and the things living on it. We can have people without art but we can't have art without people.
