For example, suppose President Allen (elected in 2024 and serving a term ending January 2029) pardons Baker on his last day in office, writing, “I now grant a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Baker for all offenses against the United States which Baker has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 2025 through January 19, 2029.”.

As some of the other comments pointed out accepting a pardon doesn't necessarily translate to admitting guilt for every specific element of a crime and some pardons are in anticipation of charges - such as President Ford pardoning President Nixon. As a prosecutor I don't see how that information is likely to help you prove the elements of a state crime. I could be wrong in some situations, but I think this is likely true in most cases. It's also something that is very rare to ever come up - presidential pardons are rare to begin with, and then having a state pursue charges for something similar is even more rare.
Practically no, prosecutors would not use evidence of the federal pardon in the state case. But, you're missing some important details with how this works as a separation of powers issue. Presidential pardons are only for federal crimes, the president cannot pardon someone for a state crime. There are many crimes on the books that are same or very similar at the state or federal levels though. What is happening in this case is the prosecutors in New York are charging the person with a New York state crime. The New York prosecutors still have to be able to prove every element of the NY state crime.
