Realistically I would see Mongolia getting a piece, China getting a piece, Georgia getting a piece, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, maybe even turkey getting a piece, Finland possibly, Estonia, Latvia, Belarus, and then likely a large or multiple semi larger partially autonomous states, they would lack industry and other things but it could work in theory.
Refugees tend to be grateful. Some (large) % aren’t. But they get super pissed off when inevitably their kids grow up to argue with them about politics and backwards-thinking, as fully-integrated Canadians.
But their kids grow up here and become indistinguishable from any other Canadian... which is to say indistinguishable from all the various cultures, languages, etc that we combine into Canada under the umbrella of calling ourselves Canadian and taking part in Canada's future.
Definitely. The only way I could think would be thru the Bering strait but that’s exactly what the u.s and Canada would expect, and they’d still would have too invade a part of the u.s first.
