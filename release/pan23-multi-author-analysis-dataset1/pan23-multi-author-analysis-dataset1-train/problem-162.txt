Thirdly, even if Ukraine was joining NATO, it is a wholly illogical reason for Russia to invade the country. NATO is a defensive alliance that deters Russian invasions. By this very logic: Russia only has invaded Ukraine to ensure that it can maintain potential control over the country, and not lose the ability to invade at a later date.
In every way you look at it, Russia’s NATO expansion excuse only makes sense if you interpret it as “We have wanted to control Ukraine and we only invaded because we were afraid we would lose our ability to do so.”.
Yes. There has been historic US involvement in Ukraine, but, by and large, Ukrainians have chosen that between two giants, they prefer the one that hasn’t committed genocide against their population and promises an improved economy. Small states affirmatively choose between great powers and pretending that those choices are simply a foregone conclusion robs those small states of their agency. Ukraine has the right to choose the US as its protector; Russia has the right to be fearful of the West. Russia does not have a right to compel obedience through invasion.
