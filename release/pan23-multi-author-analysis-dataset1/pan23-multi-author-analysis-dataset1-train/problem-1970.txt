Without knowing where you live he may have grounds for evicting you depending on the square footage of the house. Different states, and even different counties have different zoning laws. The federal government only allows 2 people per bedroom, but square footage also comes into play. Some states/counties specify a minimum floor area required for each person. For example, your state/county might require that each individual needs 165 square feet to call their own (so an 11'x15' bedroom could house one person, a 15'x22' bedroom could hold two people). I have no idea of the size of the place you were renting and divulging your county would IMO be too personal to reveal to strangers online, but I suggest you look at your state and county's laws on the matter. It is possible that by adding your daughter to the household that legally there was no longer enough room to house your family, in which case it could be deemed you broke the lease because you broke the law when you added another person.
So again this makes zero sense. I should have held my ground. I didn't. That was probably where I goofed here.
Secondly, HUD’s guidance to Public Housing Authorities in “Public Housing Occupancy Handbook Directive Number 7465.1” is: a) no more than two persons would be required to occupy a bedroom; b) persons of different generations, persons of the opposite sex and unrelated adults would not be required to share a bedroom; c) husband and wife share the same bedroom; d) children of the same sex share a bedroom; and e) children, with the possible exception of infants, would not be required to share a bedroom with persons of different generation, including their parents. This applies to the Housing Choice voucher program and public housing.
