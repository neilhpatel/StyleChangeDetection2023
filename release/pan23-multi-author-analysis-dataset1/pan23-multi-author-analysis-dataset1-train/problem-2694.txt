I think we might be looking at a permanently demilitarised Russia in the near future, albeit a Russia that will still be in possession of a semi-functional nuclear arsenal.
And the Leopard 2s. Very similar capabilities but the Ukrainians will probably have an easier time maintaining them. Abrams has a turbine engine thatâ€™ll need different tools, parts, and expertise to maintain than the diesel one in the Leopard 2. Tons of diesel vehicles already on the ground there.
I agree and it's a good point, but last I heard Russia is starting to run a pretty substantial deficit, which - I think - will eventually limit their ability to import key components without simultaneously forcing the general population to lower their quality of life in very notable ways.
not about name of cuontry. it about keeping garden clean of unwanted feces. just cos feces deplyer has already deployed in neighnouring gardens.. doesn't mean it's entitled to deploy in EVERY garden and create new neighouring gardens to poop in. have a chat with yourself.. think it over. where does the line stop? and how do you stop the line of feces before it reaches your garden?
