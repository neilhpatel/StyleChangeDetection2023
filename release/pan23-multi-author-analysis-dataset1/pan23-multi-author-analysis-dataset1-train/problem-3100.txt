It doesn’t matter in what order you buy or sell… what matters is that once you machine it, you’re now manufacturing a firearm, which is also perfectly legal in the United States on a federal level (I am unfamiliar with the laws in your state).
cringe. the point of this post was to find out if it’s legal, it’s not “going around laws” if it’s legal. anyway, the supreme court in a few states has already ruled that it’s unconstitutional to keep 18 year olds from purchasing guns, so what i would be doing is more constitutional than the laws in even asking about. plus, i never said i wanted to sell guns to kids, that’s absurd. i was asking about selling them to 18-20 year olds who can’t purchase them regularly because of unconstitutional gun laws.
Absolutely. I'm in a larger city, and there are multiple law enforcement offices here that have designated "exchange areas" in their parking lot with bright lights and video surveillance. Not just for firearms, but for your basic Craigslist stuff, too.
