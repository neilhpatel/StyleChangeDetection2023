Social benefits already go underused because of the bureaucracy around them + the scary warnings about abuse that tend to scare off even those who qualify. Now you want to massively up the amount of bureaucracy at a time when the bureaucracy is if anything overwhelmed just keeping up with unemployment claims and you want to add a whole other level to that now requires that info to be combined at the household level.
Thank you. Unfortunately her lease doesn’t expire until the end of this year. According to my PM, he has taken other tenants like mine (employed, able to pay rent and not paying) to court for eviction, and every single case has just been deferred. Sounds like I may have to wait until July when the moratorium expires, but I guess that depends on the eviction ban being lifted/Justice Dept. appeal going on right now. He did give her a “Pay or Quit” notice and advised that she will need to vacate unless she pays; she hasn’t. He also advised her that we will start showing the house and she needs to arrange times she is willing to have people in. Not sure how that will turn out.
