In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I feel the same! No one is forced to work in California prisons. They sign up to work and it’s the least they can do for ruining communities they live in. They get the best health care and a ton of extra perks for breaking laws. Shoot I have to go to the dr and get generic meds while inmates aren’t given generic. Shoot a ton even got stimulus checks while having been in prison for years. Such a joke.
Indentured servitude as punishment for a crime is constitutional, but I would argue that the current system is de facto slavery and that limitations on servitude for convicted persons should be implemented, like making it mandatory to take it into account when considering sentencing, limitations on the scope and severity of the servitude imposed, defined protections to workers, and so on. Even a single limitation would have dramatic effects: Prohibit prison labor from being used/contracted/subcontracted/leased/etc. to non-governmental organizations. You want prisoners to mow the prison lawn? Sure. Contract them out to a private company as cheap labor? Nope, that's a perverse incentive.
