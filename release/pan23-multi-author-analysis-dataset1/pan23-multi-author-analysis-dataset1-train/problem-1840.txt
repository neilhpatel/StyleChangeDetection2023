You would be suprised to know that I attended a party in 2003 in iran. The cops found the house and came inside to arest everyone. They took all bois and girls in the party. Took em to court next day and the judge said cuz there is a probability of sex between every non married couple in the party.he ordered for every one to face rape charges for men and prostitution charges for girls or geting randomly married to one another.
I try. This is the closest I could that speaks for women. . Then there's the "unless", the commentary, the whole tone of disrespect that decides over women's fate. I give up.
Absolute insanity. And they wonder why people have a problem with “their ways” this is horrible and the fact that the government supports it is disgusting but the victims family supporting it is just gross and despicable, all so they can say their daughter only “had sex” with her husband, refusing to acknowledge that rape is not sex and is not consensual 😡🤬🤯😤.
Yes. It happens all the time in Islamic countries. There was a case a while back in Egypt, a principal raped a girl so she would be forced to marry him. As was explained above, women aren’t people with intrinsic rights, they’re property, so “if you break it you buy it”.
