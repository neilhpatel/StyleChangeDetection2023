The Republican brand is the MEGA movement. Non mega’s are just a few outliers. I was registered Republican once but the party of small government, fiscal responsibility, integrity, decency and honesty does not exist. Have to be a clown to run as a Republican now. Maybe this Republican congress will fuck up enough to actually disqualify the party to just a few more voters. I hope Trump wins the nomination, he will lose in a landslide no matter who the Dem’s run. Hell he lost big to sleepy Joe.
Our recent successes in 2020 and 2022 were the result of Democrats being the angriest and most motivated I've ever seen them in my 50-sometthing years, and the results are that we still need to rely on R support to get anything passed in the House, and still have 2 extra Rs in the senate named Manchin and Sinema -.
Yeah. I'm not unhappy with the most recent election, at least overall, but to think that things couldn't turn around in a couple years is short sighted. All it would take is for people to become apathetic again, and not turn out to vote.
