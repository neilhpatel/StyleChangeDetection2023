I know by the 20th century the French govt started seeing these population trends as a geopolitical liability, but how early did they start trying to remedy it? And how?
Karen Offen in The Woman Question in France, 1400-1870 points to official concerns as far back as the 16th century, expressed notably in successive laws against abortion and infanticide: we might recall also royal opposition to mass movement of settlers to north America from the early days of the French presence, unlike England's approach. Indeed it's worth recalling that France had been losing ground relatively since at least 1650, adding under a quarter in the subsequent century as repeated famine and epidemics killed millions. The Revolution's leaders too sought to encourage marriage and were indeed rewarded with a small boost in the 1790s before military campaigning drew young men far afield, over a million dying in the process. The 19th century was however marked by conservative distrust of the emerging social sciences that might have offered solutions: not until after the defeat of 1870 does awareness of the urgency of the issue seem to have become general, and even then and with the ascendancy of modernising Republicanism, direct policy responses seem hard to identify. Perhaps it was beyond the capacity of the state, or perhaps a low-pressure demographic status quo offered domestic dividends while leaders looked to overseas empire and its peoples to buttress the nation against its rivals: Paris would still be great, but would it have been the envy of Europe if France had followed England's trajectory?
Thanks for the answer, that was very insightful! I never thought inheritance and slow urbanisation could affect the fertility rate of a country to such a degree, but it makes sense when you think about it.
