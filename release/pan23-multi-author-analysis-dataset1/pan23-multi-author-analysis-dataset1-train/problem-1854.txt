I went to a small bachelor party many years ago at the Borgatta in AC and in order to have a table at their night club you needed to order a bottle of liquor or champagne for every 2 people in your party. There were 4 of us so we looked at the drink menu and I shit you not the bottles ranged from 900-1200 dollars each. We ordered 2 bottles of grey goose which retail for $52 each at the time and they charged us $1200 each for them. I wasnâ€™t paying for any of it and I was completely blown away. We drank 1 bottle between us and gave the other to the bachelorette party at the table next to us. Never again.
Later I give in, since I genuinely did not wanted to be kicked out and I had a feeling that if I ask for a refund they won't give me my money back for the entrance I paid in cash (especially since they did not give me a receipt, I have no proof that I paid) . So I had to order one alcoholic drink for my brother even though he was not in a mood to drink. Since we just went to enjoy the artist perform and dance.
