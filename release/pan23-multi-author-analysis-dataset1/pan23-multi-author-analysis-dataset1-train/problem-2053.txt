Bidens got an approval rating hovering at or below 40%, he is absolutely gaff prone, and is clearly not as sharp as he once was, he has a weird history of touching, petting and sniffing women and children which is on film, the senate won in the midterms in spite of Biden, probably more due to young voters actually showing up because of Roe and trump pushing for a bunch of nutcase Jan. 6th truthers. Biden could beat trump again because people will be voting against trump more than for Biden. But at his age, and mumbling public speeches, Biden isn’t going to inspire young voters to the polls or bring in the Harder left wing portions of the party. If Desantis wins the nomination the Dems are in trouble if they stick with Biden, desantis is way more intelligent than people give him credit for, he can play to the MAGA crowd while also appeal toward minority voters like he did in south Florida. He’s a good public speaker and would absolutely roll over an 82 year old Biden on the debate stage. I think the Democrats need to look towards the future especially if trump doesn’t get the Republican nomination.
Absolutely incorrect. It predicts it in many conceivable ways. If you can't get a lot of people out to support you in the primary, it will be much harder to make them magically appear in the general.
Exactly. Biden has a real good shot to remain president. The Democratic party pushing him out would make them just as much a circus as the Republicans and would really backfire.
