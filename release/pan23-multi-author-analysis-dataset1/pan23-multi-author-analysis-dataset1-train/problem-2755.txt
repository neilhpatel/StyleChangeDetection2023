If there's any sort of justice in the world that'd be the seventh circle of hell. Probably no such luck so I'll be content with through the nearest window.
Russia seems to always float between inferiority complex and megalomania. First, the Western slavic states of Poland, Hungary and Bohemia (Czechia) adopt (or get forced to) Christianity, then they are turned into kingdoms or are part of the Holy Roman Empire. Kiev gets conquered, Moscow gets conquered, but then the tide slowly turns as Russian Empire emerges and the western slavic states cease to exist, being incorporated in other empires or partitioned between them. Then the slavic nationhoods begin to wake and Poland, Czechia and Hungary are independent for a brief moment before getting under the soviet boot. They all fight the oppression one way or another to finally emerge in the current era of EU integration and relative prosperity.
No. Romania doesn't have the right to call itself the real Rome nor the right to invade all of Italy and eradicate its culture just because it called itself in a similar fashion to the old empire.
