Does your employer use the rounding method for clocking in and out? Meaning, do they round to the nearest quarter hour? So if you clock in at 9:07AM or wild round go 9AM but if you clock in at 9:08AM it would round to 9:15.
Your comment was removed as bad advice because you presumed a widespread violation of employment law and suggested the OP seek remedy via skipping the whole entire way to consulting an attorney to bring a class action, not to contact DLSE, or take any immediate action to resolve their specific dispute through the existing channels to do so. As you have since deleted, I can't go over it in more detail, but I do remember removing a comment in this post and finding it problematic due to being speculative and advising the OP take a disordered approach.
As an aside, the comment removal said to edit the comment and message us through modmail when you did, not delete and make a new post complaining that we removed your last one. We don't like to distract from people's questions by litigating mod actions in the thread. This response is totally fine and well explained, and I will leave it up despite ignoring the directions in the removal, but please take note in the future.
