It's just a sign that boomers are on their way out. They can only sustain their path of excluding the youth vote for so long before it seriously started biting them in the ass. 2 million baby boomers die from old age every year and are replaced by over 4 million gen Z of voting age. The GOP needs to temper their extreme stances or they'll solidify three generations of liberal politics. Similar to how we've currently had 3 generations of conservative politics.
Fuck. Well, everyone, get ready for endless government shutdowns, shrill conspiracy theories, and scream-y "investigations" into Hunter Biden's laptop, or some other dumb shit. Needless to say, the January 6th commission is done for, so I hope they're in warp speed getting shit over to DOJ. Fuck. I really had a slim hope that somehow we'd pull it out.
Exactly. They barely win as it is and the first thing they do is go after Biden in an impeachment? I’d think even the anti-Trump impeachment would think “we can handle more important stuff right now”.
