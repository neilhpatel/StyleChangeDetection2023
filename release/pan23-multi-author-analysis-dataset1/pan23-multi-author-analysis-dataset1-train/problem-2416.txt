I mean obviously. The T tanks are much smaller and lighter but how does the M1 compare the the A4 or A6 (or whatever variant is on the table). That is the comparison to make.
Sure, the Abrams guzzles fuel like a frat party does beer, but it can still be used in a defensive posture for, what the US claims, is an expected Russian push in the coming months… and it’s hardly like we are seeing hundreds of kilometres in advancements, the lines have been stable for a few months now and we typically see, at most a couple dozen Kilometer movements.
I wish I could go, but I'd die in a heartbeat and probably get someone else killed. I'd probably be a coward the first time a shot was fired. I can't imagine what Ukrainians are going through. I'd die for my family and household, but it turns my brain thinking it could ever really happen. I hope I am half as good as these men, women, and children when the time comes.
And fuel is hardly a cost consideration when billions is being sent in Ukraine’s direction and it’s not exactly operating it’s fixed wing forces at full capacity, so should have a relative excess of jet fuel.
