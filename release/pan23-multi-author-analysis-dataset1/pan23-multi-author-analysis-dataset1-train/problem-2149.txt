Its been a while since I've read it but the crux of the argument is that thsse were not overly patriotic or cruel men. They had no ambitions to be party leaders and their hate and racism would be about average for the time (not just in Germany, these prejudices were felt in some degree across the western world). They were average men who had been inundated with party propaganda for years. They were often middle aged and unfit to go to the front lines of the military. This was marketed as a way for them to participate in the war and to help their country as best they can. It can almost be compared to how in the United States buttons were made for poeple who wanted to go to war but wefe medically ineligible. It was terrible for those men to believe in the war but be unable to assist. That is how it was sold at least.
Of course, the reasons for all of these auxiliaries to participate were likewise varied and subject to the same forces as mentioned in the comment above, plus the fact that at least in the ghettos, many of those figures found themselves in impossible positions, and were ultimately murdered themselves.
