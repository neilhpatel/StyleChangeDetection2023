The most thorough examination of this issue is found in Bruce G. Peabody's article "George Washinon, Presidential Term Limits, and the Problem of Reluctant Political Leadership", published in Presidential Studies Quarterly in September 2001.
Thank you for the amazing answer. The more I learn about Washinon, the more respect I have for the man.
On Peabody's second point, the author argues Washinon had a history of being concerned with securing his social standing, which, in late 18th Century Virginia society, meant "the public exhibition of distinguished service and virtuous political behavior, especially disinterested commitment to the public good" in the eyes of his upper-class Virginian (and American) peers. To that end, when Washinon turned down Trumbull's plea to re-enter politics, he wrote of his fear of being received as an old, weak imbecile.
Washinon turned down the suggestion, that he would be "charged not only with irresolution, but with concealed ambition". He preferred "to pass through the vale of life in retirem[en]t, undisturbed in the remnant of the days I have to sojourn here".
