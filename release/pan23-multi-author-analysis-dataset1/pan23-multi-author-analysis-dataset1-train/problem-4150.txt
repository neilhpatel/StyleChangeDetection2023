All of these things have been detailed in prophecy. Jesus says: You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.
What happened in Iran is quite interesting, I remember there was a talk about mercenaries being involved in the oppression of the protests, its weird how US/Israel isnt supplying and helping the resistance groups in Iran, it would probably be better for them and for the iranian people if there was a coup there.
Yep. I come from a kinda Zionist family I don't get along with and got a degree in Political Science from a West-coast liberal arts university where ultimate frisbee was our most popular sport, so I'm no stranger to the nuanced and not-so-nuanced reasons that Israel is a dick, but when a nation whose loudly stated intent is to push every one of you into the sea starts getting close to being able to do so, I think a strong reaction is warranted.
Agreed. But if the Iranians start mass murdering, torturing and starving their citizens on a huge scale, something could be done. But not if they have nukes. It's now or never for the Iranian people.
