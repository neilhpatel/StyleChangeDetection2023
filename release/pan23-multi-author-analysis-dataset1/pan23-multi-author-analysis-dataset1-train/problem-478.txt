The main use, at least according to literature, was for suicide by cutting the throat to avoid capture when a castle (etc.) fell during war. It was carried as a normal dress item, more to symbolise the intent to use it to protect honour by committing suicide rather than with any expectation of actually using it commit suicide (except during sieges!). The practical effect was that women were normally armed, and could use such a knife for self-defence, or to defend others. Bandits would be unlikely to be any threat unless travelling (in which case, there would be an armed escort). The threat would be thieves or surprise attack by enemies - upper-class women probably had less need to carry weapons for self-defence than other women, except in times of war.
Upper-class women carried knives for self-defence (and suicide as a form of self-defence), and generally had less cause to fear sudden assassination, so had less use for heavy weapon-fans than men.
Interesting. So what was the reason that upper-class women wouldâ€™ve carried knives for self-defense? Was banditry a common occurrence in Japan at this time, or was the danger in the form of enemy forces during times of war? Did women ever carry katanas or any other weapons? Thanks for the really informative response!
