There’s a reason that’s “not a well known law”. Because it isn’t. In fact the post you are talking about says this “ . if you resign your job, then you do not get unemployment”. It doesn’t distinguish between your current job and your previous job. If you resign you don’t get unemployment. Period.
I find it hard to believe the state would allow a former and new employer off the UE hook in this scenario. Assuming the employee has a continuous work history with no gaps establishing 4 base periods.
Please . If after doing so, you believe this was in error, or you’ve edited your post to comply with the rules, . Do not make a second post or comment.
I’m finding it hard to believe that if you voluntarily left your previous job (making you normally ineligible for unemployment) obtaining employment elsewhere but being terminated not for cause during your probationary period could make your first employer liable for your unemployment. I would think that ship sailed the moment you gave notice to employer number 1.
