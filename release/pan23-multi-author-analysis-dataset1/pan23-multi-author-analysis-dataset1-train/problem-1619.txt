At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century the word "autocracy" increasingly appeared in European dictionaries, as foreigners tried to back-translate "samoderzhets" and resorted to the Greek term. But at this point "autocracy" was simply a synonym for sovereignty. Isabel de Madariaga traced the conceptual history of "autocrat" as a back-translation of the word "samoderzhets" in a very detailed article and asked the same question as you: "How and when did the word 'autocrat' come to be so systematically and uniquely associated with the Russian form of government?". She suggests that the answer consists of three reasons:
Throughout the 19th century there was plenty of agitation for constitutional limitations--Mikhail Speransky, under Alexander I, proposed and instituted what he envisaged as a constitutional parliament in 1810. In practice this was more-or-less an advisory body that failed to really advise the tsar, but this lays the foundation for the Duma of 1906 (which I've spoken of in the past as, again, a rather impotent body).
