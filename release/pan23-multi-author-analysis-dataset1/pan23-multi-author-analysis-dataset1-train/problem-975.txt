The way some of the pups on here talk it was America that started the holocaust lol. They learn little tid bits about the bad shit we've gotten up to that has benefitted their cushy ass lives and act as if they've uncovered a mystery. No most of us know about America's short comings. The difference in a democracy is this stuff comes to light and can be changed. I hate being that guy but I'd love for a large portion of our society to live in Russia and or China for a year. Let me know how free you feel....then learn some of their history for real creative ways on how to treat people lol.
Seriously. Of course America has done fucked up stuff like every other country, but there's a reason we're the leaders of the NATO military and there's a reason everyone runs to us when China or Russia start acting up.
how old are you son? notice that you did not say that you care about my people, cuz you don't, and you don't care about Ukrainians either, you just follow the hate against everything on the east.
