I have hear that it was pushed by politicians with a rural backing to avoid giving more power to the big urban centers and their politicians. Is there any truth to that?
If a small town is selected for various reasons to serve as a capital, it can then experience a great deal of public spending to build the structure of government - a capitol and various government office buildings - and this can discourage moving the site of state government if and when population trends leave a place behind.
I'm sure there are other factors we could think of, but by my experience, these have been the causes of sometimes-smaller communities being selected and remaining as the capital.
There are several factors that have resulted in smaller communities becoming and remaining state capitals.
A second common reason for the selection of a small town as capital was a desire to locate a capital in the center of the state. This is clearly not always a criterion, but when it is, it can explain why a small town was and remains the capital. In this situation as with capital sites selected for other reasons, we have to understand that sometimes being a capital results in a place becoming larger than it might otherwise be. That is a response to other historical forces that can cause a small place to grow larger because of the presence of state government.
