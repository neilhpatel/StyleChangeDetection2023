It is the norm for employment pensions to be paid out in the form of an annuity, often for the rest of the recipient's life. (Though there are other forms of annuity.) Some employer annuities have the option of being a joint annuity with a spouse, so the payments continue in the event of death.
Some annuities guarantee a certain minimum total payout if the recipient dies early, many do not. (It would be rare for an employment annuity to do this; that feature is usually for annuities that you purchase yourself.).
Contact an attorney familiar with Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (QDROs). A QDRO is not what you need, but these Attorneys are very familiar with ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) as well as being familiar with the terms of each retirement plan. Was your father married at the time of death and what did he choose at the time of retirement for his Retirement Option Election. (Single Life - Self Only or a Joint and Survivor benefit). Find out if there are any beneficiaries listed on the plan or a one time lump sum death benefit. An attorney familiar with the specific retirement plan will be able to help best. So sorry for your loss.
