Yeah, like this probably isn't Putins direct fault, but is more likely a fault of management in Russia's internal pharmaceutical industry along with I'm sure the vast sanctions against Russia not helping the problem.
3. No sanctions yet on medicine,so I can't explain this phenomenal. We are importing goods from Poland, Germany and The Netherlands but somehow we can't import medicine from these countries.if someone is using this as a way to cause a dissatisfaction among the population then I am in for it. Maybe we will be brave enough to face the stormtroopers.
In addition to that both countries also had heavily industrialized economies prior to WWII, and basically they needed to go through some hard years during rebuilding but with the investment poured in through the Marshall Plan, both experienced economic "miracles" and their economies rebounded massively.
1. This guy does not care about the general population. He doesn't even know what type of drugs are really missing. Drugs for Parkinson are the one in really shortfall.
