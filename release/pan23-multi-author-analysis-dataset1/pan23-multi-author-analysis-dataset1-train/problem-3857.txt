The politicians push against her because you can't attract a moderate vote with her as the face of your party. The online grifters who make their money convincing morons that they're really an unheard contingent, a silent majority, of persecuted patriots can't have things going too mainstream because it both directly contradicts the aforementioned selling point of their persecution fetish and makes them a target of demonetization though bans and advertisers refusing to work with them. And that's before you get into the whole problem being that appealing to extremism begets extremism, and once you start down that path the only place you can grow to try to expand your audience is to become more extreme. It's why modern day conservativism is fundamentally incompatible with a system of democratically elected representatives, since it relies on good faith action and a willingness to compromise.
