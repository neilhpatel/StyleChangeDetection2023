I work in property management. What you're suggesting doesn't make any sense at all. We had to start doing screenings because people ALWAYS lie in the interview process. Before screening, the majority of people renting were causing serious damages and costing the property owner more money than they were bringing in. The tenant screening is imperative to making sure you don't have someone that is unstable and is actually capable of maintaining their income and ability to pay rent. I can't tell you how many times people come in looking great and they say they have stable income, only to move in, trash the place and then not pay rent. And it happens far more in the "affordable housing" group than any other. The screening shows employment history, history of residence and credit check. All we want to see is that you don't change jobs and move around every couple months (red flags), as over the past 50 years of doing this, that almost always is the biggest indicator of future problems. Beyond what any in person interview can provide you.
