Swearing and ribald jokes were considered quite masculine, and not suitable for feminine ears or eyes. Anything.
In his study "British Recognition of American Speech in the Eighteenth Century" published in the journal American Speech, he includes a brief passage about various British visitors in those early years accusing Americans of having foul mouths:

So, to go back to OP's question, it's extremely unlikely that words like "shit" and "fuck" were unknown to the average English speaker until after WWI, given all the evidence we have of their use, as the above comments so adeptly pointed out (not to mention the fact that both are very old words). But the further back you go, words like "damn" and "goddamn" may have been a lot more common in a person's vocabulary than they are nowadays, where someone might opt for "fuck" or "fucking", as language and word usage so often follow popular trends.
