when you use your debit card as "credit", typically these transactions will show pending (and deducted from your available balance) 1-3 days before they actually post to your account. they post to your account after the credit card processor the merchant uses settles these transactions which are done in a large batch process at night. unfortunately these companies don't have to settle within the 3 days these transactions are pending and some transactions are authorized for $1 and then the real charge is only known to the bank during that settlement process (think gasoline purchases) additionally, they have no idea what transactions you've authorized on a reoccurring basis (which typically, if done with a debit card, don't get reauthorized for each transaction and just come through during the settlement process... if it's with your routing and account number, there is no pending timeframe).
What do you mean, "sneakily"? Are these legitimate charges or are they fraud? If the latter, you should be reporting them to the bank as such, so that they can reverse the charges and refund you the fees. If they're legitimate, you need to do a better job of staying on top of your balance so that you don't incur overdraft fees.
