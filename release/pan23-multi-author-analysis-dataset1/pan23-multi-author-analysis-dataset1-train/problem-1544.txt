A number of British merchant ships were disguised as warships, during both world wars. However, the aim here was largely not to scare off submarines or to invite attacks on them. Instead, they were intended to confuse enemy spies and reconnaissance units about the location of major British ships. I've written a longer piece about these programs, . While most of these ships spent much of their time in port, two decoys did spend time protecting merchant shipping. In WWI, the Cevic, described as the battlecruiser Queen Mary, made a cruise of the US eastern seaboard, to give German merchant raiders using American ports the impression that a large, fast British ship was on hand to chase them down in case they left harbour.
Ah. In that case, no, I don't think there were any efforts to do that. The hull shape for most merchant ships is pretty significantly different than that of most warships; a ship designed to carry large amounts of cargo is built differently than a warship designed to maneuver at higher speeds. There were some interesting camouflage patterns painted on some merchant ships to break up their outline and make it difficult for U-boats to determine their heading/speed, but I don't know of anything like what you're describing.
