Well... Part of the Scholz government coalition agreement was to move towards federalization of the EU, which is the deepest of integration possible.
TL;DR: Further integration is a no-brainer, but people don't want it because many EU-governments (incl. Germany) keep doing shit other Europeans don't like. Which means it's not a no-brainer after all.
BEIJING, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday that as big nations with influence, China and Germany should work together all the more during "times of change and turmoil" for the sake of world peace, according to state media.
On point. Regarding hindering factors to deeper integration, I maybe would add issues of national pride (military for example), and that a few governments need to use the EU / western countries as scapegoats for their problems (PiS for example, or GB before brexit).
E.g. changing the currency to Euro. Some people see it as losing identity. Other people think currency doesn't matter with identity. Other people see it as preserving nationality to change.
