1 child alone would cause a massive population contraction but it's worse cause families focused on having boys to "keep the family name alive". So the ratio is also massively skewed.
Quite the opposite, they have the aggression of a Chihuahua, however they also have the same combat prowess; in other words they will constantly talk about how they're going to overthrow the government and defend themselves and even occasionally get a few hits off on undefended civilians -- however they will lose every single fight they will ever participate in with anyone just slightly better trained.
I doubt there’s even that many. 10s of thousands if that. The saying most Republicans would immigrate to Russia is starting to feel like the left’s version of the “there’s cat litter and litter boxes” in high schools. Obviously the right’s is far more absurd, but I have yet to see millions of republicans say they’d move to/fight for Russia. It’s all absurd.
Luckily there are tens of millions of brainwashed American Men that would be happy to immigrate and even fight for Russia against what they perceive to be globalists, so really you can take care of two problems at once; three really, when you include the fact these same American men have the combat capability and aggression of a chihuahua.
