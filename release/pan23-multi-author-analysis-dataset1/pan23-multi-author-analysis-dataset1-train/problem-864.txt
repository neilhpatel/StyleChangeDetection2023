The major reason is that, despite modern-day Russia being just across the Bering Strait from Alaska, the Chukchi Peninsula (the part of Russia in question) is really, really, really far from where the Russian state was in 1500. Here is a to give a sense of what Russia (technically, the Grand Duchy of Moscow) looked like in the late 15th century (the green area). The Chukchi Peninsula is some 4,000 miles (as the crow flies) from the eastern parts of the Grand Duchy at the time, and although Muscovy was taking over the fur trade along the White Sea that had previously been controlled by Novgorod, they were still a long way from the Pacific Ocean, and importantly had a number of major states in their path - a group of Turco-Mongol successor states, namely the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan on the Volga, and the Khanate of Sibir near what is now Tobolsk in Western Siberia.
Ivan IV was declared Tsar of all Russians in 1547. That is considered the beginning of the unified Russian state, because before that, there were several competing Grand Duchies.
The most successful of these Grand Duchies was Moscow, and the Grand Duchy of Moscow formed the basis of the Russian state. In 1547 (50 years after Columbus), Moscow . None of the Russian grand duchies controlled territory anywhere near the Bering strait in 1492.
Non-existant. Certain Alaskan natives had contacts with other tribes across the Bering strait like the Yupiit (Bering Sea Eskimos) and the IÃ±upiat (Northern Eskimos) with the Chukchi in Siberia however the Japanese did not venture that far North and did not make any notable contact with Alaska prior to Russia colonisation.
