It makes no difference if you went through a company for the sublease or not. You have a valid sublease and you cannot unilaterally modify the terms. If you try to illegally evict him by breaking the lease before the term is up, you have significant liability.
Your roommate (the one that is on the lease with you) can also not unilaterally break the lease. Even if they move out they are still responsible for paying the rent (as are you). If you subtenant does not want to leave, and your roommate moves out and refuses to pay, you will have to continue paying the full rent and then can sue your roommate for their portion.
Your best three options are to either tell your roommate you aren't willing to break the lease, negotiate a break with your subtenant, or sublet the basement for whatever you can get and then you and/or your roommate can pay the difference.
Thank you! I mean I have always just assumed it's legal for the ten years Ive lived there and there are two other duplexes in my building with the exact same layout... but not sure how to know for sure that it's actually legal?
