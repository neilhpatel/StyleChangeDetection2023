Ukraine will need hundreds of thousands of troops to match Russia's recent build-up. As winter cold sets in putin has the most/highest leverage by providing heat (gas/oil) to neighboring countries in exchange for loyalty and troops to add to his multi-country force. The Balkans, some -istan countries, (and maybe Hungary) are signing with putin for gas now, together with Iranian, Chechnyan, Belarus and N.Korean troops. Ukraine could be easily overwhelmed by a huge winter assault soon. Unfortunately, while Russia is building a huge multi-hundred thousand force, Ukraine can't because NATO and the EU won't add fighters. In the end Ukraine will be overrun and Europe will have a closer, stronger Russia. BTW, watch the Black Sea for an increased attack force to go into Ukraine through Moldova and Navy missiles. putin won't squander this unique leveraged opportunity. Kick putin.
Russia cannot meaningfully increase deliveries to Ukraine as their railroads lack sufficient spare parts and signalling capacity for train dispatch. For as shit as America's railroads can be, American investment in computer-controlled signalling over the past century allows for much longer trains running much faster at higher frequencies. If Biden needed to scale up American munitions transports by 10x he could probably do it, the only limiting factors being the willingness of Laborers and available intermodal containers. Both of these can be negotiated with as FDR successfully did in 1941, whereby he legalized Unions nationally.
