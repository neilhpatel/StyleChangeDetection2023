Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we're letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as 'Why didn't X do Y' relatively often don't get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, 'why didn't X do Y' questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It's worth remembering that people in the past couldn't see into the future, and they generally didn't have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn't necessarily look that way at the time.
As a portuguese, D. Sebasti√£o is a symbol of hope. It doesn't matter that he failed, it matters that he returns to give us back the independency from Spain (= the feeling of him bringing something good remains, because being under the rule of Spain is not well seen in our history). His return also brings the promise of glory and better days for the economy etc. So to this day, since we keep being under economic crisis, we kinda still wait for him to fix all our problems.
