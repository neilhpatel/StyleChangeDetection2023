The main event of the tournament was the melee, which took place over a large area usually between two designated points, which would be the two main camping sites for the visiting nobility - William Marshall's first melee was held between Sainte Jamme and Valennes in an area nearly thirty miles across and contained hundreds of knights, which according to Asbridge was typical for the time.
As to their frequency, they could be held on any day that was not a holiday and not between Lent and Easter - with Asbridge saying that on the tournament "circuit" of Northern France and the Low Counties an event could be being held as frequently as every fortnight, announced in advance so Contestants could plan their travel in advance, and would draw knights and higher nobles from across Europe with King William the Lion of Scotland even travelling to take part in some French tournaments.
People generally did use blunted weapons. For example, almost every tournament opened with a cavalry charge, and the contestants would put a rubber-like ball on the ends of their lances so that they would still unhorse their opponent, but not run them through with a lance. This was convention pretty early on, at least by the time that William Marshall started at the tournaments in the mid-12th century, though it's less clear if swords were expected to be blunted. A lot of people did use blunted swords - injuries like broken bones were common, which is consistent with blunt force rather than the impact of a sharp blade - but it wasn't a formal requirement.
