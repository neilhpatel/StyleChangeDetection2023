I would never tell a young person--especially not a depressed young person--that it doesn't get better because, of course, I can't predict the future. It looked like we had the world by the balls but then 9/11 and 2008 happened and we got a shit sandwich. But I wouldn't say it gets better either because, right now, it doesn't; if we want people who are young today to have a future, it's going to take a whole lot of us, from multiple generations, fighting because nothing less will do the job than to depose the ruling class.
Hi PerfectConfection578. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
absolutely. i'm pretty sure i wouldn't be around today if i had access to guns growing up. in my high school- early 20s, i had gotten close to the edge on that, and if the quick "solution" of a gun to the head were a few rooms down, i'm sure i'd at least get to the point where it'd be in my hand.
