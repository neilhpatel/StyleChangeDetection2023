Yup, but then so have congressional democrats, they should have demanded a 2/3rds vote (constitutional 14th amendment style) to seat any congressman who gave aid and comfort to the leader of the jan 6th insurrection by refusing to impeach him. "But they were just voting, how can you claim they did anything wrong?" "So you're saying they used their official position in government to try and protect the leader of the insurrection from the consequences of his actions... thats not a very good argument there Mr republican" they could have wiped out the republican party in a heart beat and used the intervening weeks to remove the Santos and sitting senators. But they are cowards just like wait two years to pass the buck Garland.

Curious. Will they self fund their investigations into whatever it is they want to investigate? This seems like it's only half thought out on their part. And if it is privately investigated, how is that credible? I mean, it's not.
