Yeah no. The future of politics is fair representation for the millions of progressives who are currently outvoted by empty land. DC and PR statehood. Abolish the senate and uncap the house and institute an age limit of 70. Thatâ€™s the future.

Joe Biden won the Democratic Party's nomination in large part--if not entirely--because African American voters rejected "Defund the Police" and other more progressive movements that they correctly identified as mostly driven by young white people who value being seen as an "ally" to the black community more than they value the practicality of achievable policies that will lead to better governance, policing, and service to historically underserved, marginalized, and oppressed communities.
