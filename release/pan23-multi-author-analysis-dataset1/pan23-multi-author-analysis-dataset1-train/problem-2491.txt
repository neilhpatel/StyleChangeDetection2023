My parents are in their 70's. Their home isn't paid off, and Mom loses his retirement when he dies. She'll have to sell within 15 months, there will be no money after that. I'm still (30 years later) the only college graduate in my family. I'm the only one whose kids are in college. Our biggest win was buying our home when we did, and sticking with it. We didn't upgrade, though I wanted to several times. Our house will be paid off when we're 60. My husband stuck out his career in public service, which meant while he made a decent living, he could have made more in private sector. We stuck it out for the insurance/benefits and the retirement plan. Hopefully we can set our children up in ways our parents weren't able for us. With these conditions, I don't see either becoming a homeowner by 28 like we did! .

On the one hand these are self proclaimed "populists" who love to incessantly remind us of the dishonest and oppressive nature of the "establishment", of politicians in Washinon, the cut and dry, "us vs them" worldview, but at the same time these pseudo populists with their half baked paranoid delusions are more than eager to indiscriminately embrace whatever narrative, message or platitude closely aligns with their political ideology, whatever appeals to their identity as a conservative.
