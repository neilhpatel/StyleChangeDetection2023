Screened Her Going Down by Norman Shaw is a self-published book from 1984, and it's the life story of the USS Hammann, the OTHER ship the US Navy lost at Midway. She was sunk while alongside the crippled USS Yorktown, and preceded the carrier to the ocean floor... "screening her on the way down.".
I cannot decide if he is saying that the data underdetermines the hypothesis, but he presenting the hypothesis 'pointedly' (which I take to mean both clearly and forcefully) despite that, in the hopes that it will stimulate future research and discussion OR if he means that the hypothesis is nicely supported by the current data, but it's unclear if the hypothesis will be supported by future data and so he's extending the hypothesis since it proved useful in the past, with the hopes of eventual confirmation or disconfirmation.
That's how many of us started! My degrees are in anthropology and museum studies (though specifically fashion-focused museum studies - but still, classes were way more focused on the practical side than the theoretical).
