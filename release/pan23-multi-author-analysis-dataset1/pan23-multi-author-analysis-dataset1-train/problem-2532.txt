There’s nothing predatory about actively monitoring locations that a tow company has responsibility for and for them fulfilling their contractual obligations with the property owners.
“After business hours. That is not a handicapped spot. Once their office is closed. Its just another parking spot. A handicapped person wouldnt need to use that spot. There's no office to go to. Its closed. The signs say. 6-8 parking allowed. They dont say except handicapped spot. By law. They need a sign. That speifies parking in handicapped spot may result in tow. They dont have one posted. Im telling you. Ill get you the number for the big boss manager. Just make sure you put together a good fact filled argument. How what they did was wrong. Get in touch with her. Explain. Youll get your car back. Dont just give up. Thats what they want you to do. Onve you give in and pay. Youve lost. You wont get anything back then.” This is a text I got from the neighbor who saw the whole thing and has gone through illegal towing before.
