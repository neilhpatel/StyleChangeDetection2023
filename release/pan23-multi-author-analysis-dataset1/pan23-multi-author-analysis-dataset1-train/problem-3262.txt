Anyone can sue anyone, but as described this is not a lawsuit that they would win (nor that would be worth their while, unless they feel extremely lucky and you're rich). At-will means you can walk out right now.
It's the responsibility of the company's owner/board/management to staff it appropriately and make sure there's cross-training and coverage. They CAN sue you, as anyone can file suit against anyone else, but they wouldn't succeed. If, as you say, there's no contract, no collective bargaining agreement (aka you're not in a union), and you're not in a jurisdiction that doesn't have at-will employment (in the US, only Montana, but lots of non-US countries don't have at-will) then you can walk out the door and the only REAL power they have is to give future reference-seekers the truthful information that you left them in the lurch with no notice. They can sue, and if you get served actual lawsuit paperwork you'll need to respond and possibly show up to court to defend yourself, but they won't win.
