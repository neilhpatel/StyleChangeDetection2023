No, this flag thing is just Finnish culture. This is not some oppression thing, because all nations have some kind of culture. That is not oppression. Existence of a culture.
But cultures are what they are. Why should we be like the others in this thing? Who says that they are right and we are wrong? Who can be the judge? I personally like it, that people are forced to show some respect at least in some situations. And this is not a big thing for me. I just can't see any real reason to change anything, because people will survive even if they are not allowed to burn a flag. ðŸ˜Š.
What if a neighborhood organizes a communal flag recycle burning session in a public park in an effort to reduce carbon from multiple individual fires?
Yes we fucking can. FGM is wrong. Not objectively for you maybe but I'm calling it out. Everything morality wise is subjective by definition.
Is Moscow part of Finland now? Perhaps this is Vladimir's new 5D chess strategy; surrender Moscow to the Finns so that when Ukraine drone-bombs the Kremlin, Finland will be obligated to retaliate against them. It can't fail!
