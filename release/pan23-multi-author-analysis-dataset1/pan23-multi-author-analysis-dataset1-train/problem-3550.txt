There's no genuine controversy here: John Demjanjuk was not Ivan the Terrible. We know that for a fact, just as like we know for a fact that he was in Sobibor various series trying to make this into a "he said, she said" notwithstanding.
Interesting. I kept thinking "satanic panic" the entire time I was watching the docuseries. "We believe the survivors" was uncannily like "we believe the children".
So only three witnesses - Boraks, Levkowitch and Lindwasser - identified Demjanjuk immediately and with certainty. Unfortunately, their testimonies cannot be shown to be independent since they were late and it had to be investigated what they knew before their identifications from the other survivors. However Levkowitch did not testify during the trial (her testimony was withdrawn), Lindwasser died before it and Boraks' memory more or less completely failed him during the trial, so the issue remained uninvestigated - but most probably their testimonies were not indepedent from those of Turowski, Goldfarb and Rosenberg. Due to deaths and for other reasons only 5 witnesses testified in the Jerusalem court (Rosenberg, Czarny, Boraks, Epstein, and Rajchman).
