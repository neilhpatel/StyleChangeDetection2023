Take pictures of your car as soon as you can, make sure the metadata has the date of the photos attached. Record what happened, and any other useful details you can think of. Write the date of when you recorded it.
Just a side note, typically if you are on federal probation you are not suppose to help any law enforcement agency in any way with any kind of information without going through your probation officer, with that being said although you don’t need one, if contacted by law enforcement again tell them that for your excuse of why you can’t speak with them without your probation officer and attorney present, don’t offer any information like hitting a curb or anything, all they’re trying to do is get you to incriminate yourself anyways.
I will do that. I was planning on calling her and my attorney tomorrow. Good idea, I didn't really answer questions from the cop I just said if I hit a car I would be aware and I wouldn't drive away and he asked for a copy of my insurance card and I happily gave that. Was that a mistake?
