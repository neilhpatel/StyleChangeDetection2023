First of all, while the Dreyse needle gun was indeed a bolt action rifle, it was still a one-shot weapon - it had a bolt, but no magazine, so every shot had to be reloaded manually. It was a successful breechloaded design that allowed the Prussians to use their rifle swarm tactics, where troops sought cover and fired sitting, hunching or even lying down while muzzle-loaded rifles were hard to reload unless you were standing.
The US had its own breechloading weapon in the Hall M1819 rifle and M1833 carbine, which were decently successful weapons. Other countries also experimented with breechloaders - Norway introduced the Kammerlader 1842, for example. However, breechloaders in general had problems with reliability, gas leakage, problems with breeches bursting or wearing out, less power (due to the gas leakage) and complex designs causing icnrease wear and tear. The Dreyse needle rifles needed their needles replaced regularly, and the rifles needed extensive maintenance after a few months in the field, so the availability after a few moths of campaign was really low.
In other words, they knew. The great barrier to the immediate adoption of breech-loading guns by the War dept. was the immense scale of production needed to outfit an army- a huge expense in peacetime. They would spend $90,000 in 1854 and $42, 350 in 1858 to purchase guns from private manufacturers. They would the spend millions purchasing them during the Civil War, but it was simply not possible to quickly convert the armories to making them. Even after the Civil War, the government would reject dozens of quite good designs in favor of a stop-gap , the Allin Conversion of the rifled musket, which made use of a lot of not only existing rifled muskets, but the machine tools, jigs and fixtures that made rifled musket parts. The use of those tools increased production, but made that production pretty inflexible, and not easy to change.
