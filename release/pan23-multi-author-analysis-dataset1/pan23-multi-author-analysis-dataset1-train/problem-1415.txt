It just sucks you know? Like she was so happy but when I visited their home to see Munchi, when they brought her she was extremely scared nervous and like her face was all different. I felt so bad. Then that crazy mom scared her on purpose. How can you do that to an animal.
If you suspect neglect contact animal services/animal control. If you have a Municipality/County animal per dwelling limit you can mention that to AC, but also contact ordinance enforcement (city hall may be able to guide you who to call for code violations).
You don’t. You move on with your life. It sucks, I get it. But as much as you don’t like this family or the fact that the cat is now theirs, you have no actual evidence of abuse or neglect. The cat probably was scared and uncomfortable when you saw her - she had only been in the new home 1 week and probably was still getting used to everything. The mom making a noise that startled the cat sounds like a stupid thing to do, but it doesn’t rise to the level of abuse. And now that they have cut off contact with you, you have no way to get any evidence of neglect of abuse.
