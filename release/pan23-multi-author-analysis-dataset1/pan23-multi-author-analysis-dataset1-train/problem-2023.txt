None of us know what she'd choose. But the law might keep you from disappearing with your kids, if your ex fights for visitation or whatever. Even when there's an order of protection between the parents, visitation is allowed (there's places that facilitate safe handover for example, and centers where supervised visitation takes place).
No wait, it is him and his brother. I could request that the grandpa put the brother as part owner upon his death... But no... that wouldn't work... my ex could easily convince his brother to sell it to him and bribe him....... I don't blame his brother because he is very broken as well (like major depression and doesn't give a shit about anything/ obviously). Um...but my ex doesn't think, so I could easily record his behavior and keep a restraining order until I could come up with a way to get rid of the property... this is so complicated.. I just wish so badly that he were not so crazy... I wish he could just enjoy his new life with his new girlfriend and make his new family... but even after having all of that he would "never leave me alone. .
... I could just request that I get the whole property if he dies and that way my babies have a safe place to live and my babies' grandma wouldn't have to choose between my children and her own... But she has already stated that she chooses my children over her own because the are "innocent". But that is a blatant lie, no?
