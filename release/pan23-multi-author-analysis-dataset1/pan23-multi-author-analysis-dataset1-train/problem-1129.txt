To a certain extent, this may be biological - even today, it's noted in medical studies that women have a higher tendency to pass out. "" (van Dijk and Weiling) in the Journal of Physiology, 2009 sifts through a number of physiological differences between men and women that could play a part but ultimately makes no definite conclusion on the matter.
John Singer Sargent's Repose. Her eyes are open in this one, so she's not asleep. But she's either really tired or really bored.
It also causes body temperature fluctuations, and increases dehydration. All of this happens during elevation changes, so sitting up from a prone position, standing up from sitting, even using an elevator or during take off/landing while flying, as air pressure, including weather changes, and physical elevation can cause symptom flares. All of this also leads to mood fluctuations, as effectively the body is quickly changing from "normal" to a "fight-or-flight" response, and this will definitely impact ones emotions.
Thank you! I don't think Repose depicts a faint (the original title, Nonchaloir, relates to nonchalance/indifference, which implies that she's chilling), but the other three are inarguably syncope.
