You’re n idiot. She committed a crime, which is not only illegal in Russia but federally illegal in the US. She plead guilty, she is wrong in every way. She is getting released because she has some celeb status. How in any way did she deserve to be swapped?
This is just dumb decision, even with Griner kind of guilty in crossing russian draconian laws, Russian police was always positive in tossing drugs right into people pockets just to arrest them and complete their “investigation plan” (Golunov case as example).
Thank god. If even one LGBTCutiepie is harmed in this world, it's one too many. One LGBTQ Life is worth the 1000's of straight people who die in the next wave of terror attacks that are quaranteed to happen by releasing the Arms Dealer. Thank god one less Lesbian will be minorly inconvenienced for breaking the laws of a foreign Country, and not have to atone for her crimes and sins. She wanted to act gangster, and she ficked around and found out, but Daddy Biden saved her just like she expected.
