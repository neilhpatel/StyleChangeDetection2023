Beyond that, the other gold-standard historical podcaster in my (and likely most peoples’) eyes is Mike Duncan. He made “the History of Rome” from 2007-2012 (roughly 200 episodes from the mythical founding to the fall of the Western Empire). Since then, he started another show “Revolutions” which is broken up into seasons each covering a different revolution (American, French, Haitian, etc.). That one is still going. He’s about to start the Russian Revolution.
Hi there anyone interested in recommending things to OP While you might have a title to share, this is still a thread on /r/AskHistorians, and we still want the replies here to be to an /r/AskHistorians standard - presumably OP would have asked at /r/history or /r/askreddit if they wanted non-specialist opinion. So give us some indication why the thing you're recommending is valuable, trustworthy, or applicable Posts that provide no context for why you're recommending a particular podcast/book/novel/documentary/etc, and which aren't backed up by a historian-level knowledge on the accuracy and stance of the piece, will be removed.
The Fall of Rome is an excellent podcast. Patrick Wyman, the host, has a PhD (awarded in 2016) in late Roman history with a specialty in the late Roman economy, and he not only weaves a fantastic narrative, he also brings the historiography and debates into that narrative in such a way that it just flows very nicey.
