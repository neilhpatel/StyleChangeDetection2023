To be fair, the official church has reformed somewhat. But the original church doctrine commanded men to take many wives, and, the younger and more impressionable, the better. Child brides were the norm. Lots of followers of Mormonism today reject the reforms and still follow Joseph Smith’s original edicts regarding this. You should read John Krakauer’s book Under the Banner of Heaven.
The point isn't 'everyone should have gender-affirming surgeries as teens', and that isn't what transgender people or the modern consensus on medical standards of care for trans people are arguing for - the point is that Republicans don't even believe their own lies about why they are going after any and all kinds of trans healthcare.
Yeah. This is exactly the weird creepy crap that highlights how this is all about hurting trans kids just to hurt them, and has nothing to do with "saving the children".
