Yes I consented to medical treatment for my preeclampsia and csection I did not submit myself to an investigation of my parental fitness. If consenting to treatment upon admission at a hospital means giving up your right to make decisions for yourself, noone would ever go to the hospital. Drug testing me for the purpose of reporting me if I failed the test is not medical treatment when the intention was to determine the necessity of legal intervention on my parental rights. if it is to be considered an aspect of my treatment I don't know why drug testing would be the exception to informed consent.. i would think that Drug testing my daughter is treatment since it is her well being that would have been compromised if I had exposed her to something while pregnant.but can't understand why its ok to violate woman's right to decide what is done to her at a hospital. Its a hospital. Not jail.
Doctors and nurses use many different tools and techniques to assess patient stability, comfort and health and to treat things that may impede said stability, comfort and health, including tests for drug exposure.
It wasn't for anything like that. I was recovering from a csectiom amd They tested me and my daughter to see if I did anything while pregnant that would be reportable to cps. I mean if it was prior to the surgery and only me that was tested..maybe. but no the purpose was not medical.
