For those unfamiliar with Russian, "mir" means peace and Earth and was the name of their long orbiting space-station. Reagan proposed we name ours "freedom" in response, but what eventually got made with partnerships was the ISS "International Space Station".
Unfortunately yes. If Ukraine started doing this to Russia they would lose the moral high ground and probably western support. Also Russia would not hesitate to use nukes.
Professional soldiers are important. They understand how to not freeze to death in winter, how to operate AA guns, etc.
The expectations? Hot knife through butter. If Russia was half as strong as anyone suspected, the war would be over in a month. However, here we are - relatively stable frontline, several successful counteroffensives, and some newsworthy behind-the-lines action. Opponents are proven to be somewhat equal - Ukraine doesn't even get the shiniest NATO toys, while Russia is forced to collaborate with N-Korea and Iran (not really the most advanced states out there).
