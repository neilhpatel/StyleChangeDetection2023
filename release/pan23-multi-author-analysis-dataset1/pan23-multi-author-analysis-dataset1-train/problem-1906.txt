Not really. I’m a war between US and China, sure the US wins. But if China were to attack Taiwan, they have a substantially bigger fleet in the region. By the time the rest of the Us navy makes it there, Taiwans probably already captured (based on almost every war simulation ever) …if you’re not counting nukes. At that point every can change.
I didn’t realize we operated normal aircraft carriers, I thought they were helicopter carriers (although they do only carry fixed wing aircraft with V/STOL capability) turns out the America class LHA has a greater displacement than the Charles de Gaulle.
No it’s not. But that’s the paradox of war, if you stop building weapons someone might take advantage on this and attack you. So you keep building weapons just to be sure but your enemies keep building weapons as well because you’re building them and at some point everybody has so many weapons and feels so safe because of them that they think they would win the potential war, so they go to war and suddenly you have war even though you thought your weapons would protect you from any war.
Almost but not quite. Chinese Navy never had serious battlefield experience with their navy whereas US Navy experienced multiple battles over the years. Quality of crew can be decisive factor in any battle.
