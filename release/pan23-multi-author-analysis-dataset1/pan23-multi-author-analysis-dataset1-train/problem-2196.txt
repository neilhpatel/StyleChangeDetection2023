In mid-1941, Hitler provided what Herwig describes as the "clearest definition to date of his ultimate plans concerning the United States", but I would say that they are more illustrative of how vague they remained at that point. Coming from a discussion between Raeder and Hitler, the Naval War Staff diary recorded:
Weinberg, Gerhard L. Germany, Hitler, and World War II: Essays in Modern German and World History. Cambridge Uni Press, 1995.
Yes, once, it went terribly, like many other Nazi HUMINT efforts under Admiral Canaris(who would eventually die in a concentration camp for his anti Nazi activities) and Abwher, though building on similar efforts in WW1(see the Black Tom bombing of munitions in New York Harbor in 1916).
(P.S. The documentary in question is Ken Burns' The War, and reading these answers will give you a good idea of just how much to trust it. :/ ).
If we want to speculate on how Germany might have ramped up direct pressure on the American mainland, the rudimentary plans for the Amerikabomber is perhaps the best to look at if we want something concrete, even if that too never made even close to the production stage of development.
I ask out of complete ignorance. Does the non-translation of Volk almost editorialize the content as it suggests that the intent of the phrase "german people" means ethnic german/nazi/Arian/etc, whereas using the word "people" doesn't color the translation?
