The Germans were certainly aware of foreign tanks arriving in the USSR, and having already seen the Sherman at El Alamein in 1942 they had a head start of almost a year before encountering them in the east. Instructions sent out to German anti-tank crews on the Eastern Front in 1942 include diagrams of Sherman tanks, although it's very clearly the M4A1 with direct vision ports, the kind that would have been encountered in North Africa.
Thanks! Just one bit of clarification as someone very not-well-versed in tanks: why were there both 75 and 76mm gun variants in the first place? What did either offer over the other?
Fascinating. The Tiger thing is pretty intriguing, I was wondering if I could quote you on that and if the Shermans' favorable outcome had to do with superior mobility compared to the Tigers, or if it was just using the terrain and ambushing.
Not that I'm aware of. It was not recommended to transfer them to even the domestic agricultural sector. Some ended up as prime movers at military installations.
Very interesting. Do you have any insight into the reverse engineering efforts on the German tanks to develop these refurbishment facilities?
