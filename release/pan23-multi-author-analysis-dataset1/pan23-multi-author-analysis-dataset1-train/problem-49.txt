Was it love at first sight? Did Eros sting you with love’s deadly poison? Have Aphrodite’s fair charms brought together star-crossed lovers?
Certainly. The extent to which it still wouldn't be a great translation of the concept would perhaps be the extent to which labor markets for women are more competitive. As exploitative and demeaning as the labor market today can be, Chrysis' alternative to pleasing Demeas was either someone just like Demeas or an entirely different level of abuse than is normative.
Hey, thanks for the great answer! I wanted to follow some of your reference links, but unfortunately I think they're broken. I didn't check all of them, but at least these three lead to error pages.
Since others have discussed other romantic ventures that were available outside of marriage, and it’s such a massive topic to cover, I thought I might focus on how conventional relationships surrounding marriage would work, and how someone could go from an admirer to husband following from what you asked in the question.
Thanks! I have fixed the link rot I could find and left more interpretable plain text citations to make the puzzle easier on myself when the links eventually die again.
