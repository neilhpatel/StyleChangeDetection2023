The lizards all together with everything that I've spent on them would be around $500 or more one of them was $50 and the other one was $250. And yeah that's why I'm trying to do right now I'm trying to lay low follow the rules and just save as much as I can without having a job doing odd jobs on the side to try and move out until I can actually get a job but they just freak out over the tiniest things and blow things out of proportion all the time. Even if it's something I didn't even do and they just happened to be mad and need someone to take it out on I'm the person that they go to to take it out on, thanks I just wanted to know my legal rights if it did come to that I figured that's something I could do but it wasn't sure.
Here's the rub. Even though you're an adult, you're still living with your parents and they're providing the majority of your needs. They aren't likely ever going to treat you like an adult in those sort of circumstances. They hold all the cards here. If you want to continue to receive those benefits, you need to be cooperative with their demands even if you don't think they're reasonable. From my perspective, though, is if you live rent free, free meals, etc. and all they do is expect you to keep a clean room, that's a fucking great deal.
