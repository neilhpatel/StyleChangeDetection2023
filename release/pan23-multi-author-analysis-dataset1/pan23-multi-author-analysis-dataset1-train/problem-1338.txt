They can't force you to only cash your check at their bank. This is definitely a sign that something is wrong at the company. I remember, years ago, we'd get our paychecks distributed and then see the head of finance rush out the door at lunchtime to make a deposit, apparently to fund the issued checks before employees cashed them that day. We all started cashing our checks at the company's bank to be safe. Soon after, someone from the IRS showed up at the office and wanted to padlock the doors because the employers was not paying the IRS the taxes deducted from our paychecks.
Definitely! For the time being, I’ve scanned each check I’ve deposited just in case; I thought it seemed a little strange at first and wanted to cover my bases. After reading some of the other comments though, I’m a little hesitant to mobile deposit for the sole reason to avoid any fees if a check were to bounce. We’ll see though… I’m hoping they get it together; at this point it seems like they’ll either go back to direct deposit soon, or go under by Christmas lol. Hopefully it’s the former, but I’m prepared for the latter¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
