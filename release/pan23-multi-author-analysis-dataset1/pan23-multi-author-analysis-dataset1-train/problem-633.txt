There may have been several legal things you could have done to rectify the situation other than speed 30% over the limit, understanding that speeding 30% over the limit was likely the most immediate and least mildly inconvenient (but still illegal) way to not get off-course for a moment.
Ok, thank you for explaining it. It makes more sense now and I know I was in the wrong. I’m already taking a defensive driving course for the first one, and I’ll try and see if there’s any way to get another deffered adjudication. Hopefully it works out, crazy that all this is happening all at once. Thank you for the help!
You can call the court ahead of time and inquire about any deferred adjudication or probationary programs that may be available (understanding that since you've already done that you may be ineligible for another ticket so soon), hire an attorney to angle for the most favorable outcome possible (which may be more expensive than the ticket in the short-term, but save on insurance hikes and points on your license in the long-run), or just pay the ticket and plead guilty.
