So, the Russians blow up NS 1 at about the same time they were saying NS 2 was open for business to Europe. Also, the same time Germany and Europe were in the midst of weaning off the Russian teat. The plan was to use the very old school "Takeaway" close. With high anxiety in Europe and Germany about winding down their dependence, then seeing their primary source of energy blown up would make them feel they had to get remaining gas through NS2, and at increased volume in panic as their primary source was gone, and what happens if NS 2 gets blown too? Then they have no source of NatGas.
Ahh...so Russia has a history of blowing up their own stuff and blaming others in order to create certain perceptions that help them push their message, they have the means to blow up the pipeline, they are positioned in the appropriate area, with the appropriate equipment necessary to perform this operation. They're observed in that area with this equipment during the timeline of events leading to this explosion. And your conclusion is that everything lines up with the US doing this?
