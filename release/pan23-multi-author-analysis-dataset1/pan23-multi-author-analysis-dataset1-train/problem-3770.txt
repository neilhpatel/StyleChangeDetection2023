In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. And the court run by Justice Handmaid, Justice Boof, and Justice Klan robes have thrown the right to privacy right out of the door with Dobbs and they're all gunning to eliminate this ruling too, hell Justice Pubic Hair literally released a statement saying this was his goal.
No. It was not law. Roe v Wade was a Supreme Court opinion. It was not a law passed by Congress and signed by the President. SCOTUS created the interpretation that suggested abortion was a constitutional right. The issue is that over time, interpretations can change. That is especially true when someone isn't specifically mentioned in the Constitution. The word "abortion" does not appear in the Constitution. Neither does "medical privacy" neither does "Reproductive rights." Guns? That's there. Free speech? That's there. Free exercise of religion? That's there. Abortion? It's only there if you interpret it a certain way.
