The Japanese constitution prohibits a standing offensive military, but they have the ability to change their own constitution without approval from anyone (it was originally written by the US occupying forces after WWII).
This. They have the ability and could make one honestly in under a month to be fair. But they are vastly anti-nuke as having to see the aftermath first hand. It's literally an end of the line type move.
Insofar as ship driving, military discipline, maintaining their equipment, basically anything associated with executing a standard procedure, they were phenomenal by comparison.
I mean... Number one is always number one. And it ain't fuckin' China either, that's for sure. In 1990-91, Iraq had the 5th largest army in the world. It was reduced to a fraction of itself, in 100 hours. Rankings don't really mean anything, except in reference to how capable the US projects an opponent to be, because it's really all in a scale of who is the next best to the US military, which is tactically superior to most of the other countries in the world's militaries, combined.
Originally, yes, but not so much at this point. The post-war treaties have all been replaced with various mutual defense treaties with the US (among other nations). Japan could choose to build an offensive military at this point, but it would require changing their constitution.
