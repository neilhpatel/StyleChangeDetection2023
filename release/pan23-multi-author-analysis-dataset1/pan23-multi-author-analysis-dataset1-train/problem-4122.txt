Despite no longer being general secretary, Jiang still remained in charge of the military during the first year of Hu Jintao's term.

They are doing OK? At least in the big cities. There's a difference between outlook and current status quo. Economic activities that generate cash flows are still going the same, paper money perhaps not so much. I've always told my relos off hand to sell up and move abroad if possible. Too much wealth tied up in real estate sitting under a huge demographic bomb.

Does democracy brings prosperity or prosperity eventually leads to democracy? Examples abound of all kind of results and democracy is not the constant in the get rich cohort. China follows Taiwan and Singapore's authoritarian path.2 (When Taiwan grew the fastest and not riding the coattails of China, was under KMT authoritarian rule, democracy was a recent development). You can only compare each leader with the period before them and Jiang's years were transformative, miraculous even. Much is attributed to Deng though his work is be the champion of change. Deng himself only took small incremental steps towards opening up, eg when private enterprises were first allowed, the size was limited to no more than 6 people! It was really a low low base that China emerged from in the 80s.
