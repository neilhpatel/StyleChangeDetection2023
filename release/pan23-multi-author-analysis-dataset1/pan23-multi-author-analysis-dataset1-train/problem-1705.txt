Yeah, AZ being a right to work state, her employers wouldn't really need a good reason to terminate her employment. She's focused so much on the reason of her reprimand that she doesn't see that sending the message was undoubtedly unethical. Also, I laughed pretty hard when I read "get stroppy about it".
The reason I was blunt about the fact your wife has nobody to blame here nor cover, either socially or legally, is because if you read your post from a neutral perspective, it is a lot of blaming other people and making disparaging comments about them, and it comes off very much as if you are trying to shift responsibility for problems off of your wife and make it entirely other people's doing. This is also not something necessarily bad; I am sure my husband does it in describing less-than-brilliant things I do and I am sure that everyone else does unless they really like marital strife. It's just important to recognize that what anyone else did, including her manager in asking about employees, is not relevant here, and the only thing that matters is that you wife did something that caused disruption in the workplace, and has no legal cover based on what anyone else may or may not have done/said/etc.
Yep, it's not pretty. She realized that was wrong as soon as she hit send in the message. I agree it's actionable, but more for perpetuating the issue after she was already reprimanded, not violating a social media policy that wasn't in place. Had she not messaged Karen, this would have all ended with Henrietta asking Wifey to not talk about her and Managers reprimand of Wifey. The message was undoubtedly a bad decision and not ethical.
