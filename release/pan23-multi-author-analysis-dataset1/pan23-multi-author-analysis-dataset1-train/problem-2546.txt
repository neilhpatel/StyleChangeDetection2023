It seems that the average citizen used either the demonym of his state ("Virginian", "South Carolinian") or used "Confederate." Mary Chesnut and J. B. Jones, a War Department clerk, used it that way. Though it seems that they used it more as a descriptive related to the government and armies of the Confederacy rather than to refer to people. I can't find a single mention of "confederate man", "confederate woman", or them referring to themselves as "confederates", bu plenty of "Confederate soldiers", "Confederate ports", "Confederate bills." "Southern" seems to be also widely used.
Unfortunately no. The dogs name was Ulla, a 4 month old German Shepard puppy intended as a gift to Späh's children. She was housed in a cargo hold at the rear of the end of the airship. Späh would visit her multiple times during the journey, in violation of the rule that passengers weren't to move around the interior unescorted. Ulla perished in the fire.
