For malpractice to have occurred you must prove there was negligence, that a professional duty was owed to you, a breach of such duty occurred, that there was injury caused by the breach, and there were resulting resulting damages. A doctor investigating your complaints with diagnostic testing to the best of their ability within their scope of practice and failing to find a cause of your symptoms does not meet criteria for breach of their professional duty assuming the doctor followed reasonable standards of care based on their training.
Thanks for the info. Theoretically, if I requested a copy of my medical records, and a third party Dr. reviews it, and they find that it was something that should have been within their scope of training. Would that then constitute as sufficient negligence? However unlikely the scenario?
Just FYI you can take your bag of worms to your dog's vet, they will have no problem telling you if they are worms and also what type of worms they are. My vet charges less than $10 for that.
