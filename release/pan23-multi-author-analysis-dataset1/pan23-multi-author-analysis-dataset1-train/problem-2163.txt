The whole reason we have all the rules and why we [delete] a large amount of stuff is because we don't want to be like r/AskReddit where the post outright asks "Doctors of Reddit" and then the replies are all "Not a doctor but" sort of thing. We want to cultivate an environment where experts actively want to contribute and not feel like they're wasting their time. We don't want to be yet another place where the hot meme of the day gets all the upvotes, which it inevitably does in other subreddits with loose moderation.
Another non-historian here. Non historians can write an answer at any time, be flaired, become a mod, come to conference. We don't ask education or background, just (from historians and non historians) they write accurate and in-depth+comprehensive answers.
We have, in fact, got a lot of those. All of mine, for instance - by no possible definition am I a historian. A lot of other flairs and moderators aren't even in academia, have a history degree, or qualify for the label. (Unless we specify public historian, but that doesn't let me go on and on about how unqualified I am.).
