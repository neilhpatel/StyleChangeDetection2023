What's happening to the UK as a whole just now happened to Scotland in the 90s and 2000s already. SNPs rise didn't happen overnight and wasn't due to the independence thing (that came as a result of everything going on). Its because Labour lost practically every young voter with cuts to education closing whole schools, with many having arts and music's wiped off the curriculum. Hospital closures and a growing drugs endemic as entire regions were developmentally abandoned.
Yes and no on the Russia bit. The opportunism goes back way before the invasion of Ukraine, the latter of which I think was part of Putin's long-term plan. He's been doing what he can to stoke political turmoil in the West and cause as many fractures as he can. Russian social-media influence campaigns have been on-going for years, and played some role in promoting Brexit. (And remember which president of which country the former POTUS tried to extort by holding up military aid. That can't be just a coincidence.).
It would really help if we actually tried to fix things, make ourselves energy self sufficient, stop the absolute train wreck that is Brexit, tax companies properly, work on theproblems within the NHS etc etc etc.
