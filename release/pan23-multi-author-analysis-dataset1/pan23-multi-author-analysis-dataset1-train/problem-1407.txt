I mean, if the Haitians dont want us THERE and are attacking embassy convoys, doesnt seem like we should be there. Last i checked, Haitians really do not like the US. If we arent doing anything to help them other than having an embassy there for political reasons maybe itd be smarter just to leave. But im not politician.
Right, but as of this moment Haiti isn't exactly a "country" - regardless of who's responsible, the fact is that the government is essentially non-functional (some would argue they have no real government: they don't even have a President since the last was assassinated), gangs basically run the place, and the country is generally up in flames, with a cholera plague still ongoing.
Itâ€™s not alway obvious, or quick. It can take time and the change can be incremental. But, in hindsight, one can find the point of no return.
Even if Haiti was hostile to America, it isn't, maintaining diplomatic contact is the lowest level way of easing tensions and maintaining intergovernmental communication.
