Dude you're getting a lot of conflicting info here and it's very interesting that people don't seem aware of the acknowledgment or assertion of paternity process which exists in almost every state.
3. Keep living in Alaska, hire a lawyer in Illinois where she and the kid live, get an order for visitation and with that an order for child support. Now because you haven’t been in the kids life, the order is most likely going to be limited with no overnights to start with so you can start to build a relationship (heavily dependent though, but it is a possibility). Because you are in Alaska it becomes prohibitively expensive to build that relationship and you are now paying child support for a kid you can’t ever see or have custody of.
6. Working with the state to assert paternity and seek testing is the first step in obtaining visitation or any kind of relationship with the child. Knowing of course that you are a volunteering for child support in this process. And that child support is legally understood to be the right of the child to receive, not the right of the custodial parent. So it may have little or nothing to do with how much she makes or doesn't make, or who else is or isn't supporting this child.
