This is not to say that male rape of enslaved men never happened. Claims of sexual abuse of enslaved men by their male enslavers certain can be found in the record, but they are fairly rare. To some degree of course, this reflects what people were willing to write down. It is no coincidence that some of the most common such mentions are found specifically in abolitionist literature, but others too wrote down incidents, such as the Anglo-Jamaican planter Thomas Thistlewood who recorded in his diary the “Report of Mr. Watt Committing Sodomy with his Negroe waiting Boy”. But it is also important to reflect that these reports don't tie the behavior specifically to punishment, and simply follow similar patterns seen with the sexual violation of enslaved women, and while they fit within a complex expression of power and a means of instilling terror, they simply were not tied to instances such as the 'bucking' of John Glasgow. Such rapes and assaults were, while perhaps known or at least rumored, nevertheless done privately, whereas the punishment administered during 'bucking' was a very public spectacle, not only intended to break the single man being punished, but to be a reminder to all.
Thank you for the thoughtful answer. I can see why it would be difficult to pinpoint the origin of a idea mostly spread through oral history and blog posts.
