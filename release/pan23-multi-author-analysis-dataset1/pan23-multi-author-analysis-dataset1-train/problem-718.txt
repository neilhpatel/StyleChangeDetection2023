If you're interested in a particular bill that will benefit you in some way, it likely has to go through the entire process before it actually becomes a law. There are a few exceptions -- some House bills do not need approval of the Senate, and vice versa. But those are typically procedural and not directly impacting the actual statutes that govern US Federal law.
When a case involves federal and state laws, then the federal system (including circuit courts and US SUpreme Court) applies only to the extent necessary to address the federal questions. The federal court will apply the state law of the state the court sits in for any issues that aren't federal.
If a case originates in a state court, regarding legal matters of state law, that state's law will be used. the ultimate arbiter of the legal questions will be that state's Appellate courts.
Even the US Supreme court will defer to a state's appellate system, when a case involves issues of state law -- except where US constitutional matters or other federal laws supersede.
