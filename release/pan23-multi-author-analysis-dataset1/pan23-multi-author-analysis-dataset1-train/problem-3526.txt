There was one exception to the general lack of Kingly authority and that was "The Pale," a fairly small area centered around Dublin. By the time of Henry VIII's reign nearly all of the lords who actually bothered to participate in the Irish parliament came from this area. It's also worth noting that this is long before any kind of democracy. There isn't even a house of commons in the Irish parliament in this era. The parliament was composed only of the aristocratic landowning class and represented only the aristocratic landowning class. Common people had little to no say in what parliament did and there's no reason to think its decisions represented any kind of popular opinion. Initially Anglicanism was hardly adopted by anybody but the types of men who would've been in parliament and their families. It was largely confined to the Pale and only in Dublin itself does it seem to have been generally adopted by anyone in the lower classes.
Interesting. Anglicanism as a whole is the second largest denomination on the island, but that has more to do with Anglicans living in the republic more than NI I'm guessing?
