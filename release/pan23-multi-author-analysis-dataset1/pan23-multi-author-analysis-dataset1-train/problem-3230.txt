I work for one of the big pharmacy chains and the next step up from our pharmacy manager is the regional pharmacy leader (may not be the exact same title at the other chains, but there's most likely a similar regional position that oversees the individual pharmacy managers). You could try asking someone at your pharmacy for that person's contact information, or call another local store in the same chain, ask for their manager, explain that you had a problem with the manager at your location, and ask how to escalate the issue.
NAL. However, I work in the healthcare field. OP should ask for a print out of their medication fill history. Unless there’s a state law or something, I’m pretty sure the pharmacy is required to give it to you. The print out will show the dispensed quantity for each fill. People often get printouts at the end of the year for tax purposes or even when they’re seeing a new doctor and want them to know what meds they are on. I agree with a previous commenter’s suggestion to call your insurance company and ask how many tablets were billed for each fill.
