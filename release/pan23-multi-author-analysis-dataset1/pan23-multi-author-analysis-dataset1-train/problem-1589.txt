I saw a statement about slavery "No matter how bad you were taught slavery was, it was much worse than that". The more I see of the world, the more certain I am that this is true.
Especially when the law "bans teaching anything that assumes “fault, blame, or bias should be assigned to race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin, or to members of a race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin because of their race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin.”.
Oh… I just got it.. I have been racking my brain trying to figure out why anyone would give a shit about stuff from almost 200 years ago… their identification is with those people. It was the last “heroes” their area produced that they could claim relation to _because they themselves haven’t done anything_. You can’t proudly lay claim to being the grandson of notable South Carolinian Andy McDowell… best you could do is maybe being distantly related to Chadwick Bosema… oh I see their problem….
