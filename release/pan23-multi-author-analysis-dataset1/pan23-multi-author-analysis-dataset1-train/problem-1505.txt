Someone else commented this on a similar thread and I think it’s pretty prescient for this moment too:
Regular ordinary citizens prefer autocratic model? Regular ordinary citizens want to have iphones, drive mercedeses, eat sushi, drink hennesseys. Nobody wants to be visited and tortured for a five-year-old post about some public official's bribe.
Nice misinformation. The US forced the Pakistanis to attend peace talks and said India needed to attend them too, and if it wasn’t going to, the US wasn’t going to let it use its technology. Hardly unreasonable. The fact that you leave out that the US did the same thing to Pakistan shows you’re either ignorant or a victim of nationalist propaganda.
Essentially nothing honestly. It adds very little soft power to Ukraine. Because the vote was public more neutral countries like India can’t take actions that actively take actions that directly support the Russian invasion without getting called out. So India can buy oil and sell clothing to Russia but can’t sell off road transport trucks without more backlash then they would prior.
