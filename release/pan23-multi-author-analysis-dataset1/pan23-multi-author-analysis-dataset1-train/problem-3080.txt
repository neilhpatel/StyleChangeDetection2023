I'm old enough to remember the pressure to support the Iraq war. "If you're not with us you're with the terrorists.".
There were enough people both within the US government and random citizens vilifying and calling for the rounding up of non vaccinated citizens for forced vaccinations or even imprisonment during covid that I 100% believe that if the political winds were to swing hard enough, the US would start rounding up and murdering dissenting citizens.
Good stuff. You hit a double whammy. Glossed over every comment I made, and did not give a single example how I "insulted" them. You listed a difference between us and if you're implying us having a right to vote and being critical of our government is an insult i don't think you understand what an insult is. But we can talk about our right to "vote" where we are having that slowly eroded by gerrymandering, an entire party that if they lose attempt to discredit and deny the validity of this right, a Supreme Court that none of us voted for have set back woman's rights, a party that is trying to eliminate already cast mail in ballots for any reason they can. Which has had success in PA already. So yeah, right to vote.
The corrupt police in America, only target random individuals and an inconsistent reaction to the slightest resistance they face.
US Police: you resist or say something they don't like AFTER choosing a random person, they'll overreact dangerously.
