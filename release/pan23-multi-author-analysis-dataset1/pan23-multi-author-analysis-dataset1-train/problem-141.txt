Duh. Re-read what you're saying. The only thing not certifying an election does is get your county embarrassed, get your career ruined with possible jail time, and makes sure that less and less ppl vote Republican. 9 out of 10 ppl respect democracy and don't want crazies taking office. Did you see the midterm results?
That irrelevant. There is no law that requires that. IIRC, Cochise doesn’t even have on site tabulators. All the votes get counted at a central location. So there’s no way to count them all on election night. I think it took them several days to count the relatively small number they had.
