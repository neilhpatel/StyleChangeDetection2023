At first blush, Roman anatomical swearing was also pretty similar to our own. Their dirty lexicon included close parallels (on both meaning and usage) to shit, piss, asshole, cunt, and dick. What’s interesting are the Roman swears that don’t have direct parallels in modern English and vice versa.
One Roman swear that doesn’t appear in English is a vulgar term for clitoris. On some level, it seems like this should be an obvious go-to: we have swears for nearly every other piece of sexual anatomy, so why not that one? But get into a bar fight and insult your opponent with “You know what, you’re a fucking clit!” and you’ll get nothing more than confused looks. Why?
I mean homophobia wasn't really a thing, but being a bottom was socially unacceptable and lesbians were considered very suspicious. Different world, different biases.
Great answer. If I can ask: do we find references to the enlarged clit legend in medical literature (Galen, Soranos of Ephesus etc..) as well? I mean, they believed in the wandering womb and all, so I wouldn't be surprised.
