Pretty much. My wife may not like the way I word it, but it is true. In the eyes of our government (and our own marriage since our ceremony had no mention of talking sky daddies), it is a legally binding contract between two individuals that offers feature of ease of dealing with life insurance, taxes and what not.
I am so freaking sick of this shit. I didn’t choose to be gay. People like her choose to believe in God. They choose to go to church and live their life by some stupid storybook. Gay people are fact. Religion is fiction. One is based on reality. The other is based on faith. My right to exist and have the same rights of everyone else in this country has absolutely nothing to do with your right to believe in a fairytale. Do you see us marching in our parades with signs that say “we hate Christians” No We don’t give a crap We just want to be treated like human beings The worst part about all of it is that this Jesus dude they are so obsessed with would hang out and care for prostitutes and disease ridden vagabonds. He loved everyone and preached about acceptance. And last time I checked, it was the Republicans and every other religious nut out there who are being arrested for molestation and child porn and lying and cheating and raping. It’s 2022. This needs to end.
