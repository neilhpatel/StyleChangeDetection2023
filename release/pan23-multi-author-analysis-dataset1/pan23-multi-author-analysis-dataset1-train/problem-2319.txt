Let's say for the sake of argument that there was enough political or popular will to force Churchill's government either to resign, or to entertain peace talks with the Axis during the height of the Battle of Britain. Britain accedes to Italian demands for an African settlement that cedes much of East Africa to Italy, and perhaps joint control of the Suez Canal as well as the demilitarization of the Mediterranean (Malta, Gibraltar, Alexandria, etc.). Germany demands recognition of the new Status Quo on the Continent, as well as some strategic naval bases in the Atlantic/N. America (perhaps Nova Scotia or the Falklands, or recognition of the incorporation of Iceland and/or Greenland into the Reich, or some combination thereof), and Britain, in turn, gets certain trade guarantees with the new German Sphere of Influence, and - crucially - extracts a German promise to repatriate all French POWs to Metropolitan France before the end of 1940 in a bid to revive the Entente at a future date.
It took so many lives and so much pain to learn this lesson the first time around, but I do fear we will have to keep learning it regardless.
