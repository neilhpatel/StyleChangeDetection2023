Of course, that didn't quite work because rich people are just as human as poor people, and that neglected the very real suffering of a very large portion of people (see the poor laws and the fact that for several years, Paris had the poor starving to death because they removed the only social safety net).
I agree. It's really easy to be annoyed at politicians for being spineless, or "flip-flopping", but actually we want that to some degree. Politicians are just going to chase whatever gives them power, and we can expect that and deal with it. It's a much tougher question what we do with the millions of citizens that actually want corrupt, immoral, fascists running things. Providing education and a better economic situation used to prevent people from giving in to fear, ignorance, and depravity, but now we've been sliding down those slopes for decades and I don't know how you all the sudden get people to vote for those and other things in their interests when they are already committed to fear and violence. We probably need actual leaders to bring people through this and articulate a vision of a better way, but people like that are in very short supply, if they can exist at all anymore.

Exactly. Ryan bowed out in 2018 and set himself up to be "sane" Republican to pick up the pieces after the Trump fever breaks. Skipping the 2024 convention only strenhens his play.
