More about the Congressional mandate to reuse as much of the Space Shuttle leftovers as possible which eliminated the possibility to design a new rocket from scratch.
Yes. I’m not entirely sure why the mission isn’t under the “Artemis” series of missions like the others but there will be one. Maybe because the mission is primarily ran by the contractor proving the lander (SpaceX) rather than NASA? But IDK.
I half convinced that this disclosure around NASA and other government funded science projects are just a psy-ops by the Medical and Pharmaceutical industries, and the Neo-Liberals to move the blame for the failure of American healthcare and social programs from them to the public funding that could actually help people.
That's it. It's not an Artemis mission, it's one of the milestones for the HLS (Human Landing System) contract SpaceX won. Still part of the Artemis program, but not a numbered Artemis mission by NASA.
The Artemis program is the moon landing missions. Gateway and SLS predate it and Gateway isn't even on the critical path for the currently planned missions. If Starship fails, at least Artemis III and IV fail, if not the whole program.
