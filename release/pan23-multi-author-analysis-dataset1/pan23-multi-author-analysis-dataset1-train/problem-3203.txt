NAL. Oof. I had an almost identical scenario, the downstairs neighbor was very mentally ill. You can contact the local PD and get public records of all the police complaints she's made, it'll be good to have those on hand, especially if a new officer responds so you can show she has a pattern of weird behavior. I would take those copies to your apartment manager, and show them detailed proof that you're being harassed, with frequency. In most leases a "right to live comfortably" or something like that exists, so they can boot you if you start harassing your neighbors. At least that's what worked for me. They sent a cease and desist kind of thing to the crazy neighbor for violating the good neighbor clause in our lease, and evicted her when she continued to harass and call the police on us. Again, NAL, just what worked for me.
Wisconsin's Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection has an landlord/tenant guide available online. They also have a phone number, email, and website. While I would first talk with your landlord or apartment manager about moving to another unit; you may want to explore your options with the DATCP regarding breaking your lease for personal safety (the psychosis with threats) and noise issues (the constant pounding from your neighbor is its own noise issue). Your city or county may also have additional tenant/landlord codes and even a department or agency, please explore these options.
