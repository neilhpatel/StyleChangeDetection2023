So let's try to build up a basic synthesis. "Materialism" in a general sense in history as well as philosophy is often paired with "idealism", a word that can sometimes lead people astray as we're accustomed to idealism as a synonym for optimism, altruism, hopefulness, etc. Here it simply means: do you think history is mostly driven by changes in how people think, believe, imagine, in their sense of selfhood or their conceptions of politics; or do you think historical change is mostly driven by the material world outside of the human mind, in our environments, our technologies, our systems of production, in our physical and embodied nature?
More recently, some historians have taken an interest in a field that has been called "big history", which seeks to broaden the materialist understanding of human history by resituating it within the physical history of the entire universe.
But that is only one situation. There are different situations like this for just about every historical subject. That's what makes giving you a specific answer very tough. I think it's less about finding a protocol or system that can be used universally, and more about nurturing a generation of students and historians with solid critical thinking skills. People that can compartmentalize different historical interpretations and consider them all. Often, the truth is a jumble of different sources, and our job as historians (professional, armchair, or aspiring) is to sort them out and find the most reasonable narrative.
