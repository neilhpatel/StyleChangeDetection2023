Second, if your current/temporary custody agreement states that you are to have 50/50 custody (according to one of your responses), then she is likely in violation of the agreement. This is not unusual with fights like this. Anger replaces good sense and you end up making the fight worse. Do not engage in the fight.
What I did was educate myself by reading the custody laws; finding the proper forms through the courts website (some which have thorough explanations about how, when and why to fill them out); speaking with the court clerk and resource center; calling around to tons of attorneys; and finding a low-cost legal aid provided by a local YMCA. After verifying that my income met the requirements, they scheduled a $20 consultation where the attorney was really helpful, and hopeful that I could win! This was after paying for a few consultations through high priced lawyers who basically said, “well, thats just how it is for infants, maybe you’ll get custody when she’s 2 or 3. For me to represent you it’ll cost about $7k, but don’t expect much.” This wasn’t acceptable to me. So I continued to read, research, reach out, and show up when I was allowed.
