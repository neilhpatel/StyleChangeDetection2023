On a side note, the only reason I can come up with why a contractor would possibly stop a utility repair crew would be for safety reasons. If it is the contractors fault, they will be on the hook to reimburse the utility for the outage time. And let me tell you, that can be crazy expensive, we are talking 100k+/minute if itâ€™s a big trunk line.
In addition to contacting ODOT file a complaint with PUCO (the Public Utilities Commission) -- you can do it on line and while public utilities commissions across the country are generally very good at convincing telecoms to do their jobs, it seem PUCO strikes a particular terror in telecom companies -- In the half dozen times I've had to pull that handle, I've never had to wait more than 48 hours and my last complaint I wound up with a voicemail with from someone up the executive ladder at the telecom generally groveling, explaining that "employees weren't consistently showing up for work (due to union shenanigans)". Service was restored the next day and I wound up with a credit for 1.5 months worth of charges.
