This post turned out to be much longer than I anticipated, so I split it up in two parts. Sources noted at the end of the second post.
The Iranian revolution seems to follow a kind of 20th century patterns of reactionary-revolutionary Islamic movements but it also has many unique and specifically Iranian characteristics. What's your view on the ableness of the Pahlavi as monarchs and the degree to which their (mis)rule served to delegitimize monarchy?
Excellent answer. As an Iranian, I truly commend your effort to stay as politically neutral as possible. Even today amongst Iranians it’s incredibly difficult to have conversations about the Pahlavi regime and early days of the Islamic regime and revolution without it devolving into a shouting match.
3. Thirdly, due to the two points mentioned above, there are going to be people who will disagree (vehemently) with my perspective. That's alright. My Persian is not what it used to be, and I rely mostly on the literature I had to read for a class I did back in undergrad. I'm going to focus specifically on the role of some specific socio-political actors during and before the Revolution: they include the merchant middle class known as the bazārīs, as well as other kinds of anti-monarchical opposition and finally, the role of the Shi'a clergy.
