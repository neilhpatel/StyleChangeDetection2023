These new National schools taught only through English, however schools had existed before this in the form of either fee-paying or "hedge schools" which taught literacy and numeracy to a population that certainly had some demand to learn the English language, possibly so that they could enjoy popular literature, as it is estimated the half of all men and 3 quarters of all women in Ireland before the eve of the famine worked in jobs where literacy was not an essential skill. Yet, in places, roughly 45% of the population were recorded as being literate in 1841, a consistent upward trend from 1790. In fact, pre famine Ireland had literacy rates nearly double that of the Iberian peninsula or Italy.
