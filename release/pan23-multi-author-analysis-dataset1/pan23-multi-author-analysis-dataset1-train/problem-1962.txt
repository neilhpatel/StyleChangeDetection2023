They built an entire fucking city in a decade to host it. 130Â°+ heat doing construction work, living in umsanitary situations? 6500 seems a bit low to me.
The most pathetic thing is how spineless the rest of the world's mild to nonexistent protest when Qatar spits and shits on their supposed most important principles and ideals and watch as shithole Qatar silences and oppresses the LGBT community, and spits on human rights and gets to backstab and betray all their promises that got them the world cup in the first place.
Guys, guys. Would you just stop talking about the massive human rights violations and just focus on a bunch of man children kicking a ball up and down a field? God.
Or, maybe we just collectively decide to ignore this event, and all other international sporting events, until the organizers realize that the only way forward is to hold these events exclusively in democratic nations.
Trump is a dumbfuck, he's not my guy. I am just trying to cope with the absolutely pathetic silence of the west even when human rights abuses and LGBT+ oppression is on display on the biggest most watched event in the world. It makes it that much more obvious that all the woke company PR campaigns are just bs for show because they would lose sales in the west, and has nothing to do with the ACTUAL MESSAGE, nothing to do with the VALUES and principles they're parroting, just like the general public, they make their noises in support of these causes only when convenient. They run away and shut their mouth while REAL LIFE application of oppression against LGBT is on STEROIDS on displau compared to where they live because "we want to focus on the football".
