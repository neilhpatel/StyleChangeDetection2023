My findings are such: vast majority of ships have had plain white, no-symbols on them sails. Examples, , , , such . There are also examples of ships having simple decoration on their sails like crosses and other simple geometric shapes, examples , , this with letters, this little more complex . There are also very few artwork showing very complex and beautiful images on sails, but honestly we can't be sure if that wasn't just artistic license in the drawing rather then copying the actual sail decor.

The famous map of has over half a dozen Portuguese ships depicted on it, and all of them have a red cross painted on the white sails.
Piri Reis' map from 1513 shows a number of ships along the Atlantic Ocean, and looking closely one can see that some of them have some elements painted on the sails, painted in red. The use of red paint makes sense, as it would be easy to see against the sail and even against the sky, making it highly distinguishable (that's also why Spain's flag is red and yellow, though it is from 1785).
