If they want you to go to the station, then tell them you don't feel comfortable without an attorney. If they just have a couple questions for you over the phone, it's probably not you they're looking at. If they start asking stuff you're not comfortable with, just tell them, "I'm sorry, I'm not comfortable with this conversation anymore and would like to speak to an attorney before I'm asked anymore questions.".
Get a lawyer, make sure you phone is locked with a pin or password or pattern, NOT with a biometric like face id or a fingerprint as they can force you to unlock it with biometrics, and if they try to guilt trip you for wanting a lawyer present then all the more reason to __GET A LAWYER__!
I second this. If I’m looking at someone as a suspect, I ask them questions in person. It’s extremely likely that they’re just trying to figure out who his dealer was. Narcotics investigators are trying to put away dealers/suppliers and can actually charge them with the death of your son. Should you decide to call them back, feel free to ask them what the questions are about before they ask anything.
