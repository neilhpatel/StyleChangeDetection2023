Now, to your question, how was the territorial encroachment across the continent a form of settler colonialism not just territory expansion?
Colonialism, and specifically settler colonialism, feeds on land. The early United States Indian policy, inherited from a pattern established by earlier settlers, used the threat of genocidal violence to remove indigenous peoples from their homes. A strategy of total war involving the indiscriminate murder of combatants and civilians alike, resource deprivation through intentional destruction of crops, homes, and food stores, and wide-scale indigenous slavery was used to punish those who denied U.S. claims to new land. When outright violence became difficult to justify legal battles went as high as the U.S. Supreme Court, but still forced removals continued, including the Five Civilized Tribes along the Trail of Tears. Many northern nations accompanied their southern neighbors to a foreign land across the Mississippi River. Oklahoma, too, was someone's home. The forced relocation of indigenous peoples in turn threatened to displace nations like the Osage, Quapaw, and Caddo. As more and more settlers streamed ever westward to satiate the need for more land, the United States was unwilling and unable to honor it's treaty promises to prevent settler encroachment across the Mississippi.
Thank you for pinging me. I think I will be able to make a response to this question as well, albeit not at this time since I've got some stuff to finish.
