It should be noted that Yukon and Quebec have already achieved $10/day child care. Quebec's system in particular has been in place since 1997, and costs $8.50/day. British Columbia has begun opening a significant number of $10/day centres, and all other provinces will have achieved some level of fee reduction by the end of this year, some by 50%.
Jesus. We bought a cheap house and didn’t upgrade our car after we got married. So thankfully, we were able to just have my wife be a stay at home mom. Second kid is due in March. Can’t imagine having to pay for two daycare bills - even if my wife went back to work.
exceptional heathcare. Only pain in the ass is i had to hand carry their entire medical record in a little book.
Historically immigration from many different countries has been a huge plus in diverse Western/New World countries unless mainstream economics is completely wrong or we’re dealing with an extremely supply constrained economy where every new adult/household is primarily another mouth to feed rather than another potential entrepreneur. Iirc all but the least educated immigrants are net pluses to the economy in the USA and Canada, even if none of them converge fully with old-stock Canadians when adjusted for education and urbanization.
