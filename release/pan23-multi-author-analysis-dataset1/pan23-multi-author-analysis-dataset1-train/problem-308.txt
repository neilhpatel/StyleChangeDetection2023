What Would Jesus Do? If you think it’s beat the shit out of police officers for trying to protect and serve this Country because some guy who grabs people by pussies and tells the public to ingest bleach suggested it, well then the Jesus you’re worshipping is a total moron, and so are you. But “we ain’t no sheeple” as we all wear the same hat our pussygrabber master told us to purchase. And maybe that’s what you get when you believe in a book with talking snakes and magic powers as reality. I wish people could start to worship critical thinking/logic/reason instead, but we’ve steered so far from that in recent years and everyone (on both sides of the isle too) are too much a snowflake to admit they’re wrong when they are and just feed themselves whatever advertising based confirmation bias media feeds them the dopamine they’re addicted to. To be “right” is to feel good, in a world, misunderstood. If you don’t see them selling that concept, you’ve got a blindfold on.
