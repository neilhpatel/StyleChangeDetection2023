My friend brought the dog to my house, his friend who owned the dog could not keep him anymore where they were living. When he brought the dog to my house yes it was only supposed to be temporary, after about 2 weeks of me having the dog is when I let my friend know that I could keep the dog, I live with my Mom & Stepfather so I had to talk it over with them first & I got the ok that I could keep the dog. I told my friend that I could keep the dog & asked to have his friend contact me so that him & I could handle the situation without my friend being the middle man. That never happened but the dog still remained with me. There was no agreement that I would board the dog or foster the dog for him, I was told he could not keep the dog anymore he was selling him & the dog was brought to my house & for a year I had him, the original owner never contacted me never came back for the dog until 4 1/2 weeks ago when I was told they found a female to breed him with.
You don't give a location but there's nothing you can do here. You willingly gave the dog back. Any claim you might've had you would have needed to assert earlier (but you likely had no claim, legally pets are property). There are plenty of dogs that need a loving home. (You can sue for the cost of the dog food, etc.).
It also sounds like your agreement with your Friend didn't involve any transfer of Ownership, although they may have been rather unfairly putting the cost of the Dog on you (although you did get to enjoy having the dog during that time, which could very well be considered a benefit on your end).
