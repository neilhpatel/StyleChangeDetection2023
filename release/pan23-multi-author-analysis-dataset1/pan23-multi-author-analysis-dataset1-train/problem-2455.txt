Camps at this point were not yet the death camps of the genocidal machinery that began its work in 1940/41. So, while there were not yet gas chambers in any of the camps at this point, since the Nazi Nuremberg Racial laws of 1935 it was quite clear that the regime had on its mind the utter isolation and expulsion of Germany's Jews. German government policy switched to one of destruction of all European Jewry and other declared enemies of the Nazi state only later, but camps already existed, and Jews were already treated horribly in many ways when Chaplin sat down to write his famous movie script through the second half of '38 into 1939.
At this point, German Jews had been declared non-citizens, tens of thousands had fled the country, the synagogues had been burnt in the so-called Kristallnacht, which is more aptly called the pogrom night, Austria had been annexed, another big concentration camp had opened there right away (Mauthausen), and as filming of The Great Dictator began in September, Germany invaded Poland.
You are right, my choice of words was inaccurate. What I meant with "concentration camps" were the infamous death camps starting with the Wannsee conference in 1942.
