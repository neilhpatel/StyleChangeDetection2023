And I can see where exposing & proving criminality may help some towards healing. Been doing a deep dive into Argentinian war crimes prosecutions since seeing Argentina 1985 (highly recommend!) So many victims & survivors wanted to be heard. To say what they'd suffered in a public tribunal, and to have a court say, "yes, these assholes are guilty of all this harm." There literally isn't enough punishment in the world to make up for systematic rape, torture, and murder - even execution or life in prison seems weak AF, compared to the crimes. BUT it still mattered to many victims in that case.
Honestly? It keeps perceptions focused. The reason you keep hearing this is that Ukrainians in particular are very used to the way that Russian propaganda is designed to dull your perception of a conflict in subtle and destructive ways.
ok, and then what? In practice international law doesn't exist for countries like US, Russia, China because no one would be willing to risk the consequences of trying to enforce such a courts decision.
