I just would note that the Arkansas escapees were probably not so much going to seek refuge with Indian communities as they were taking refuge in the Indian Territory (today's Oklahoma). The Bolton paper notes (p. 37) that the Cherokee Nation had a slave code not that different from Arkansas's. But as dramatized in True Grit, the Indian Territory was an expansive wilderness of scattered settlements and relatively little U.S. law enforcement or control, so to escaping slaves it represented a place with less danger of discovery or "extradition.".
Negro slaves constituted the single most numerous minority group among the Five Civilized Tribes from an early date, and by 1860 outnumbered alien whites in the Indian Territory by a ratio of more than three to one. The several thousand slaves at that date, and presumably earlier as well, were only owned by a small group. According to the manuscript census schedules, not quite 2.5% of tribal citizens and about 5% of alien white residents actually owned slaves. The slaveholding element constituted a tiny elite in the Indian society, but evidently one with disproportionate economic and political power. Contemporary reports on Indian life inevitably associated the families possessing slaves specifically with "easy" or "better" circumstances, in contrast with the mass of the populace who lived in grinding (but seemingly unconcerned) poverty. In the context of the slave-owning citizen families, literary evidence states that the wealthy parties were mixed both in blood and in cultural heritage.
