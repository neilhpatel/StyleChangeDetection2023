For South and South East Asia we have less reliable ways to date the arrival of this information as i talk about . It is highly likely that it was transmitted with the Portuguese arrival to the region. The news could have been conveyed through diplomatic and trade activities, through captured soldiers or renegades who turned sides, through numerous ambassadors and dignitaries who were sent to Europe and back, as well as slaves and captives who might had unwillingly done the same trip. In an effort to pinpoint at least some year, we can give year 1512 when the Portuguese governor of India Afonso de Albuquerque mentions seeing a Javanese map that shows among other things coast of Brazil. There is some serious debates on what this statement actually meant (as the map doesn't survive) but shows the strong likelihood that the new geographical knowledge was quickly disseminated and incorporated in Southeast Asia.
Thank you. That was very interesting. When did the association with Columbus's voyages and the discovery of the new world develope? I mean, why Columbus and not Vespuci?
