Thats not entirely true. His approval rating might hover around there but I'm sure most of those people would just vote for the republican nominee. As much as some of them love Trump they still mostly just want a republican. Trump is just sort of their favorite one. The question is how many of them are true believers who will vote for him even as a third party candidate. I'm just speculating but I bet that number is more like 10% percent. Still plenty enough to doom the republican ticket but all 30-40% ain't following him to a doomed candidacy. No chance.

Same. Others in a separate thread said it would ruin our political capital with the world if 30% of a party elected him, and I laughed because that damage is done. The primaries and trump elections say it all- those 30% are here, theyâ€™re stupid, and they vote.
