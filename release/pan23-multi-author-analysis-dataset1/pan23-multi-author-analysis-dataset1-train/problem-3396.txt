Since I have my sources up from the post on Marcher Lords, I’ll wade into this one! Again, disclaimer that I’m not as familiar with castle building/costs outside of Medieval Britain, and for this post I’ll be focusing specifically on Caernarfon and Beaumaris castles, two great Edwardian fortresses that were part of a system of castles Edward I commissioned during/after his conquest of Wales, and which were supposed to help pacify the perennially rebellious people of Gwynedd, or North Wales.
What about grain? Clark gives prices for barley, so let’s use that. (I’m completely ignoring any quality differences which might skew our results because I have no idea how to even begin measuring those.) He also gives bread prices, but I’m assuming bread varies in quality too much to be a good comparator. Barley is 0.4 shillings/bushel, and oatmeal is 0.169 pence/lb. So, in £, that’s 0.0333 £/bushel, and 0.0007 £/lb for oatmeal. Helpfully, the Assize of Weights and Measures Act was passed around 1300, so we can hopefully rely on the bushel being at least \approximately\ stable, though agricultural volume measurements are a rabbit hole you would need an entire separate post (and a different historian) to explain. Our £7000 castle could have bought us 210,000 bushels of barley. Modern Barley prices apparently vary quite a lot, but eyeballing some estimates at Farmlead.com, it seems to be somewhere around £4/bushel. Our castle, in terms of barley, is worth a measly £840,000, by far our lowest estimate so far. Also not surprising, as modern agriculture is overwhelmingly more productive than medieval agriculture.
I also look forward to a good response. Just wanted to add to the conversation that castles usually weren't built all in one go... sometimes they were built over hundreds of years; constantly being improved upon over the centuries. It took 20 years to build the Tower of London, but it was improved upon for 700 years.
