NAL. Whether you have access to the trust info varies by state. In California beneficiaries do have access so they can monitor and prevent waste. Have your prenup attorney request the info directly from the estate attorney who is managing the trust. It will cost more (since the attorney will charge you for their time) but since your grandparents & their attorneys arenâ€™t giving you the info you need to disclose in your prenup this would be most straight forward way.
3. If you use wording like "Any traceable proceeds of the four trusts granted by \[grantor(s)\] shall be exempt from matrimonial property division/equalization", will be sufficient in many jurisdictions to exclude the trust proceeds.
Perhaps you do, perhaps you don't. I never said you absolutely did or did not, but that an attorney in your country/province/state will know what information you do need and what your rights are. Which is also why I included a sample, from California (linked ) to see what rights someone in CA would have. Ultimately, someone cannot take away your right to a prenup by withholding trust information, your lawyer will know the laws of your specific jurisdiction and will know exactly what to do. Good luck!
