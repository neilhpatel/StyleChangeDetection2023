God's Chinese Son is principally a biography of Hong but placed in the wider context of the Heavenly Kingdom, so while it covers a lot of the formative period that Platt deliberately skips (thanks to God's Chinese Son already being well-known by that point), it also doesn't really go into the 'wider' war, per se. The best general summaries of the Taiping alongside other contemporaneous revolts can be found in William T. Rowe's China's Last Empire and Bruce Elleman's Modern Chinese Warfare, 1795-1989; otherwise there has been relatively little attempt to produce holistic overviews of the period of empire-wide rebellion in the 1850s through 70s (and Rowe's overview is relatively compartmentalised).
