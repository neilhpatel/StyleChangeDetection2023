Crazy because in the USA I feel people have gotten back into going to work, public and social gatherings while clearly sick. Like how it was pre pandemic.
who would have thought a country who tracks people with social credit scores, has camera's at literally every single intersection in the entire country, a single political party that you cant vote out, a non free press, massive social and economic challenges coming up this decade would want to keep all of its citizens under such a tight leash?
That sounds great! For China it's really good atm that Russia sucks so bad. Everyone is talking and watching what's gonna happen next in Ukraine and what's the next thing Russia is trying to make us believe like bees, mutant soilders, dirty bomb, moscitos and no one really cares about China and their endless and unhuman quarantine.
Yes. This is what Europe figured out. The on again, off again shutdowns were both relatively ineffective in their own right (by rhe time you got enough cases to warrant a shut down it was pretty wide spread) and also merely postponed the inevitable.
