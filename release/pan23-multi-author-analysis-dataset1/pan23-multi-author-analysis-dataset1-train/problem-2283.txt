Looking at the statute you provided, it may be a good idea to see if the town you live in has any ordinances that address the security deposit. There could be penalties or interest that you may be awarded in small claims court in addition to receiving your deposit back. The LL will have an impossible time proving the charges they are claiming if you have the documentation you've mentioned showing the property in good condition when you moved out. Unfortunately, these tactics are pretty common with shady landlords. I've had to write a few demand letters myself and fortunately, those were effective and I didn't have to go to court. Good work documenting your move out. I hope your are successful in getting your money back. Don't just let them keep it. Fight them.
Do EVERYTHING MOVING FORWARD in writing- email is ok but a written letter sent CERTIFIED RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED- and demand copies of the cleaning bill the company hired to clean the “gum and smoke stains,” including the names of the employees who “removed” said marijuana residue. Ask for any and all photographic evidence. Tell your LL you do not smoke ANYTHING- put this all in your letter and include a re line- “Re: Demand for Full Return of Security Deposit”.
