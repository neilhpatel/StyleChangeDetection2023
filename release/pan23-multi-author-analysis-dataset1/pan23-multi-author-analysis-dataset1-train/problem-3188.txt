Meaning theoretically the most people watching the president when he working is the secret service, his cabinet, and folks related to the work, the most people watching the speaker could be all of congress, the press, the entire country, and random people outside of the country who decide to tune in, and I mean who wouldn't for speaker Trump.
This just shows you that he's not fit for anything . Getting one vote hasn't made him realize what a normal person would . That he's finished and only has influence on the ignorant and those who have closed their eyes to the facts that were presented before them. Presented by Republican after Republican who had used the platform of the January 6th committee to tell his despicable story.
Wait. Doesn't this technically show he's not actually president since the president can't also be speaker? Didn't he just remove the illusion for his supporters by even entertaining this?
