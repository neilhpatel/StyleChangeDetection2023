Some health insurance plans cover tummy tucks in very specific instances. That's like going to a plastic surgeon to get a TT and being shocked that it wasn't covered afterwards because you read on the website that sometimes they cover it. It would not be malpractice for performing the procedure either. Regardless, you owe it.
I have no idea why you are trusting the professional opinion of an insurance company who didn't examine you clinically and who benefits financially from not covering your treatment.
Yes, you are correct. I did my due diligence, the procedure is covered by my insurance. The problem is that it was deemed by 2 other dental experts as unnecessary. Let me put this into maybe an easier perspective. You go to the doctor because your arm hurts, he tells you that your arm is broken and casts your arm. After 6 months you receive a bill from said doctor for the cost of the cast because the insurance company denied the claim. Denied due to unnecessary because your arm was in fact NOT BROKEN. This is my dilemma. I was told by my dentist, who did the X-rays, that this was a necessary procedure. I don’t have any way to verify this because I am not a doctor. I made sure the procedure was covered and trusted the dentist that it was necessary. It’s like having a claim for a cavity filling denied because there was no cavity.
