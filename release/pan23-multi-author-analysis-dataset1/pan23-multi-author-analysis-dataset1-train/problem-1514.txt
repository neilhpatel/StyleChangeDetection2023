The lein waivers are of paramount importance. In the grand scheme of homebuilding, OP would be taking quite a hit but a 15K overrun is not a huge money-for-nothing catastrophe. A contractor slapping a builder's lein against title for a $40K foundation, framing, windows or trusses because of an unscrupulous builder/GC really hurts because the homeowner rightly feels they are being asked to pay twice.
3. Covid not only was supplies higher so was labor. I’m not sure anyone could have planned for that. The average home is 20k more right now. Than pre covid. Did builder have contingency fund? Ours didn’t.
The only ‘changes’ for material we made were flooring, although we weren’t given a specific breakout of allowance for material, just a price for material and labor, and our siding color was more expensive compared to other colors.
1. Contact an attorney specializing in contract and lien laws. Depends on state you can be responsible for all builder attorney fees if judge decides you owe him 1 penny of the lien he files. Even if you don’t agree with it. Prevent a lien at all costs if you can.
