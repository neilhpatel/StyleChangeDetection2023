It's an escort carrier. They were cheaper and could be built quickly since were most often built upon a commercial ship hull. The US built a lot of them during WW2 as a stop-gap measure when fleet carriers were scarce. They are inferior to the true aircraft carrier. The escort carriers are generally slower and have lighter arms and armor. They also carry fewer planes.
TLDR summary. Iceland Foods had a trademark on the word Iceland and used it against actually Icelandic companies. This has been overturned and they've lost their trademark on the name of a country which was insane to begin with.
Really?. Oh I quite fancy getting arbitrarily detained for doing nothing worse than being a dual passport holder, charged under false pretences then languish in jail for several years whilst they ransom me to my other government.
Pride. They're also probably not going to use it like the US does, at least not with traditional aircraft. I think they're going the way of China and see carriers as massive drone motherships instead of landing areas for piloted aircraft. If you're using drones you might not even need a runway, saving lots of space that you can use for even more drones. Iran has shown they're developing drone technology. For what it's worth, I think that's their plan.
That's my point with this. Not the minutia of the history. We're getting awfully close to "The Chinese could never defeat the US Navy because they don't have carriers like ours" and then the Chinese are going to come out with a carrier that uses drones and surprise the West because China couldn't possibly do that. They don't need to be better. They just need to be good enough. The effectiveness of that strategy should be self evident in Ukraine where drones that you could buy at Walmart were being used to great effect. They don't need a billions dollar 5% of your GDP carrier to make it work.
