Pretty much exactly. They've got rose tinted goggles on for themselves, they are incapable of self regulation/moderation because they cannot see fault with what they do, after all, why would they when it is what they want? The game to them is figuring out how to get what they want, not how to figure out how to be a decent person and live a good life and make this world a little less hellish. If they wanted good stuff, it wouldn't even be that big of a deal, but what they want is no good for anyone except maybe the richest guys who are trying to sell it to them in exchange for being put into power since those individuals then get to walk away with the money and the power.
Absolutely. And Toyota's focus on the Hybrid market may not have Tesla's flash, but they're incredibly eco-friendly and totally proven tech. BMW seems to be focused on developing sport EV's that are fast af. Things are looking great beyond Musk!
Seriously. Like, seriously, what the fuck has Elon Musk ever actually done? Which of his goals have actually came through?
