Putin had made a mistake back in the day when he tried to talk to the widows of officers from the drowned submarine Kursk, a meeting after witch he was known to say that those poor widows were a $10 whores hired by the opposition.
2. He would pre-select who was at the table so the mothers he met would either be given lots of Ladas or Rubles so there was no chance they could fake they were ok with their son's death or situation then turn on Putin, start yelling and get revenge.
Yeah. I heard masha gessin talking about this. Putin basically thinks everything that happens in the world is at the behest of the us. So. Protests in Iran, is that because people are upset with living conditions and a theocratic and despotic regime who treats them like trash? Nope. It's because the us manufactured the protest. It's just how he sees the world. And because of this, everything made for public consumption is meticulously crafted by propaganda agents. No chance he actually meets any real mothers. As you say, they'll likely be kgb agents.
Another interlocutor of the President of the Russian Federation is Yulia Belekhova, the head of the Moscow Region Executive Committee of the pro-government All-Russian People's Front (ZNF). She also heads the Association of Council Chairs of Apartment Buildings of the Moscow Region. In 2016, she was included in the list of EU candidates for the State Duma (declared a 118-meter apartment), but did not pass.
