Germany had a thriving communist movement which staged several failed revolts throughout the 1920s, and despite these failures and quite severe repression, still maintained millions of supporters. The rise of Nazism went hand in hand with the smashing of left wing political parties, trade unions etc. and therefore that support was unable to take expression, even if there were isolated cases - the resistance movement in Germany generally etc. This is important because it shows that despite the vicious anti-communism of the Nazi party and the repression of the communist movement, the support for communism in Germany as a whole was not dead during their rule.
Essentially, much like the rest of the Nazi ideology, the ideological anti-communism of the Nazi party was not necessarily entrenched in German consciousness insomuch as people just accepted it as part of their overall capitulation of fascism. And once the Nazis were defeated, those who accepted it adapted to the new status quo.
Another question? How popular was communism before the soviets took control? Was it a minority party of a majority party? Did this make any diference in how people viewed the soviets?
