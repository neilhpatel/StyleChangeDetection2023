There's a scene in one of Patrick O'Brian's excellent seafaring novels wherein one of the main characters cheerfully mangles the official title of "comptroller" with something like "the poultry compter," and so my question is are the two related, or is it a simple accident of etymology?
OK, so the debt. As you're likely aware, a 'mark' has never been a denomination of British currency. It was an abstract amount worth worth about two thirds of a pound (13s 4d in old money), and for some reason it was used widely in the accounting profession. I'm not quite sure why. 100 marks would have been between £66-£70, which was a fair old wad of cash back in those days. Prior to the formation of a national banking system (that came much later in the c. 17th) or any kind of recognisable civil law enforcement authority to enforce payment, commercial and private debt was a hard fact of life. Transactions were based upon trust, not collateral, and business debt usually centred around non-payment for goods and services.
