I don't understand what this means: "...getting a copy of the easement...and then read it." I had the property surveyed at my expense four years after I bought it (when a different neighbor moved out literally in the middle of the night, saying goodbye to no one after a lifetime here. When I was looking at my house, he joked the fence isn't where it belongs, and I wondered if that played into the weird behavior). I know there's an easement. I know the fence (which was here when I bought the house) is on the property line. What exactly am I looking for to "read"?
Generally utility easements allow access to underground utilities. In most places you are either not allowed to build structures in the easement or if you do you are assumed to acknowledge that those structures may be damaged or removed in order to access the utilities. Sometimes, there is language that spells out that certain structures like fences are allowed and must be restored if removed to access utilities. But all of this depends on exactly what is said in the easement description in the deed and title paperwork. There is no blanket definition of what is and is not allowed in an easement, every easement is different.
