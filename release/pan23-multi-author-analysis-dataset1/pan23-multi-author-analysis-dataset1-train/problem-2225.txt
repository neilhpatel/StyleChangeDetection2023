My point was this study is bogus in trying to say one of them is worse than the other without considering quantities, methods, having a control group, and so on, which was my main point here, this study is almost worse than worthless, especially since it is only looking at people in their hospital system.
I get your point. But there's no safe amount of things you can light on fire and inhale. Whether that's weed, tobacco, firewood, trash, etc etc etc. It's not safe to light things in fire and inhale the smoke.
I will say it point blank, lighting things on fire and inhaling the smoke and carbonized ash of ANYTHING is bad for you. Some things might be worse to burn and smoke than others but there's the healthy amount of things you should smoke is 0.
