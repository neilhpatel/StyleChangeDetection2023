(There is also an element of the Zionist/Hebrew language movements wanting to be very distinctly Jewish and leaning into Hebrew and its alphabet in that respect, but honestly I think it's a distant second in terms of reasoning. There would never have been any reason for anyone to want to write Modern Hebrew in Latin characters.).
For instance, early 20th century scholar Louis Ginzberg was born in Kovno (modern Kaunas in Lithuania) and lived in Eastern Europe until he was around 20 (EDIT - correction - until he was a teenager), and in his writings he notes that he is not proficient in any Slavic language--not Lithuanian (the language of the countryside), nor Russian (the language of government since Kovno was in Russia then, and the language of a significant proportion of the population of Kovno), nor Polish (the language of a significant proportion of Kovno at the time). Kovno was about 1/3 Jewish, so he could travel easily in the Yiddish-speaking world, and while he may've known rudimentary Polish or Russian or Lithuanian (or some combination) to be able to ask for directions or read a train timetable or buy something in a non-Jewish store, he didn't need to be proficient in them. He needed to know Yiddish, Hebrew, and Aramaic for his religious study, French and German for his academic studies, and several ancient languages for reading ancient primary sources, but not Polish or Russian or Lithuanian. That wasn't true of every person in that position--many Rabbis of that era did know local vernaculars or government languages, and certainly people whose jobs required more interaction outside the Jewish world, but it does speak to the level to which people really could live their lives without much use for any writing system but the Hebrew alphabet.
