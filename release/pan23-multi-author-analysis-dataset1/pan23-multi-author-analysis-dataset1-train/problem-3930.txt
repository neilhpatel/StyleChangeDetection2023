I don't know the situation but from the same article, locals living near the park are getting caught in the effort. I would imagine not everyone is aware of the defined borders of the park and people may be getting shot for simply being in the wrong area.
Especially because. In many places where poaching are common. Poachers are also part of guerrillas and terrorist organizations. As they use poaching as a way to fund themselves.
Another factor that contributes to this positive result is the development work and overall security enhancement in the fringe areas of Kaziranga, especially in the Karbi Anglong district in the southern periphery of the National Park. Poachers would always travel through the rough and very lightly guarded hilly terrain of this district, pay the poor local villagers a handsome amount in return for a safe passage for themselves and the horn, and do the dirty deed without much of a hindrance. But now that these rough and underdeveloped areas are being developed and policing and guarding there is becoming better, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the poachers to reach Kaziranga. Kudos to all the forest guards and police personnel working tirelessly in those difficult regions.
