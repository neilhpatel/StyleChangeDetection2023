Wrong. The existence of the disease in the community is the reason you would catch it. There's no "policy" way around that except for complete lockdown.
The university would undoubtedly say that any reasonable person would understand that there is still a risk because of a pandemic that is ongoing, or even that since you were vaccinated and guidance at the time suggested that vaccination was protection against COVID (which was probably because at one point that was the understanding), you catching and being hospitalized from Covid was not foreseeable and therefore was not their fault.
Your school also could very well say to the court that “yeah, there’s a global pandemic on, and you assumed the risk by being aware of there being a global pandemic and registering for classes” and it’s very possible that the court agrees that any reasonable person would understand that risk.
If your school mandates regular testing for the unvaccinated (which the waiver looks like that’s what it does) and those procedures are followed, then it’s entirely possible that a court would recognize that as a sufficient precaution (especially in light of the recent rise of breakout cases). A lot of places are allowing this, and you would have to prove that was unreasonable, in light of the fact that plenty of other places around the country are doing this. I don’t think you would be able to do that.
