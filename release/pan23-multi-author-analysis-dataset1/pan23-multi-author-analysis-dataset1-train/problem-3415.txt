The view that pre-Enlightenment Scotland was a kingdom defined by its poverty, feuding, and religious fanaticism is one perpetuated by popular history and mainstream media. While the current historiography on early modern Scotland challenges many of these stereotypes, the field of Scottish history is traditional and deeply conservative. What this means is that, while historians of other regions have expanded their inquiries into subjects other than political history, Reformation Studies, and witch hunts, historians of medieval and early-modern Scotland remain generally fixated in these three major areas of study, with very little deviation.
I really enjoyed your answer, thank you! This might go without saying, but your assertion that the transition of Scotland from Catholicism to Presbyterianism was smoothed by Scotland’s intellectual culture raises a few other questions for me. First, does this imply that Scottish nobles of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance eras were not only highly literate, but more so than their English or continental counterparts? I ask this given the comparative ease with which the transition was made in Scotland as compared to, say, France or England, where there was a considerable degree of conflict during the reformation. My second question is do you think that the structure of the Presbyterian church further spurred on Scottish literacy and intellectualism? My (admittedly basic) understanding of Protestantism in the early Reformation era was that it encouraged believers to more directly engage with scripture, which seems like it would foster skills “close reading” of texts that would help later Scots to play a strong role in the Enlightenment.
