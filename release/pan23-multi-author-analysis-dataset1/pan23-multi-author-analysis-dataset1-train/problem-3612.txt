In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Eh. Instant runoff, which is what everyone means by ranked choice, is a start. Better than what most of the country does now. But don't set it up like some kind of ideal. It's another broken system that's a little less broken than what we're doing already.
Also, alphabetical order has nothing to do with the Consistency/Participation Criterion. What does that argument even mean?
Itâ€™s actually pretty easily manipulated by corporations who can back single issue candidates in target populations, basically building nefarious coalitions.
2. A situation where there is a majority who prefers one outcome to any of the other possibilities, but the voting system simply fails to identify that as the winner.
You could satisfy the "later no harm" criterion, for example, just by drawing a name from a hat and ignoring voters entirely, if you didn't care about choosing the right winner, but that doesn't make that a good voting system. You could satisfy the "consistency criterion" by always electing whichever candidate comes alphabetically first, and that also doesn't make for a good voting system. These would be terrible choices because it's more important to choose the right winner than anything else you could possible be worried about.
