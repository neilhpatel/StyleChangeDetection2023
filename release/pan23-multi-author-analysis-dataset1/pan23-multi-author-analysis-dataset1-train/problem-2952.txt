As others have said, the paucity of sources of “average” voices from history make this an almost impossible question to answer. And though it may not be applicable across the board, I do think Richard Landes’ article about millennialism might be instructive here. Against contemporary scholarly consensus, his article The Fear of an Apocalyptic Year 1000: Augustinian Historiography, Medieval and Modern serves as a return to the idea that the years leading up to the end of the first millennium were marked with fear and unrest.
Yeah, I think so. As u/Mister_Donut mentioned, most medieval people were probably worried about the seasons rather than what number legal scholars called the year. An example of this is during military campaigns, when soldiers were worried about getting back home in time for planting or harvesting season - and this is true for England just as much as in the Middle East, where people were using different calendars and even experienced the seasons differently. Even higher-ranking knights were concerned about getting home for the agricultural seasons, so it wasn't just peasants who were worried about farming.
