Additional information on guarding supply lines and roads could possibly be found in the 761st Tank Battalion's after action reports for December 1944 and January 1945, although it seems like a relatively minor portion of their service, and as Dade said, was a job probably better-suited for a quartermaster truck company than a combat tank battalion, which was desperately needed at the front lines. Mention of this duty is not found in Joe Wilson, Jr's The 761st "Black Panther" Tank Battalion in World War II: An Illustrated History of the First African American Armored Unit to See Combat (1999), Charles W. Sasser's Patton's Panthers: The African-American 761st Tank Battalion In World War II (2004), or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's Brothers in Arms: The Epic Story of the 761st Tank Battalion, WWII's Forgotten Heroes (2005).
Thank you for posting this. I knew Floyd Dade when he worked at the elementary school I attended. A wonderful, warm, generous man. It's hard to reconcile the patient and kind person he was with the horrors he must have seen in WWII. I'm so glad that they got his memories recorded, and I'm so tickled to come across them.
