Greetings! How fortunate that this question is one that I've been studying and reading about as befitting for my area of research (and flair). It is somewhat interesting, especially when one considers it (as no doubt OP has in the preamble of their question), why the Germans and Russians did not form an alliance in the waning years of the 1800s or even the early years of the 1900s. The answer however, is actually tad more complicated and requires us to get acquainted with some historical context (of course it does). Let's begin.
Is there any primary source evidence suggesting that the German government or influential intellectuals began viewing Eastern Europe as a possible place for expansion? Obviously we know what happened in world war one (satellites, free Ukraine) and world war two (bloody conquest which turned those sympathetic to opposition to Communism against the Germans) but I'm referring to any primary source evidence from before WW1. Thank you if you find the time for a reply!
This was all brought to the forefront of European politicians with the following line delivered by Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs Bernhard von Bulow in December of 1897 to the German Reichstag (essentially their parliament).
