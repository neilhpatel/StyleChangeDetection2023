In 189, the Han had been in a long decline, it had recently lost Liang and Bing provinces to Liang revolt and had to buy off Zhang Yan in Changshan. It was still united and at peace when Emperor Ling died and the latest round of eunuch vs gentry leaders (led by likes of Yuan Shao) began with the He clan split, Dowager He and He Miao seeing the eunuchs as a vital arm of the Han vs General-in-Chief He Jin who was persuaded by Yuan Shao that destroying eunuchs would ensure a great time.

These are just a couple more examples from... countless. It's not for nothing, after all, that nigh-impenetrable stamped clay walls were standard features for millennia for any Chinese city worth its salt. It wasn't because the warring factions of Chinese were particularly nice to cities. So, I dunno what "history" of China your friend learned... but it's missing some pretty key details.
