I am willing to bet that saving face and Zero Cases political stunts are going to rule the day yet again. When best practice responses get abandoned not 48 hours after a joint epidemiologist session – it's pretty clear that it's gonna be each economy for itself. Again.
You are assuming (probably because you didn’t read the article) that we are talking exclusively about virus variants that are linear derivatives of the existing variants, whereas the article talks in part about recombination events with currently entirely different Corona viruses occurring in nature and leading to the ‘worst case scenario’ as they call it.
I don't see it as a scare piece. It's just information. It's not cool to take your eyes off the road bc your simply tired of piloting. That's how bad things happen. Vigilance is important so everyone can shift as needed. I can't find good info anymore to do a thoughtful risk assessment. That's it.
Also evolution doesn’t favor anything. Selection favors something. But recombination events or even point mutations are always random and can lead to anything.
