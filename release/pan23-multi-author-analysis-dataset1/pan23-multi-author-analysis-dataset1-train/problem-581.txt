First thing to do is to request a per se hearing with Drivers' Safety as explained on the pink sheet of paper (temporary drivers license) that the police gave you. You have only ten days to make this request or your license will be suspended 30 days after the incident.. You can hire a lawyer to do this for you. Secondly, go to court on your arraignment date or hire a lawyer to go for you. If you do not hire a lawyer for your first court date you can ask the court to appoint the Public Defender who will then screen you for elgibility. You have a very good defense to CVC 23152(a) and (b) (DUI), but you might have problems with a PC 647f (drunk in public).
The officers admonishment wasn’t exactly accurate. You can refuse a post arrest test, but your license will be automatically applied for suspension to the DMV through an Admin Per Se form. We don’t admonish in that fashion, we simply provide them the opportunity to provide a blood or a breath sample. If they refuse all we apply for the admin per se form.
