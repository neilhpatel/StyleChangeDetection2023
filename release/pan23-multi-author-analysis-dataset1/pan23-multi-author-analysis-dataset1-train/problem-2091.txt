In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Nope. This Republican investment in false equivalency doesn't deliver the plausible deniability they wanted. The media scoff and laugh - but treasonous Republicans will always just come back with more bad faith hearings. Always. They are not guided by a moral compass - they wage war on democracy. Fascists don't need likes or public approval - they rule by lies and violence. Defy them - unite, organize and mobilize - rise up and defend democracy.
Exactly. It's almost as if these articles are designed to placate the people on the left into complacency seeing this, so that they feel like the hearings "backfired" when, in reality, it didn't backfire for the GOP. They never expected for it to be factual or substantive. It was always going to be smoke and mirrors and carefully curated moments to play up on right-wing media for their base.
