It isn't. If the bills were combined Republicans would have voted the whole thing down. What would have happened then?

Everybody knows Republicans are anti-labor. But the move Democrats did by splitting the bills isn't pro-worker, it's also anti-labor and it's very nature. Not only do railwood workers not have their bargaining power, they also don't get the one thing they had been negotiating for for a long time. Sure, this bill would have given them 7 days. But they should have put that in the one single bill to make sure it gets through, because Republicans also don't want the economy to halt. So if the two bills were together in one, in order to prevent the economy from stopping, they would have had to vote in favor of it. If they allowed the economy to stop, it would be plain to see for anyone that the Republicans stopped the economy purely because they didn't want to give railroad workers a couple of days of sick leave per year.
3 dems were not in the room. The votes were not there because if they were in the room the republicans on your list would just drop names to the other column to assure defeat.
