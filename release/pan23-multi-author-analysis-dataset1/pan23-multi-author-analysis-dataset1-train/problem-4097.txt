Do you have a source on those numbers? I'm not intimately familiar with the topic but 10 million Soviet built AK-47s sounds quite low, the Soviet Union did after all have something like 40 million personnel between it's active military and it's reserves at the point of its collapse (sure not every one of them was a rifleman, but not every single Soviet built AK-47 would have been in their armouries either with military aid to allies and weapons wearing out with use).
I never said they were all riflemen, I specifically said that they were not ("sure not every one of them was a rifleman") and my calculations were not based on the assumption but it was based on the assumption that everyone in a motor rifle regiment or a recon battalion would have access to at least one rifle, I did not count the headquarters, medical units, artillery, air defence, motorpool, engineering personnel, signals personnel, logistics personnel or a whole host of other components in a Soviet motor rifle or armoured division.
Yeah and they did have enough to equip a lot of them. Your 1.4 million riflemen would be 11.2 million if they mobilized all their conscripts. They had 15 million rifles give or take.
If it was 1991 they'd have 15 million rifles including 5 million AK-74. I don't think their reserves were kept to a professional level of readiness. I think they were probably just conscripts who had been pre-assigned a position in case they were called up.
