Now within various traditions of Christianity, there exists a whole set of frameworks and lines of theological reasoning to explain why Christianity is _still_ monotheistic despite the Trinity, veneration of saints, etc. Of course, those frameworks exists because it's _not_ obvious how Christianity, having these features, remains monotheistic.
So, to start, it's really arguable whether Zoroastrianism can be described as monotheistic (it's a little bit perspective-dependent), but I think the more salient point is that it didn't historically _construe_ itself as monotheistic.
Now, Ahura Mazda, the Supreme Creator, is certainly made very distinct from all these other deities and conceived of as the creator of all of them, but there is simply no concern in Zoroastrian tradition for this, prior to the subjection of Zoroastrians to Islamic rulers (where asserting at least a weak form of monotheism became important for the legitimacy and survival of the religion). Sasanian rulers had no problem identifying Ahura Mazda with Zeus, as Greeks had done before them, and especially in the east of the Iranian empires, all kinds of Zoroastrian-Buddhist-Hindu-Hellenic-Mesopotamian syncretisms had flourished across the ages.
While this is indeed true to an extent. The socio-politics did play a part in interpretations at the elite levels, I would still state that the methods of worship done by the commoners have more or less remained the same that is more less a polytheistic method of practise(worship/homage onto yazats & amesha spentas), an all encompassing monolatrous understanding of Ohramazd etc etc etc.
Thanks for these links. I think it’s clear that Zoroastrian ideas were either consciously or unconsciously integrated into both Christianity and Judaism.
However I can’t understand why both early Christians and Jews of that time were silent on Zoroastrian religion.
