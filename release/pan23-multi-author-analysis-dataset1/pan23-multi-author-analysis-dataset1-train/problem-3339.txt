Invest in a camera. Report the trespassing to the police and notify the neighbor and company to stay off your property verbally and by certified mail. You should check the roof for damages. If there are, then sue the neighbor and the company.
Other issue is liability. Say one of them 'falls' off the roof. Now they don't have insurance (of course) but you've got insurance? Why not make you their WC insurance guy....
I'd still call a deputy if I were you, but especially because it's at this point a past event, you can't identify the individuals (though the dashcan will absolutely help if you can see the tag number), and you can't prove that there was any vandalism/damage they will probably just tell you to put up cameras and to call if the issue is repeated.
Seems fishy to me. Like they were doing something else under the guise of this tree thing. Just my two cents.
EDIT: If these are random people not from a power company that were trying to work on electrical wires on YOUR roof without your permission, actually you definitely SHOULD call deputies and attempt to get them trespassed just so you have a paper trail in case you get sued by these dumbasses if they come back and get hurt on your property and they end up suing you for it.
Other note, this doesn't make sense. Something else is going on because I work in the solar industry and know how service connects to a house. The mast at the house is not where you disconnect the power.
