Yes, I do, but my parents have been speaking to them and they’re saying they’ll AT LEAST triple our plan because of the claims and they may not be able to afford to pay for me to drive anymore… I’m honestly just wondering if there’s even any way to defend myself at this point because of the fact that I admitted fault.
None of that matters. It is what it is. There's nothing worrying about it can do. Your insurance doesn't want to pay out money it doesn't need to, any more than you do. And again, you admitting fault makes zero difference in a rear-ending accident. You're always going to be 100% at fault regardless. (If you had admitted, falsely, to running a red light and t-boning someone, that might be different.) But what's done is done. The insurance will handle it. There's literally nothing for you to do now but to let them do their jobs. Good luck!
I guess the reason we’re assuming they’re lying is because my parents said that it’s common for people to make or exaggerate claims when they know the other person can’t defend themselves against the claims and it’s also a large company with a legal team so they can get away with claiming whatever they want I guess. After I told my parents how they made me admit fault on paper and stuff they said it sounds like they’re just trying to exploit the fact that im a teenage driver who didn’t know my rights.
