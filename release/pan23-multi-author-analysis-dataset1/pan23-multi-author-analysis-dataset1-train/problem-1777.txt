(And yes, I know the debate about calling it the Byzantine Empire, but for simplicity I'll gonna roll with it.).
Since you've already picked Bohemia as an example, it is worth pointing out that in general the kingdoms east of the Holy Roman Empire gained their recognition in a manner largely distinct from the western European ones. Using modern terms we could say that in the west it was a bottom-up process, where kingdoms (as institutions and titles) naturally formed from the tribal structures, as you've already explained (with added legitimacy from late Roman administration), but in the east it was a top-down situation where the titles were bestowed by either the Emperor (Poland, Bohemia) or the Pope (Hungary). All these three major cases were results of politics and diplomacy rather than contemporary beliefs, since granting the title also provided political influence over the realm for the "benefactor".
6. Or, you can forget about all the naming systems. Sometimes some rulers just claimed to be something, and everyone else just went with it.
