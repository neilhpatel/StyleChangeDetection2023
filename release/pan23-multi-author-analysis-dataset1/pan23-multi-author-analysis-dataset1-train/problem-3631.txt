I mean if we are going that route I’ll do you one better. It’s be great if we could all realize that religion was nothing but a collection of fables and fairytales. Used to explain things that we now know better. We should all realize that the human race is nothing but a collection of people just trying to live from one day to the next. We should all work towards the common goal of feeding the hungry and housing the unhoused. We make all drugs legal and subsidize drug treatment programs. Free healthcare for everyone.
The problem with tradition (on which many organized religions are huge) is that it vilifies change… you can not turn a 1200 year old boat overnight because it now suits you to publicly disagree with the other slightly-different-but-inherently-still-equally-oppressive sect.
yeah! some are very bad fairytales... although not everybody gonna agree with that tho specially ppl in conservative rural areas won't be happy when somebody tries to undermine their own way and their ancestor's way of life this is why being peaceable and understanding about other people's personal life is important, to learn to talk about our problems and solutions in a peaceful way also this is important as some of those folks are more gullible and prone to long term brain wash but, they don't realize that they have more power in votes (because numbers) assuming the voting is free and not corrupt unlike here in iran.
One step at a time. It’s hard to make everyone be nice at the same time. So you get one side to be a little nicer. Then you get the other side to be a little nicer. This way by making several small changes over time. You shed less blood because it feels like their own idea.
