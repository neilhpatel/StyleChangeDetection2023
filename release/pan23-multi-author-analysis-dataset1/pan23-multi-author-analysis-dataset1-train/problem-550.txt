Thank you for the reply. That seems incredibly ridiculous. So if I chose to adopt a pet, I cannot without having an existing pet? Which implies I should go buy an animal? (which I would prefer not to) And I didn't mention in the post, but I have had and taken care of animals in my childhood. So it's not the case that I've had no experience at all.
Any good and reputable rescues make sure the cats leave the shelter in the best circumstances for them to thrive because we don't want anything bad to happen to our babies, and at the end of the day it is upsetting for you to lose out on the kitten but you aren't our priority; that kitten who we watched grow up, often times nursed, medicated and raised so we know what's best for them and if that means we can't adopt to someone then we can't.
Thanks for the reply. And the situation is, is that this isn't my first pet. And while adopting is great for both younger and older cats, I had my eye on a specific kitten I liked. This is the unfortunate part.
