I am not a lawyer but I am a doctor and this is all standard of care. It sounds like your mom has improved to the point that she no longer needs hospital level care (which is good news). As frustrating as it may be to have her go elsewhere she realistically can't stay in the hospital indefinitely. The big reasons for this are: (1) the longer she stays in the hospital the more likely she is to get serious infections (we've unfortunately seen a lot of cases of hospital acquired COVID, MRSA pneumonia, VRE, MDR pseudomonas, etc) (2) it is very expensive for a patient to stay in the hospital (it costs way more than $200/day) and (3) the hospital needs the bed to care for other patients who are critically ill. The other sad reality is that there aren't a lot of places that can care for a patient who is chronically on a ventilator (especially in the era of COVID when so many former COVID patients are ending up on long-term vents). When a patient is accepted to a facility, especially if they have been rejected by other facilities, they can be forced to accept it (again because that's the only option and staying in the hospital indefinitely is NOT safe and is NOT a long term option).
It's pretty crazy. I'm wondering if it would be worth using her savings to buy better insurance?? Or would it be too late to do all of that? Thank you!
