RSMO 575.190: 575.190.  Refusal to identify as a witness — penalty. — 1.  A person commits the offense of refusal to identify as a witness if, knowing he or she has witnessed any portion of an offense, or of any other incident resulting in physical injury or substantial property damage, he or she refuses to report or gives a false report of his or her name and present address to a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties.
I'm not angry. I'm frustrated- you didn't want actual answers, you want someone to blindly agree with you.
You can also look directly at the definition of infraction, misdemeanor, and felony as defined within the Missouri laws which clarify that an infraction is not an offense, and that an offense is defined specifically as a misdemeanor or felony, AND the definitions for misdemeanor/felony contain the same language while the definition for infraction does not.
Yes. The arbiter of that is SCOTUS. Can you cite a SCOTUS (or any appellate) decision which rules this law is unconstitutional?
This is wrong, and I've cited case law from SCOTUS that shows you are wrong and I have no interest in arguing with you further.
