Richard Frank in his book Downfall: The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire discusses those messages sent between Foreign Minister Togo and Ambassador Sato in mid-July. Ambassador Sato replied to Tokyo before he got to talk to Foreign Minister Molotov (who was stalling) that the Russians would want to know what terms the Japanese were willing to accept before they would consider intervening (not knowing the Soviets already intended to go to war with Japan). He told Tokyo that the situation would probably require the Japanese to accept unconditional surrender or something similar. He later clarified that the continuation of the Imperial Institution and the Emperor went without saying but that with that one exception it would probably be necessary to accept something like unconditional surrender. Minister Togo stated that unconditional surrender was "unacceptable under any circumstances whatsoever." (p. 230) In that same message he stated that "it would be both disadvantageous and impossible, from the standpoint of foreign and domestic considerations, to make an immediate declaration of specific terms.".
that even the "peace party" was insistence on the preservation status of the Emperor at an absolute minimum — to abandon the Imperial system would be abandoning what made Japan "Japan" in their eyes.
Thanks a lot for the response! I find it kind of ironic that the US didn’t even execute the emperor after the bombs were dropped. I find this stuff fascinating because it’s making be question a lot of the stuff I was taught.
