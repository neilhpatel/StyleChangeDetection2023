Serbia denies that Serbian citizens were involved in preparing military actions aimed at destabilising Moldova up to the overthrow of power, as stated by the President of Moldova based on data transmitted by the Ukrainian special services.
I have a hard time believing your statement is made in good faith. Right now in the continent there are two sides: the EU and EU-aligned countries, and Russia and Russia-aligned countries. Moldova and Ukraine are clearly in the EU camp.
Crazy how back then us and the American used to be allies and now American kids are trying to justify hatred for Serbs because an Austohungarian national killed the Austrohungarian heir to the throne in a forcefully annexed region, which Austohungary used as an excuse to murder 3/4 Million Serbs in an attempt to expand their empire.
It's not fair to claim it caused WWI. I think it's best classified as the lit match dropped into the gasoline. Geopolitical and economic factors led the word to the precipice of war in the decades leading up to it.
As with many wars, it was escalatory. At the end, the world asked "how did we get here?" The answer is gradually over time. The rival entities were enemies in all things even before the guns started firing. The treaties, the arming, the rhetoric, and the resources were well into place before the archduke committed what could have been a singular and granular event in world history, if not for the state of world affairs which were the context in which the assassination and the war to follow unfolded.
