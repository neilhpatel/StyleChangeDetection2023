Insurance companies are a private companies in case you didn't know that. Or do you think having to have insurance to host a speaking engagement is a violation of the 1st amendment now? How about taxes, is it a violation of your rights for the gov to tax your gun purchase? And does that go to all the other rights? Like the gov can't tax my commercial TV add spot I buy? Can't demand billboard companies have insurance? News orgs no insurance? No fire codes for the local news station?
Plus there's the "bonus" of being able to link trans individuals and drag performers together, making it two-for-one propaganda deal, and insinuating that trans individuals are choosing to dress up just like drag performers, thus eliminating their identity and making the laws appear "not so bad" to the public.
And you know? Maybe we should start demonizing gun owners in the same way. But we won't, because there are still a shit ton of liberals that own and know how to use guns without making it part of their core identity.
