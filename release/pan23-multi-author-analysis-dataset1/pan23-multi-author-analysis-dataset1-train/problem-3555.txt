Have you contacted your landlord/manager about the situation? If the manager refuses to rectify the situation, I would get my own private room and ask for reimbursement from the property owner.
Also: Document document DOCUMENT. take pictures of your belongings, write down everything that has occurred, to the best of your knowledge, with dates, times, names, etc. These may be helpful should you need to take further action.
I started documenting everything. I have the time and date they informed me that I wouldn’t have a roommate. I also documented all the information from what the hotel could tell me and the random girl. She was in my room for over 2 hours without me being there. .
I think these points may not be important immediately (the first, However would mean you'd have additional quick-solving options directly through the hotel), but you can more easily argue the issues of the absolute absurdity if the answer to 2 is "one", regardless.
I got my room back to being private. I’m still very distressed. Literally my worst nightmare of living in a hotel was coming back to someone else being in my room. I will call my state representative and senator tomorrow.
