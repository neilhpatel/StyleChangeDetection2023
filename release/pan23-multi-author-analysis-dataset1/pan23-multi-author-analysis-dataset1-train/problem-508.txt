Throughout the medieval period, Ireland fails to produce a single saint-king, which is in contrast to England which in addition to its martyr-kings develops cults to kings who died of natural causes like Edward the Confessor. Considering that the only English sainted martyrs are kings, this tells us something about how conversion happened in both Ireland and England: It was mostly peaceful. Bede would have you believe that the pagan Mercians were after the Christians for their faith, but Christian English kings fought each other all the time too. It's just the ones who died fighting pagans that got rebranded as martyrs. Our only Welsh martyr, Tewdrig ap Teithfallt, was similarly a king who died fighting against pagans, the invading English. The pagan English didn't kill him because he was a Christian, but because they were trying to conquer his lands, much like the Mercians who killed Oswald, Edwin, Ã†thelberht and Edmund. (It's worth noting also that Tewdrig's cult has a much later attestation, first asserted six centuries after he supposedly lived.).
After having reading your response, I agree with your assessment that it wasn't necessarily martyrs who died for Christianity, as much as it was Christian Kings who happen to fight land wars with non-Christians and a later revisionist history turning it into a religious meaning.
