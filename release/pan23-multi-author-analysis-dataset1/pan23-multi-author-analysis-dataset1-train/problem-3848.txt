I have very longs text with what he wants me to pay for, I spoke to him and his wife for a while. I’m not 100% this isn’t a scam, I’m just not sure what he would tell the police since I literally didn’t ask for any videos or pictures from her or say anything sexual. She sent me a picture then I asked if I could send one back and that was it. Thank you for your advice.
Generally-speaking, what you did falls under disseminating obscene material to a minor, among a few other possible relatively minor infractions (e.g. contributing to delinquency, etc.). Do note that the federal law defines "minor" in this case as anyone under 16, so you should be safe federally. States may have stricter laws which may apply, so you could still be in jeopardy. The only advice to really give you here is if you receive any kind of court paperwork, verify its authenticity first, then retain a criminal defense lawyer in the jurisdiction of the court. You don't owe anything to the father, and in fact those demands could qualify as extortion of blackmail.
