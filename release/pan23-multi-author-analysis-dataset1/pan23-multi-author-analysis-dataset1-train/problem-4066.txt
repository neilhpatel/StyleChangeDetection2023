In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
republican policy priorities. lol. as if they had an agenda beyond crying about fake infringements in free speech and being vaguely pro business.
Exactly. You have a D from West Fucking Virginia. You're playing with house money. Get another D in the Senate so you can allow him to "oppose" the "big ol liberals" and endear himself more to his constituents. Meanwhile, he'll keep passing your judges and voting for infrastructure bills while playing the political game.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahah. Watching republicans whine and cry after declaring a red wave is the best thing to happen to the world in years. Who would of thought that repealing human rights, supporting fascist autocratic lunatics, disparaging minorities and being morally bankrupt fuckwads would lead to the biggest blue wave in 3 decades.
