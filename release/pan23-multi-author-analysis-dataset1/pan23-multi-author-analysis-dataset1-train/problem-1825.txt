Just to correct a misconception, nothing in this situation requires you to file charges against your mother. You need to report the identity theft to the police and dispute the invalid charges or you need to pay the bill. It's up to the police whether they do anything other than file your report. They often don't. It's up to the DA whether or not to charge your mom for her financial crimes if the police choose to investigate and end up referring the case for possible prosecution. Your opinion likely doesn't matter to either of those organizations. You'd just be reporting that those charges weren't incurred by you. You don't have to solve the mystery for them.
The options are 1) file a police report against mom for fraud, take a copy of the report to the utility and have the charges erased, 2) pay $21k or 3) suffer severe credit damage for however long it takes the utility to garnish $21k from you + seven years afterwards until it drops from your credit reports.
Thank you for the help. I'm gonna get a lawyer to take a look over the contract and terms of the account as a final measure, and then if all else fails get her set up on a payment plan with them so they don't come after me.
