/u/Spiritof454 has mentioned the issue of lead, but it must be noted here that Vitruvius... didn't neecessarily know all that much about aqueducts outside the basic engineering, or at least the section on aqueducts is in some places rather confusedly garbled, so apart from the lead piping bit we don't get too much out of him. (EDIT: I am being deliberately harsh here – according to Frontinus, Vitruvius did have a hand in aqueducts management.) He's invaluable for understanding aqueduct construction and design to some extent, but our key source on aqueducts in context, and especially on the administrative practices surrounding them, is Sextus Julius Frontinus' On The Aqueducts (de Aqaeductu, henceforth d.A.), completed 100 AD under Trajan. Frontinus composed this while still aqueducts curator, to which position he was appointed by Nerva in AD 97, although he also had a rather distinguished military career and composed at least two other works related to this – one on military theory (which doesn't survive) and its companion piece, the Stratagems (which does). One thing Frontinus includes is a rather exhaustive set of details about each individual aqueduct, and often remarks upon the cleanness of the water. Just to bring up one example.
But I never hear about hygiene/sanitation systems for the water mangement systems of other Mesoamerican cities, despite the fact that a great deal of Mesoamerican sites, such as Palenque, Tikal, Teotihuacan, Caracol, etc, have interconnected agricultural canals, aquaducts, reservoirs, drainage systems, etc.
