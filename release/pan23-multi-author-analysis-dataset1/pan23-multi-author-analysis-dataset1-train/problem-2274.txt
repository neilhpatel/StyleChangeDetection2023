I'll also add this, my house was bought and sold 3 times in the last 9 years and each seller sold it for considerably more than they bought it for. My point is you may be able to sell your house and get rid of this problem and forget all about it someday. I hope I get to do the same.
so mine also has a huge crack on the foundation, a big chunk was broken off and the rebar is exposed, also theres like 7 in of gap between foundation and soil, since they didnt bother filling in the gaps after lifting the foundation =/.
County records? Like work permits? If that's the case then you have a smoking gun. Work permits for foundation repair coupled with a disclosure agreement that doesn't indicate foundation repair... You might have a case.
Was the previous owners foundation repair paperwork presented to you in any way prior to the sale? Is there anything in the disclosure agreements that mention repairs to foundation and/or drainage If so, then you were notified. If not, how do you know the previous owner did the repairs? How do you know it was 2-3 years ago if you weren't notified? If your 'proof' is anecdotal (neighbors claim they saw work being done) then your SOL.
