This is the reason for the famous Dawson City Film Find. Up in the Yukon, it was the dead end for those films, getting them months after they'd been released and seen by everyone else. Once they'd been seen, they were no longer considered valuable and the studios didn't want them back. So silent films began to literally pile up in Dawson City. Many hundreds of pounds of them caught fire accidentally ( nitrate film) or were set fire on purpose, or even just pitched into the river. But some 300 silent films were buried, and survived in the ice and permafrost to be re-discovered in the 1970's.
Quite the opposite, actually. From their very beginnings, movies were an entertainment for the masses, and were often looked down upon by the wealthy and the educated. Remember: movies had very little dialogue (short of a few intertitle cards), and relied heavily on pantomime and broad narratives, which meant that their stories were crass and simplistic in comparison with literature and the theater. As such, movies were often perceived as an entertainment for children, immigrants, the working class, and the illiterate and uneducated. The wealthy still went to the theater for their public entertainment; the common folk went to the movies.
