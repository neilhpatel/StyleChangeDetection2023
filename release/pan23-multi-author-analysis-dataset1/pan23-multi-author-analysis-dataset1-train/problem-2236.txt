So how do I go about getting a written exemption equivalent to the glorified hall pass that a vaccination card is?
Iâ€™ve never heard of a medical exemption from the vaccine. I mean my reason is that I already had covid and have the anti bodies, and I would rather be of the last few million to get mRNA than the first, because of the side effects, especially for people who have already had a covid infection.
Fraud is illegal. There doesn't have to be a government seal for someone to be committing fraud. Additionally, and separately, some of the people arrested have committed other crimes, violated other laws, like the people going to Hawaii. Whether or not their fake cards were illegal in themselves or not, they used to fake cards to break the quarantine law. But also your scheme is unlikely to work. The card suggests that the vaccine was noted by someone (obviously) and an employer or other entity can just go back to that someone. If you have reasons, talk to your doctor about whether or not they are good reasons medically, and if so, get a true exemption.
