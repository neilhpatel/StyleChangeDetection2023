They’re targeting Hunters Drug abuse for the wrong reasons, drug abuse is relatable to everyone. I just felt like Biden would’ve taken the opportunity because it’s so close to home to make changes for drug offenses. He helped create the 1986 Anti Drug Abuse Act that put tons of poor people away for smallest possession of crack. Hunter wears a go-pro while scaling up the crack he buys. It’s hypocrisy at its finest, some of those people are still locked up for an epidemic they started.

Gotta love how they demonize Fetterman for having serious medical conditions while praising illiterate, uneducated republican representatives like MTG & Bobo.
And? He can barely speak, process what he hears, or walk? Have you actually seen what even a minor stroke will do to a healthy individual, it’s human nature for him to act like he’s okay and it was only minor especially with all the eyes on him.
I just think you’re giving him more credit, and I believe he’s doing what any human would do in that position and make his stroke seem nothing more that a minor inconvenience.
