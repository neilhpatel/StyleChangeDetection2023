If these are present, then its usually safe to conclude its an academic book. Now as for its status within academia, that is a different issue entirely. Check the publication date. Generally speaking older books may not be entirely relevant/up to date as new information may have come to light in the intervening period. You can google online for reviews, though a big chunk of academic book reviews end up in journals and those are usually all stored in places like JStor which requires institutional affiliation to browse freely. But you might get lucky.
Has it been positively reviewed in academic journals, for example, Journal of American History or a more specialized outlet like Journal of American Ethnic History?
Sure, but there will always be limits. This is not an intentional policy to obscure knowledge on the part of historians. This subreddit is testament to the lenhs historians will go to in order to educate the public. They are constantly angling for better education initiatives in schools and the like.
