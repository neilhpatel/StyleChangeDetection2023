"More voters (154.6 million) turned out for the presidential election in 2020 than in 2016 (137.5 million), the largest increase between consecutive presidential elections since the inception of the CPS voting supplement in 1964.".
All these Republicans finally coming out and saying Trump should be disqualified while they held their tongues for two years don’t actually give a shit about Trump destroying democracy, theyre just being political opportunists who want trump out of the field to run themselves.
I’d counter that with 1. Trump was wrongly written off in 2016; 2. Hillary wasn’t a great candidate and helped Trump win because she isn’t great on the stump or an inspiring speaker and there’s a long and deep dislike of her across the political spectrum; and 3. Trump had trouble landing a punch on Biden who stayed off social media and presented himself as a bland but reliable moderate.
