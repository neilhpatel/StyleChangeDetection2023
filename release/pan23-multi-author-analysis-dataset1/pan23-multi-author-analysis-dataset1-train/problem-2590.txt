The residency issue isn't going to be solved in court. No court will order specific performance requiring the company to file for immigration benefits; and it's likely any promissory estoppel case would fail anyway, given the company is not in a position to actually secure an immigration benefit (since that's at the discretion of USCIS and the number of available visas); so your BIL did not have a sufficiently grounded reliance interest to demonstrate a PE or detrimental reliance claim.
That is an odd assumption. If this employer promised sponsorship, I would expect the engineer to come on a H-1B and an O-1 visa only. Reporting fraud for the O-1 would be the same.
Virtually no one is actually brought into the US on an H-1B anymore, as the chances of getting selected each year in the lottery are 30% with a long away start date - someone from Mexico (or Canada) who is in an eligible profession will always come in on a TN, as the start date can be near immediate and guaranteed. You can then enter the H-1B lottery at your leisure should you decide you want to apply for an employment based green card or be more flexible in your job titles/occupation (TN doesn't allow managers for example).
That said, moving from the TN to a green card is fraught with issues, mainly being that the TN requires only temporary intent, which is why most employers want you to move to the H-1B (which allows for dual intent) prior to filing for a green card.
