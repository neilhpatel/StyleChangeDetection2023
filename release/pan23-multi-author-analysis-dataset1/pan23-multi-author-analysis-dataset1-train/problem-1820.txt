Exactly. And the Pentagon statement actually says it has the "capability to maneuver" not that it's actually maneuvering. Which is close enough to what the Chinese said "limited ability to maneuver". Honestly it's like a game of telephone that gets more alarmist with each repetition.
Possibly. Dictatorships tend to greatly overestimate themselves and severly unerestimate democratic nations.
1. If the US is intercepting images from the thing, we could be learning a lot about Chinese capabilities. We may be figuring out how accurate their image sensing capabilities are; we may be learning about the resolution of their lenses; and we may be learning if and how they encrypt information. Those could all be valuable.
But the communication may have some other issues, security vulnerabilities that allow you gather some interesting (meta)data and/or manipulate it.
2. I also wonder if shooting it down is what the Chinese want? For example, maybe the idea is to get us to paint this thing with some kind of targeting radar and that act, in and of itself, might give the PLA something that they want to know about us.
