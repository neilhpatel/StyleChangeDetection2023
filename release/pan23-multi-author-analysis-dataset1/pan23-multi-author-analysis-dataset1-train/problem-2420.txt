One of NRO's most recent article exhorts the GOP not to abandon tht fight against marriage equality. It even explicitly frames it as an effort to protect children because every child deserves a mom and dad and gay marriage sabotages that reality. Like, it says that just like the anti-abortion movement it's about helping little kids and could be sold as such. It also offhandedly mentions it's a problem how easy it is to get divorced and identifies adultery and pornography as other social poisons that need to be addressed but says conservatives must start with a focus on marriage equality.
Scary thing. Pundits think what went wrong was the order of things. That republicans were hoping for the Harper case to come first so the republicans could disregard elections going forward and then abortion was supposed to be undermined to keep the evangelicals happy.
I loved reading this. It's also important to remember that Republicans turn out to vote in every election. What we saw this midterm was the same number of conservative voters as there ever was (all of them).
