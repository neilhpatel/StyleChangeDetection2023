Also id get my soil tested because, again assuming based on 5acres that, yall are on well water. And if he had a vendetta that could be years of roundup or picloram, Atrazine(preterm complications) potentially even dioxins. Not to be a fear monger but barrels of that still turn up.
I have used this when renting vehicles with Zipcar (emailing photos/videos) to document anything unusual before taking possession, when moving into/out of an apartment, at work to establish patterns of behavior, etc. Having multiple email strings like this also lends credibility to any that I might need to present as evidence in the future. I even do this with people who refuse to have documented conversations by sending an email to them to "sum up" our chat. When that isn't safe or an option (perhaps I don't have their email or cell number) I send myself an em to recap the conversation as soon as I can after the conversation... it's easy to forget details weeks/months/years after.
