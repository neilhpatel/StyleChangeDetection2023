>Reversing on appeal, the court held that the forceful dispossession of plaintiff's plate in an offensive manner was sufficient to constitute a battery. Plaintiff was entitled to actual damages for mental suffering due to the willful battery, even in the absence of any physical injury.Â Damages for mental suffering are recoverable without the necessity for showing actual physical injury in a case of willful battery because the basis of that action is the unpermitted and intentional invasion of the plaintiff's person and not the actual harm done to the plaintiff's body.
2. In the future, don't give crazy people your contact info. Just leave. If they call the police, they call the police. No good comes of someone like that knowing how to get ahold of you.
Infinitesimal. Their game is to scare people into paying them not actually go to the police. What you did isn't even a crime. So unless they lie and say you struck or pushed their kid, which would add another crime onto extortion, nothing will happen.
They are attempting to extort you which is a crime. Block all contact with this person. If they police want to talk to you, say nothing without an attorney. If you are sued, consult an attorney.
Did you check to see if this person really is an attorney? If they are, file a complaint with the Bar Association with the email as evidence. They are probably just pretending.
