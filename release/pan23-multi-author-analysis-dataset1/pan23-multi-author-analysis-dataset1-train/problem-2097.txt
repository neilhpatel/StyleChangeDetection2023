The French were also weary of the Communists in Moscow, though they had by 1939 grown accustomed to dealing with left-wing parties in their own assemblies (and Prime Minister Edourad Daladier had silenced that internal threat by August 1939). In fact, the French seemed to be more concerned with ensuring that if an alliance could not be agreed upon, then it was the Soviets who should receive the blame for the failure, rather than the Western democracies. However, the French also (and perhaps mistakenly) decided to "go with Britain" on many of the points when negotiating the Soviets. They entrusted the Foreign Office to do much of the correspondence between the Allies and Moscow, whilst giving their support if certain conditions which the French believed ideal (such as not having to commit to a military alliance just yet), and generally waiting for the British to act on their behalf.
These conditions would take more time than was ideal to negotiate and agree upon, which to Chamberlain and his cabinet was perfectly fine, as they (wrongly) believed that the longer the Soviets were kept busy negotiating with them, they would not dare begin negotiations with Germany, and Hitler would not begin his expansion drive again for fear of adding more weight to an Anglo-French-Soviet alliance.
Ok, a nitpick here. Churchill wasn't in government except as a backbencher until the day war was declared, 3 september, so didn't have any involvement in the talks. And as much as he loathed communism he feared Nazism more - If Hitler invaded hell I would make at least a favourable reference to the devil in the House of Commons.
