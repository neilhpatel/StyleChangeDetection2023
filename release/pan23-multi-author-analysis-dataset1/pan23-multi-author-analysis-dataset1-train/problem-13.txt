In both cases, the second category is the kind that existed in real life and was given at institutions like Delphi. The first kind is basically mythological. It's fictional. And it has a separate origin, not directly related to real institutional oracles. (At least until the Roman era: at that time, life seems to have begun to imitate art, but our evidence is pretty unclear at that time.).
Specifically, the examples Kiwi gives are illustrative of the manner which some groups of people attempted to obtain the most 'accurate' (that is to say, free of human influences) oracles possible from oracles givers. They are not a comprehensive analysis of the form in which oracles were given. On this point, many scholars (whose names are lost to my memory at the moment, sorry) have commented that the ancient Greeks demonstrated an 'astonishing mix of naivet√© and cynicism' in their attitude toward oracles taking. Meaning they went to great lenhs in devising ways to make the oracles impartial (veiled questions for example), yet they seldom doubted such things as pneuma, or the 'divine breath' Delphic oracles giver were supposedly inspired by for example.
