After all, vaccines do nothing, that's why its not the case that China has much worse outcomes with their own attempts at one. You are truly the victim, and definitely not of the religious cult which leads you to be isolated from society at large, but by your average joe telling you that rejecting epidemiology makes you seem foolish.
Also how does mpox move us a long? Whats the first thing people are gonna ask? What does the m stand for? Well....monkey...
I mean the fact we now have a (mostly) global social network which when combined with a critical mass of humans and the geographic area this virus was first identified in you don’t need to be the sharpest tool in the box to figure out my “thinkIng” or do you need me to draw you a fucking picture?
No, I'm fine. I didn't care what people were doing or saying during covid. The hypocrisy is so obvious, and that's what gets me. People who didn't want the vaccine were the ones "driving the pandemic" (ended up not being true) and lots of news stories and constant media attention about how being unvaccinated was so bad for you.
