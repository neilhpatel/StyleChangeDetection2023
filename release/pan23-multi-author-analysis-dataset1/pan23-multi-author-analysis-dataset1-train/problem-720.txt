Distilled beverages like vodka, whisk(e)y, tequila, and brandy are however diluted prior to bottling. These beverages start off the same way as beer and wine (fermenting sugar with yeast) but then are boiled to collect the vapor that is higher in alcohol content. This vapor is condensed and now you have higher % alcohol Whiskey comes off the still at around 80% alcohol, while vodka comes off the still at around 95-96% alcohol. These are then diluted before barreling and bottling to the 80 proof (40%) that you usually see in spirits. It is physically impossible to distill alcohol past 95.63% due to a complex physical phenomena called an “azeotrope”. So no culture has ever drank “pure” alcohol. Besides, having tried 80% alcohol before, I don’t know why anyone would want to drink that. It hurts.
While on a tangent but often mentioned on questions bout alcoholic drinks in the past, is an answer by /u/sunagainstgold about in medieval Western Europe due to water works and irrigation but was frowned upon socially because it was free.
