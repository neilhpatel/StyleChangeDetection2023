Bernie is the exception of an 80yo and the only 80yo I'd feel comfortable voting for. Joe can't remember shit and has said some pretty shitty stuff, telling stories that are clearly not factual. I'll vote for him if he's the nominee but it is voting for the lesser of two evils.
I'll vote for Biden's stupid ass if he ends up the nominee, but, no, I am not "with" him. Stop nominating dinosaurs! I am an old fucker, but political old fuckers are out of touch with working Americans. I cannot forgive Biden for his treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearing. Biden is a primary reason Thomas now sits on SCOTUS with his horrible wife who wants to overthrow a legitimate election whispering in his ear, or is she listening to her husband and then spreading his bullshit.
Yea. God, I wish Joe was in better shape. He basically just needs to outlive this Russian conflict because Putin will raise the stakes the moment someone new is elected.
