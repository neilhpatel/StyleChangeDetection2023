Thank you so so much, this reply is so helpful and has really changed my perspective on how to take notes with secondary literature I feel really, silly(?) I guess, that I'm in my final year and this has only clicked now, but better late than never I think one reason that I've been basically rewriting things because my topic is very niche and there's not much literature available (apparently it can be a good thing for a dissertation, I am starting to dislike past me for that decision though). But to be honest, it's clear now that I actually didn't really understand how I was supposed to be using the secondary literature or what the purpose of it was (all I knew is that I needed historians' opinions), so your reply has legitimately helped so much. Thank you again, you're a lifesaver.
