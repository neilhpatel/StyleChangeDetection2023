The distinction between civilisation and pre-civilisation is one of arbitrary nature and reflects a division between written history opposed to oral or material. That is the emergence of writing is how we decide when civilisation begins (with the peculiar exception of the Incas), as writing is understood to be preceded by emergence of a complex urban societies where need for recordkeeping necessited it's development. Whetever the appearence of writing itself was recognised is an interesting question I can't get into, but what I can tell you is the simple fact no civilisation appeared ex nihilio but was preceded by increasingly advanced cultures, which term is used by archeologists to express commonality observed among material findings, from which one may derive the existence of a distinct group.
The Earth was destroyed after Jackal crashes the royal granary, resulting in a flame deluge. The seeds are used to restore the world.
That said it's important to recognize that besides these latest phases these connections are not necessary one of linear lineage owing to the often thousands of years and many identified phases some of these cultures went through, so a simple "A existed before B in X place therefor A is ancestor B" statement can never be made until proven by additional research.
