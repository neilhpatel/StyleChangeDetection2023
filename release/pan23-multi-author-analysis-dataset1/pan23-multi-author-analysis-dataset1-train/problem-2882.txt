Honestly, she's annoying and rather condescending. She has good points, but her incessant nagging at such a young age:
Countries report their emissions through what is known as a ‘bottom up’ approach, where national emissions are estimated by combining data on types of activity with the emissions typically produced by those activities. So, if you know how much carbon dioxide steelmaking produces, and you know how much steel is produced in your country, you can estimate the total quantity of emissions from the steel sector.
I forgot. China is Fascist. That communism isn’t fascist. Just all the communists governments have turned into fascist states. But not because communism. Communism is good, just have not tried it for real yet. /s.
She a young girl trying to convince the world government to actually address climate change and the governments ignore her and continue business as usual and the overall population is happily and blindly marching toward its own destruction because we are seemingly more interested in the wealth of a few over the long term viability of this planet.
Who is China and India producing for? And if you look at per capita neither India nor China make the list.
