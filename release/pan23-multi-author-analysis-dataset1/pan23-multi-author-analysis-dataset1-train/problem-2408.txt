"It's often said that George Washinon and other founding fathers were opposed to political parties. What did they propose instead, and did they try to encourage said alternative?".
Short answer: In the early United States, we went from having no party system to a two-party system (1789), to a dominant-party system (1800), to a one-party system (1816), to a multi-party system (1824), to a two-party system in a more stable equilibrium (1828, 1860).
After reading your post, I read Washinon's farewell address. He was clearly stating his opposition to the party system. I was wondering: how much of Washinon's speech was his own thoughts, and how much was Hamilton's? How much power does the speech writer yield, or does the president give them the points to cover? Thanks for your insight!
After the democratization of the 1820's, you start to see modern political machinery, vote-getting, campaigning, sloganeering, patronage and spoils. The 2nd generation, Jackson and especially Van Buren, are easily identified with parties as a positive good. I love to talk about the 1st Party System in all of its mayhem, but the 2nd and 3rd really solidified the two-party monopoly.
