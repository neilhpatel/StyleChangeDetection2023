The arrival of English settlers in the South, and the emergence of the Native slave trade shattered the Southeast. While earlier scholars originally thought epidemic disease prompted societal collapse in the Southeast, we now know a combination of factors linked to the slave trade reshaped the region. Between 1685 and 1715 highly conservative estimates indicate the English, and their Native allies, enslaved 24,000-51,000 Indians and shipped them to plantations in the Caribbean. The slave trade set off a refugee crisis. Survivors tried to flee into the heart of the continent, displacing existing nations and sparking further conflict, and Spanish allied mission Indians fled south to the Keys where they begged for ship passage to Cuba to escape the slavers. Disease followed the slaving trails inland, prompting the first large verifiable smallpox epidemic in the late 1600s. A combination of slaving raids, warfare, disease, territorial displacement, and social upheaval shattered the Southeast.
Thank you very much for your answer. It's truly a completely new horizon on this topic, as I have begun to study it on my own as a side project (being mostly educated in European Middle Ages, thus the starting example of my inquiry).
