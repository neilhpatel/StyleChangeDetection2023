Oh it's worse than that. Apparently it's illegal to murder virgins in Islam, so they are "married" to prison guards and raped before being executed in the morning. Fuck religion.
For other lovely wonderful things an "unarmed"-but-expecting-that-capture-will-lead-to-death protester can carry or make to defend themself or attack the regime, consider >homemade bombs, caltrops, knives, targeted independent acts of sabotage beforehand, vehicle sabotage, homemade chemical munitions from cleaners, acid bottles, cyberattacks, homemade guns, or just real guns if they have them.< Nasty, nasty stuff. Do not quote me or put me on a watchlist, don't shoot the bloody messenger here. The punishment "death" for something is usually a deterrent, but this is not the situation where doubling down is a good idea. And it's a sign things are spiraling out of control badly for the regime when they're pulling out such insane measures, it's not working, and the grievances of the protesters are growing.
Exactly, remember Myanmar. The world was “deeply concerned™️” and the people were revolting for a strong 5 days, then the tanks started shooting and the bodies began to stack. Now everybody is silent and we have a new dictatorship in the world.
It probably will actually. The protestors aren’t actually revolting, they’re just protesting. So eventually the bastards in charge will have killed anyone who wants to protest and Iran will continue along with its shithole regime.
