In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Another Republican demands less government, less democracy. Every story is the same - Republicans are waging war on the United States, it's citizens, the Constitution and democracy itself. They attack all the pillars of democracy: public education, independent journalism, human rights, safe elections, equality and justice. Every story is the same. All good people are called to rise up and promote democracy in your house and defend it in your community. Rise up!
