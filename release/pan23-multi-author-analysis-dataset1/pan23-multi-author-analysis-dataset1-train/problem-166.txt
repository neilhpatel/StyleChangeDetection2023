Food taboo is a fundamental part of the ritual purity system in the Jewish tradition. Its form in Torah dates to before the exiles, but in the Hellenistic and early Roman periods it was gaining major prominence as a means of identity formation, because Judea was gaining a growing non-Jewish population, and because outside of Judea it was a visible way to set oneself apart from the gentile locals. Pork became the quintessential example because it was a relatively affordable meat and therefore one that Judeans could point to as stereotypically "gentile" food, so avoidance of it became a solid way for Judeans to assert their Judean-ness (Kraemer talks about this in Jewish Eating and Identity through the Ages).
So you have a movement that emerged in Galilee/Judea and is based in Jewish practices, but is spreading among people who don't necessarily have any particular need to identify themselves with Judeans writ large, AND don't have stringent ritual taboos around food as a basic cultural expectation. Plus there are a lot of questions about how much early Jesus followers cared about differentiating themselves from other gentiles. Most of our authors care about it a lot, but outside of that it's difficult to say, and there's evidence that at least some people weren't bothered about it.
Interesting. My understanding though was that, at the time, Judaism was a proselytizing religion that was seeking and getting converts throughout the Roman Empire. I know that after the Roman-Judean wars many Jews fled to Arabia where they were far more successful at proselytizing, but how come Judaism didn't see such growth within the Roman Empire?
Very interesting. I honestly always believed that Pork, when under cooked, very easily causes food poisoning and parasites and just assumed that it found its way into the religion as a means to explain why people got sick eating it.
