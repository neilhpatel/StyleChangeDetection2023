I am. I‚Äôm 62. Still paying my school loan. One of the reasons I will never buy a house and have very little retirement. Most of these things will help me, if they are true. I‚Äôm single and lower middle class.
Republican superstar Reagan took time out of covert scandaling to normalize actively trying to kill people before retirement, and each generation of Republican after has taken that to a level of horror.
