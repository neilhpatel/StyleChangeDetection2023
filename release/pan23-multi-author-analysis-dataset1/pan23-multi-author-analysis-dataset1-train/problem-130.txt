In Edessa, for example, Godfrey of Bouillon’s brother Baldwin of Boulogne founded the first crusader state, and their cousin Baldwin of Bourcq also ruled there. Both Baldwin I and II married Armenian women. Another cousin, Joscelin of Courtenay, succeeded Baldwin II and also had an Armenian wife.
Baldwin I and II both ruled in Jerusalem as well, and Baldwin II’s children were all half-Armenian, including his successor Queen Melisende. So these part Flemish/Frankish/Armenian rulers also intermarried with the Courtenay, who were likewise part French and part Armenian. Two of Melisende’s granddaughters became queen as well - one, Sibylla, married an Italian, William of Montferrat. The other, Isabella, had a Greek mother, and she married into the Montferrat family too. So now we’re up to a Flemish/Frankish/Armenian/Italian/Greek dynasty!
Godfrey and Baldwin, the first and second rulers of the new Kingdom of Jerusalem, were from Lorraine. But the anonymous who wrote the Gesta Francorum could use that title (lit. 'Deeds of the Franks') to describe their crusade, because of the wider sense of the term Franks. Note too that Frederick II of Germany -- of the house of Hohenstaufen -- ruled as King of Jerusalem in the thirteenth century. So quite a few 'Germans' ruled the crusader states (and I'm not even going to mention the ones established by the Italian maritime republics). But authors at the time frequently called them simply 'Franks', to distinguish them from Greeks and/or Muslims.
