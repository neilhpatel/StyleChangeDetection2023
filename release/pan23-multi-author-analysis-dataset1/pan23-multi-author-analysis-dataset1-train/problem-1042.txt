The term 'Panthay Rebellion' is a useful shorthand, but also a somewhat misleading one. Firstly, 'Panthay' is very much an exonym, originating from British colonial authorities based in Burma, rather than a self-appellation. For the most part, Muslims in the southwestern regions called themselves Hui å›ž, a distant corruption of 'Uyghur'. That's not to say that they were all actually of Turkic origin, indeed many, particularly in the northwestern provinces of Gansu and Shaanxi, were descended from Han Chinese converts. Secondly, there was not a singular, coherent rebellion. David Atwill, in his study of the uprisings, discerns three separate rebel tendencies, roughly corresponding to Yunnan's three major geographical divisions: a western portion centred on Dali, an eastern portion centred on Yunnan-fu (now known as Kunming), and a southern portion centred on Pu'er (of tea fame) and Lin'an. They by no means acted in concert, although their original motives were indeed broadly aligned. Thirdly, it was not only Muslims, but indeed a large portion of the province's population which included Han Chinese and, crucially, aboriginals, that rebelled.
Thanks so much! I do have one follow up question though. Did Muslims in other parts of China (or outside of China) know or care about the rebellion in Yunnan? I know that the Dungan revolt was happening in northwest China around this time, so did the rebels in Gansu or Shaanxi express any support for the Hui in Yunnan?
