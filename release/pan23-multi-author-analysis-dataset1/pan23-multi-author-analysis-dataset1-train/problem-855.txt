Nonetheless, there was significant anxiety from the French that the absence of their language at San Francisco (owing to Nazi occupation and De Gaulle's marginalisation at that point) would lead to French potentially losing its status as a diplomatic lingua franca, or at best serve as a distant second to English. Le Monde describes the first plenary meeting, where French was made equivalent to English after a lenhy debate. Notably, the Chinese delegate asserted that should English not serve as the only official language, then Chinese would have to be used; Honduras followed likewise with Spanish, as did Portugal. Some interesting rhetoric was used by the French delegate, who asked if the rest, "like Hitler... too wanted to condemn France". What Le Monde leaves out is the support from the Chilean, Venezuelan and Peruvian delegate that French should be used, while the Chinese representative remained more skeptical but drew a distinction between 'official' and 'working' languages as a compromise should all negotiations be carried out in English.
Oh, thank you for that bibliography! I wonder whether there was a challenge from the Non-aligned Movement during the Cold War over language usage in the UN, but that's probably a separate question altogether...
