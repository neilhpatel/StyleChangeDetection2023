Thank you! There isn't anything wrong with the power lines, they just wanted new ones in and destroyed our backyard in the process. I will be talking to them today.
And the reason they went to your neighbor and then you is because the workers are human too and while they may have the ultimate right to access due to easements that they could potentially exercise on any given yard, your neighbor came out of the gate making it known that they were going to be a colossal pain in the ass about it and they decided that the juice wasn't worth the squeeze and went to go do what they needed to do from a different side/yard.
NAL but I work for DTE in Michigan. (We do the other half of the state). As other commentora have stated, the utility company should fix it. However, I would recommend getting an arborist or tree specialist to age the apple tree/value it. Take so many pictures.
If you contact the power company and don't get a satisfactory response, elevate it to a complaint at the state regulatory body for utilities (the Michigan Public Utility Commission in your case). The PUC does not like dealing with landowner complaints, and they do regulate the utility, so the utility will try to make them happy by making you happy.
