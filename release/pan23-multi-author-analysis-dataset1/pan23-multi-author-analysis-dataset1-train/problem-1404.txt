"This is a statement of the condition of the premises you have leased or rented. You should read it carefully in order to see if it is correct. If it is correct you must sign it. This will show that you agree that the list is correct and complete. If it is not correct, you must attach a separate signed list of any damage which you believe exists in the premises. This statement must be returned to the lessor or his agent within fifteen days after you receive this list or within fifteen days after you move in, whichever is later. If you do not return this list, within the specified time period, a court may later view your failure to return the list as your agreement that the list is complete and correct in any suit which you may bring to recover the security deposit.''.
Yeah, I was just realizing that… it says they have to give us the filled-out statement of condition and the deadline is 10 days after tenancy begins, nothing about the tenant having the right to inspect the premises before signing it… still an extremely scummy thing to do and might at least cast doubt to their character in court.
2. Provide you with notice of deductions in your deposit within 30 days - this must have a written description of the damage and an estimate of the repair cost.
(iii) whether repairs were performed to remedy such damage, the dates of said repairs, the cost thereof, and receipts therefor.
