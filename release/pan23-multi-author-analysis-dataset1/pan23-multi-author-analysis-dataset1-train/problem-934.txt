In my own experience of 20 years in the industry in various countries in Europe five guys with less experience PLUS one very good guy can indeed replace one very good guy: you need that one very good guy to mentor the 5 juniors and meanwhile he's not going to be doing much high value work so the result adds up to much the same as just the one very good guy if left alone.
yes and no. Companies are simply interested in bringing in the people who will work for less. Considering many make much less than what Germany is offering, its a win win.
I suspect the cats might enhance his productivity, unlike having to mentor 5 junior guys if there are expectations that the normal work will keep on getting done alongside this (and the kind of management that thinks 5 juniors devs can replace a senior devs is exactly the kind that believes the fantasy that mentoring juniors costs no time hence the rest of the work will still be done).
When did this change? I got a 2nd line IT job with the Telekom in '98 with no degree at all, nor vocational training. All I had was a year's prior experience.
It's an investment in the 5 juniors, but if the mindset of the company is of trying to replace experienced but expensive people with cheap ones those 5 junior, after becoming more senior will probably respond to such a disloyal company with an equal level of loyalty and just leave for a better offer.
