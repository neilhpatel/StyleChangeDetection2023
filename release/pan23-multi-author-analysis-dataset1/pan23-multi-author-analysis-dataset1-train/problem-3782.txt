I think it's terrible if neither number works. What's the point of posting them if they are wrong? Crazy.
So the cop (she) called my best friend to say they were “pressing charges” and made her (my friend) take the post down(friend had shared the news article/link stating he had felony child abuse charges and the 3 year old would have died if she the child stayed in the home) .
I had a cop call me the other day and tell me my ex was “a good guy” and an “innocent man” because my friend shared the article about him being a child abuser in a fb group that he was actively posting in, to try protect other people (he lies and doesn’t tell anyone his charges or past). I do not want another officer of all people to tell me that this dude is a good man because he isn’t.
And then cop called me to ask my “involvement “ with the post and I argued with the cop for about 20 minutes because cop said that he’s an innocent man etc. when his trial is literally in June and the only reason he’s not in jail is because his mom bailed him out.
