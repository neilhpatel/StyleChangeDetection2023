Yes. I had a gas line in my kitchen capped and electric installed, partly because we didn't feel comfortable at the idea of the child turning gas to the burners on. The dials were at waist level. The air quality was a concern.
Really? I've been wanting a gas stove for a while. I have a gas water heater on the other side of the wall. Maybe I should get a quote. I assumed it would be too expensive.
Republicans believe in hierarchy. There are the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, the healthy and the sick. And where you land in those hierarchies is just who you are. No one did anything to put you there, no system caused you to land there. You are poor or weak or sick because of who you are, period.
