Jordan has an incredibly large Palestinian refugee population (roughly 33% of their total population are Palestinian refugees) and most of them have naturalized into Jordan and are already citizens, in fact its said that a good chunk of the Jordanians, probably more than half of the entire population, are descendants of Palestinian refugees, either partly or fully.
Thanks! It seems to me like a lot of people would put their personal economic situation ahead of nationalist interests and want to go someplace with better personal prospects. I would think people in Lebanon's refugee camps would have an interest in going anywhere they could get jobs and so on, for example, so the continued existence of those made me wonder if no other country even let them in.
