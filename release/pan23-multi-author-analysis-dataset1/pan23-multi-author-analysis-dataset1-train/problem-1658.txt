The monster wasn't always under the bed. Or in the closet, or the wardrobe. Historical literature has a vast array of accounts of people, sometimes old but mostly very young children, scared of the things that breathed in the darkness or threatened to snatch them up. The syntax of where, exactly, the monster would be shifted according to the context of daily life - and sleeping accommodations and habits shifted over time. So while it would be a bit reductive to say "you can't have a monster under the bed if you don't have a bed," there's a certain degree of truth to the historical fact that the now-popular image of a single child alone at night in their own bed in their own room wasn't exactly the historical norm.
Who is Marian F. Bonner? Why would she be in the audience for this story? It sounds like HP is using the royal we. Seems like he has no shame writing to people about his nightmares, since he also wrote that letter to Mr Finlay. Was this part of an exchange of dreams?
Judging by newspaper accounts, general awareness of "monsters under the bed" or in the closet increased in the early 20th century; the developing field of child psychology probably helped considerably, but by about mid-century you start to see a lot more standardization of the idea of monsters—usually very atypical monsters, that is not the standard vampires or werewolves but usually much more poorly defined critters—in closets and under beds.
