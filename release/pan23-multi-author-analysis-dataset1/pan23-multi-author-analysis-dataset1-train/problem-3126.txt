And on top of that, from your link: "In the Sheikh Jarrah case, the evictions are based on the claim that the residents have not paid rent to the owner of the properties, now an Israeli nongovernmental organization called Nahalat Shimon. Sheikh Jarrah is an area that Jews refer to as Shimon Hatzadik; it was a predominantly, but not exclusively, Jewish neighborhood before the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which led to Israel’s establishment and the division of Jerusalem. The properties in question are located in the sector of the city that was under Jordanian control after the 1948 war.".
It’s “funny” that “leftists” Israeli who blocked highways and burned some woods in the middle of the road last Saturday night to opposes the Israeli government anti democracy plan were called as anarchist and throwing tantrum and all the bad stuff by probably the same people who supported this settlers violence behavior burning random cars on the street. And they probably praise this settlers behavior as an act of heroism.
Exactly. That’s why there are jewish archeological sites in Israel/Judea and Samaria that are dated thousands of years before there was any Palestine. LMAO.
