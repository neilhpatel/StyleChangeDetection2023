In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Like the US. Blacks have been second class citizens from the moment they gained their freedom. It was codified until the 1960s, and has been de facto with banking and housing discrimination, mass incarceration, and as recently as this past election, direct disenfranchisement.
Naa. Maybe Israeli actions are contributing to antisemitism but it’s not antisemitism to point out that there are people out there who are being mistreated.
I don’t like Hamas but I’ve had this argument enough times and done enough research to know that Israelis started the conflict. I’m not just talking about forcibly taking land, I’m talking about terroristic attacks.
Since when is fighting back against an attacker and oppressor “terrorism”? There are plenty of incidents where Jewish people rightfully fought the Germans before and during WWII. Does that make the Jewish people terrorists or heroes? I say heroes.
So why is 1/5th of Israel Palestinian who legally hold the exact same rights as anyone else, 360,000 Palestinians live freely with no separation in Jerusalem, Palestinians make up about 20% of the government, and Palestinians are apart of (but are not conscripted) the military? That doesn't sound very apartheid to me.
The Palestinian Authority promotes apartheid beliefs by making women second class citizens (same as Israelis making Palestinians Such) and willfully support the cleansing of homosexuals. This can be said of the majority of Muslim states - Iran, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Yemen, Pakistan, etc.
