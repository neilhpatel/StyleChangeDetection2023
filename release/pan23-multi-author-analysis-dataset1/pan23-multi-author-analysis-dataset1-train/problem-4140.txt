Eh, not sure that I agree. Upstate NY, outside of a couple cities, is deep red, and they hated Cuomo, and hate Hochul, with a fiery passion. And I haven't kept up with it as much since I've moved from NY, but my understanding is that she has had more than her fair share of controversies so far. That won't help her with any voter, by any means.

Exactly. The chair of the state party spent more money trying to make sure on corrupt Buffalo mayor Byron Brown’s write-in campaign after he lost his primary to a more progressive challenger than he spent on Hochul’s STATEWIDE campaign this year for governor.
