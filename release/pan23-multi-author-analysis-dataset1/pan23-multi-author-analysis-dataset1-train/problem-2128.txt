Here is the abstract: "The decision in 1847 to cut Treasury spending on public relief efforts during the Irish famine is generally attributed by economic historians to the pervasive influence of ‘laissez‐faire’ ideas on the Whig government of Lord John Russell. This article draws on the papers of political leaders and contemporary financial information to argue that economic reasons were the trigger for the change in policy. Robert Peel and Charles Wood's macroeconomic policies of the 1840s, including the gold standard, the Bank Charter Act, and corn law repeal, left the Whigs unable to borrow to finance relief efforts in Ireland without panicking markets. The scaling back of public assistance programmes that resulted from this—and which increased mortality at the height of the Irish famine—was the unintended result of Peel and Wood's economic policies, in the context of the Whig government's parliamentary weakness.".

I had not but I have now - thanks for the suggestion! I agree with your view and Read's article details it excellently; he argues that the inﬂuence of laissez-faire ideas doesn't give a complete explanation for the decisions that were made at the time and argues that the idea that the government’s economic policy during the famine was driven by ideological issues alone is unconvincing. Basically, there was a lot happening in Britain's economy that ended up having negative repercussions for Ireland, even if unintentional. The main reason I emphasise the impact of laissez-faire was to explain why government assistance wasn't extended beyond 1847 - even when it was obvious that the famine wasn't 'over' - in order to challenge the genocide argument.
