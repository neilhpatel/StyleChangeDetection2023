I'll start with Abkhazia: the Abkhaz as an ethnic group are closely related to the peoples of the northwest Caucasus like the Circassians. They have been around for millennia (some Georgian historians dispute that, but they are very much in the minority), and speak a distinct language (again, related to the northwest Caucasus). Abkhazia was one of the last parts of the Caucasus to be fully incorporated into the Russian Empire, only really doing so in the 1860s, though they have long had a close relationship with Georgia.
From Conflict to Autonomy in the Caucasus: The Soviet Union and the Making of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno Karabakh by Ars√®ne Saparov. Looks at the early Bolshevik actions to establish the states.
It was not until the Bolsheviks arrived that a South Ossetian state was established. A lot of Ossetians were peasants, while most landowners were ethnic Georgians (though I'll be clear, a lot of Georgians were peasants, too), so the Bolsheviks exploited this difference to help with their activities in Georgia (which was an independent republic from 1918 to 1921 before being annexed by the Bolsheviks). A South Ossetian autonomous oblast (a Russian word meaning province; one step below autonomous republic in the Soviet hierarchy) was established within Georgia, but during the Soviet era nothing much happened with it.
That was a good answer. As a Georgian a lot of things are true about this, but one fact that everyone seems to ignore is that Georgians suffered FAR worse during the years of independence. 250 K Georgian civilians were ethnically cleansed with the support in Russia just in 1991-1992. And further 30k from S. O. in 2008. Please just include this in your answer to make sure that its more accurate.
