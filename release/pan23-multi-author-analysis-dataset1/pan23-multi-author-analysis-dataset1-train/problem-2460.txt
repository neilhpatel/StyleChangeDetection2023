Hmm. No details, but if 150 eagles is a reason to STOP pursuing clean energy for the population of the US, the numbers don't make any sense....150 v 300 million (US only). How many people in Houston die from lung disease from living near refineries or even Midland / Odessa where gas is burned nightly? Just asking.

I think it's more like, the oil industry hates clean energy sources because more clean energy == less oil revenues, and Trump is a cheap piece of shit whose opinions and positions (a lot of them at least) are bought by corporates, so when you see him barking at environmentalists and things like clean energy, it's really because like all corrupted right-wing politicians he's loyal to the filthy corporates and billionaires and not the population.
