i have another car. my dad told me i had nothing to worry about on the claim. honestly my dad fucked me over on this completely. i sent him the money to cover the premium (this should have included me under the policy) and he didn’t. knowing i’m not under the insurance and the fact that i’m paying for it myself and not him just sickens me knowing that my own father has essentially ruined me financially. it wasn’t until today that i found out i wouldn’t be covered. so i bought another car with the rest of the money i had saved up thinking the honda i totaled would be paid out for. so i’m now going to be stuck making payments on 2 cars. be straight up lied to me and told me i had coverage when i don’t. and now it looks like there’s nothing i can do about this situation. i’m sick to my stomach.
By the way, if the car is being stored at a tow lot or body shop pending claim disposition, it'd be a good idea to get it stored at your place or somewhere cheaper, where it won't rack-up daily storage fees while you and your mom figure out what to do about it.
