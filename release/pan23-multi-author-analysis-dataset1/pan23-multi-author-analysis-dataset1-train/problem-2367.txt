Once president, Truman certainly did pay more attention to the Mighty Mo than other ships; on his initial visit to the Map Room, his very first question to George Elsey in their long working relationship was about reports of kamikaze damage to her since "he had friends on the ship." I don't remember if Elsey mentions anything about the Missouri getting a special colored pin the way that FDR's sons did earlier in the war to make their locations easier to see, but there's little doubt that he kept an eye on her for the next few months, and there's a big grin on his face in the picture of Forrestal and Admiral King presenting him with a model of the ship once he took office.
Iowa would have been the simplest alternative. But it would have meant an additional round if flag transfers in the midst if entering a hostile harbor or just before. That same reason more or less eliminates any carrier as it was a risk too far. Tokyo Bay was still full of mines and Japanese Pilots had been required to guide the task Force in with minesweeping only just begun.
They theoretically could have done it on one of the CVLs that came into Tokyo Bay with the surface combatants and landing forces. But that also wouldn't have been near as daunting imagery and there was no way a Fleet Carrier would have been sent into the harbor just for it.
