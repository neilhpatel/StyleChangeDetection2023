In terms of what your rights are now: you don't really have any until the kid is born. You aren't entitled to medical info, being at doctor visits, or being there when the kid is born. You also aren't entitled to name the kid. You might one day be able to go to court and get the baby's last name hyphenated (her last name + yours) unless she just gives it your last name, but first name will be her choice. Make sure to get a paternity test before you agree to anything because if you sign the birth certificate, it doesn't matter if a DNA test later says you aren't the dad, unless it's only been a few months in the eyes of the legal system you have accepted responsibility and will be on the hook until it's 18.
former drug dealer stripper homeless. didnâ€™t know any of that until after we started dating. yeah hindsight is 20/20. you try finding a girl in the bay area thats not at least one of the three. do you think the fact that she has almost nothing to offer this kid and the 3000 miles between us will have any bearing on their decision?
