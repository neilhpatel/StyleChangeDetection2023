Covid 22. I have been reading some about what’s happening in China and it sounds pretty fucking scary. Who’s to say what kinda variants are gonna come out of the spread there. And eventually make it over here by late Feb. its almost as scary as the beginning of the pandemic.

You’re absolutely correct. Humanity, considering its awful strategy to beat this, did get quite lucky that it’s been mutating to be less deadly while becoming more contagious. So, not worse. Though not a lot better.
There is a valid argument to be made that since the most virulent periods are early when the host is not feeling the more severe health effects, that it won't be selected to become less deadly, but that still doesn't establish an advantageous situation for it to become more deadly. The original SARS outbreak is an interesting case study into a highly contagious virus, but way more deadly than COVID.
