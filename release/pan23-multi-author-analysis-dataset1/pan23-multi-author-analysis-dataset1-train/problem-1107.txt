There are two competing issues here. One is your child has the right to be educated. The second is every other kid in the class has the right to be educated. Both will be spelled out in the state's statutes.
And to really put the icing on the cake, since he is on the younger side of his grade level (his birthday is only a month before school starts) - at the end of last year, I suggested keeping him in kindergarten an extra year so he could have a "normal" year instead of the mixed distance learning/in person instruction like last year - and was told he would be just fine, he was ready for 1st grade.
That's someplace to start. It's hard to not be sympathetic to you, and it's hard to not be sympathetic to the teacher as well. Keep in mind (and you probably know this) an IEP or 504 can include a shorter school day than the 230. Good luck.
Children with behavioral issues have learned that overtly terrible behavior is the only tool in their toolbox when they're unhappy/frustrated, etc. Make a scene, and something's going to change. The key is to give them more tools. A skilled behavioral specialist (like it sounds like you have now) will spend much of the day teaching their students that there are many alternatives to just losing their shit. I would suggest staying in constant contact with the new teacher--instead of just asking, "How is my son doing?" ask "What should I be doing at home to reinforce what you're working on in class?" Every SPED teacher worth a damn uses the same terminology consistently when negative behaviors surface, and what terminology they use to reinforce positive behaviors. You need to know these terms and practices and do exactly the same at home--otherwise, you'll have a kid that doesn't want to go to school. Once they realize there's a standard expectation, and they're loved, we'll see a reduction in negative behaviors, and some mind-blowing growth on the positive side.
