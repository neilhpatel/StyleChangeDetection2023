NAL- I have a daughter about your age. I wouldn’t be happy if I found out she was having an affair with an adult but I would not be mad at her. I would be upset that an adult took advantage of her and convinced her to put herself in a dangerous and compromising position. Report him, for yourself and any other young children he is doing this to. You have nothing to be ashamed of. He is the adult and 100 percent knows what he is doing is wrong. And if he has a child, then it’s his fault for putting himself in a position to hurt his own child, that is on him-not you. Your parents will get over the shock, you also need help because it sounds like your feelings for this man are still clouding your judgment. He is a pedophile, especially if he messing with a middle schooler. Report him.
