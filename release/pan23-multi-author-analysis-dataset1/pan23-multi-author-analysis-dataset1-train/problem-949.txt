And taxes were already taken out. So you’d have to “pay” the amount after taxes right? Smh. This is on them not you. Definitely get advice from a lawyer. It was their screw up. Good luck.
I might worry that HR didn't have the authority to make such a statement, but regardless I don't think it changes the scenario that the employee relied in good faith on someone in the Company that is generally held out as having authority over these matters.
"Look. You screwed up. I called HR. They said it was correct. In reliance on that, I bought a car. Here's what I'll do: I'll sell the car and buy, approximately, the same car that I had before. And then I'll pay the difference back to the company. But, that's all I owe you, because that's what puts me back into the same position that I would have been had you not screwed up. Or, you can just have the car." That's approximately the same thing you'd be looking for in court if they were to sue you for the money. \[It's a little harder if you also put other money into the car, but the idea is the same: Put me back into the position I would have been in had you not screwed up and I had not relied on your misstatements.\].
