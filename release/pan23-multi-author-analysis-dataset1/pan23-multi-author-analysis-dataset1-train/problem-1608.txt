But to be serious for a moment, if you're interested in Qing onward, the best introduction is still Jonathan Spence's The Search for Modern China, which goes from the fall of the Ming up to the end of the 20th century. He does fall a little into the Opium War trap as well, but at least he covers a lot of what goes before. Personally, for a couple of more specialised topics, I'd recommend Julia Lovell's The Opium War as something that gives a lot of context to the war and its legacy; Stephen Platt's Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom as probably the best introduction out there to the Taiping Civil War; and Peter C. Perdue's China Marches West as an extremely compelling and comprehensive account of how the Qing Dynasty conquered Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, how they consolidated their hold, and how they crafted their imperial ideology.
...That's because we don't have a good one. People are still recommending Johan Huizinga, The Autumn of the Middle Ages/The Waning of the Middle Ages, and the Dutch original of that was published LITERALLY a century ago. 1919.
I'm currently reading Diarmaid Macolluch's book on the Protestant Reformation. It's great! Anyone have suggestions for more books on the Protestant REformation, as well as Early Christianity (perhaps even, all of Christianity)?
