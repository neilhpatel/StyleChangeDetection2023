Mississippi has implied consent, like many states, which means when you drive a car there you agree to submit to testing by the state upon reasonable request. So when you refuse field sobriety tests and breath, blood and/or urine tests they can criminally charge you for violating implied consent laws and suspend your license. In my state the penalties are the exact same as a DWI.
You are correct I consented to a breathalyzer but for some reason I don't know the police officer never administered one either there at my vehicle doing the arrest or at the police station as for it being documented I'm not sure but There were several officers around me and the arresting officer when I consented to the breathalyzer and refused to do the fields sobriety test ( I just didn't want to look like a fool they're on the side of the road Petting my head and touching my nose, is the reason for the refusal ).
You are going to need an attorney. If you go to court without one and it’s not dismissed ask for a continuance and get an attorney. Because I’m willing to bet they will claim you refused.
