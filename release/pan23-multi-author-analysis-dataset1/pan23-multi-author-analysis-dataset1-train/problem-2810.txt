Let’s not forget Matt Susin from the Brevard County School Board. He misrepresented COVID data from Parish Medical in a way that fit his agenda which then forced Parish to issue a letter stating that due to the school boards misrepresentation of that data, they would no longer be releasing said data. He took values out of context, declared COVID over and dropped masks. He is an idiot and I am embraced that he is on the school board.
So they’re whipping their base into a frenzy by turning us into the bad guys of a moral panic, and many of them are armed and believe (or at least are starting to believe) that the federal government as it is is illegitimate, plus they’re slowly taking our access to life saving medical care and trying to expunge and mention of us throughout the culture sphere.
Yes! People are incredible mislead. Tragically, so that these laws will get people killed. These politicians are screwing with peoples lives for the sake of power. They don't care and they want people to be ignorant. Why do you think they want all information removed from schools?
