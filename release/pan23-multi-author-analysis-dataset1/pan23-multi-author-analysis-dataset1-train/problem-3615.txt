They actually can, very easily. They get about .56 cents back from the Fed for every dollar that they contribute. Doing the napkin math, the Fed could fund this 100% and it would still be 100% NJ tax dollars paying for it. Sound fair?
Housing should cost.however housing as an investing vehicle where people own 3+residential homes should be heavily discouraged as it creates artificial scarcity and drives prices up dramatically at the lowest levels.
...right. But it looks like we've already decided that tax dollars go where they are needed in the country. I am merely saying that if you have an issue with NJ taking out of state tax dollars to feed children then I hope you are just as vehemently opposed to the way that this is already happening.
