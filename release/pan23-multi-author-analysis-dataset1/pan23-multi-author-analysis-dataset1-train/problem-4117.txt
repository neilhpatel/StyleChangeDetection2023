I’m a bit confused by hearing that the Republican Party considers the results of the midterm election a disaster where they have regained control of Congress but failed to retake control of the senate, in which in my view the democrat party won’t be able to accomplish anything because the republicans party will do everything they can to stop the democrats from passing any their agenda, so what I’m missing here,how is this a good thing for the democrats party.
