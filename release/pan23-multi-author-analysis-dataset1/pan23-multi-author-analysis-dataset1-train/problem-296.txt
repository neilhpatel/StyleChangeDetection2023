Understanding the broader point you are making here, one cant help but feel you are referencing a specific historical motif or event. Care to elaborate?
In addition to "travel professionals" who got paid to help other people travel, many of whom would nevertheless have been themselves stationary, improvements in medieval travel also benefited from the increase in professional travelers, that is, messengers and diplomats. Experience over the same route is an obvious factor, especially for royal-papal couriers. The later Middle Ages saw a reduction in peripatetic (moving) courts, meaning it was much more possible to travel the same route over and over and over for years. Even in the less centralized Holy Roman Empire, the numbers of cities that hosted the Reichstag (parliament) gradually decreased over the 15th-16th centuries until it was, for all practical purposes, a Regensburg institution. The first post-Roman organized postal service in the west comes out of the HRE around 1500, reflecting the normalization of standard routes and the professionalization of a messenger corps.
