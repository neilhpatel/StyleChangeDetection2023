Honestly don't care what she was going through it was her choice to break the law in another country that any reasonable individual would have seen the potential risk she was taking in a place that convicts 99 percent of those with weed charges and it is still illegal here so I don't see why she was worth trading a merchant of death for.

How does it help? Cause It fucking doesn't. What you're saying is we should worry about the dummies abroad breaking other countries laws that we still uphold over a literal international arms dealer.
yay??? Maybe dont bring drugs to countries that have harsh laws against them? Celebrate trading a basketball player for a 'merchant of death'? ehhhhhhh, great for Griner but really not much to celebrate here.
