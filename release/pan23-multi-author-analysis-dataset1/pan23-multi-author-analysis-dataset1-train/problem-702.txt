It was not until the work of Thierry brothers (Augustin and Amédée), and further, Jules Michelet (1798-1874) that gave the Gauls very positive traits (Wood 2013: 102-106). (Added): The modern concept of the nationalism and modern historical science originated in Germany itself flowed into France several times in the 19th century, especially after the defeat of Napoleon and the Franco-Prussian War, so I suppose the re-evaluation of the Gauls as an ancestor of the French nation was also a part of this trend.
Fascinating stuff all around! How were Bretons made to fit into this new conception of the French nation as essentially "Gaulish"? On the one hand, they still spoke a Celtic language, which would give them a certain credible kinship with the ancient Gauls, at least in national-romantic terms; on the other hand, however, the ancestors of the Bretons were not the ancient Gauls, but rather Brythonic Celts who had migrated to Northern France from the British Isles between the Late Roman Period and the Early Middle Ages (indeed, Breton is similar to Cornish and, to a lesser degree, to Welsh).

So basically, over the 19th century, they went from being revered as the living legacy of the glory of the ancient Gauls to being disdained as lowly, unassimilated interlopers from the land of France's historical enemy to boot? If that's an accurate understanding of how the Bretons' reputation fell over the course of the century, that sounds so sad.
