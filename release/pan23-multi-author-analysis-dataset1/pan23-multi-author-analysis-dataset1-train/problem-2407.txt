That’s terrifying and fascinating, and as much as I hate admitting it, if Donald Trump had won and started that shit in America, he’d be enjoying 47% support as long as he threw the city folk in the meat grinder.
They are not. Ukrainians and Russians are different people. Just because they used to belong to the same political polity thirty years ago, doesn't mean they are family. Georgians, Armenians and Kazaks etc. also belonged to the USSR and the Empire yet they don't consider each other family... The " we are family" is Russian propaganda. Ukrainians choose Europe.
That's irrelevant. No sympathy for these Nazi conscripts. They had a choice - die in Russia standing up for what's right, or die in Ukraine but kill innocent men/women/children first. Most chose the latter. Cowards, the lot of them.
Yugoslav wars are often very poorly researched, especially outside former Yugoslavia, and foreigners often only look them through their own perspective; aka the Dutch will focus on their battalion in Srebrenica, Americans on their bombing of Serbia and Montonegro during Kosovo war.
I know many people who have done it. I live amongst many Russians that have fled. Meet them every-day, talk to them about the situation back home. While I my self personally am not Russian, I have extended family in Russia. I am working at trying to get one of them out now. I can comfortably say If I was Russian, I would simply move to the Caucus or C.Asia. It is not difficult to do.
