Why was being related to Turkish such an attractive theory? I thought Hungary and Ottomans generally had an antagonistic relationship, and add in the religious difference and the general decline of the Ottomans, it doesn't seem like a natural choice. Was it mostly the "Eurasian steppe nomadic conqueror" image that you mentioned?
After the Second World War, the (again since there were various “versions” of state socialism in Hungary, with oftentime different approaches to the same matter, I am talking in general terms) Hungarian communist governments, unlike many others, mostly had a consistently anti-nationalist stance, so in the case of linguistics generally the accepted scientific consensus was promoted. Also since book publishing was strongly regulated, the “alternative hypotheses” didn’t really get any voice. On the other hand among the vibrant Hungarian emigrant communities in the West these theories proved to be immensely popular.
Also there signs that very questionable, wild theories about the origins of the Hungarian language proved to be resilient and were popular during the era. For instance, famous poet Mihály Babits parodied these attempts in Káp isten (‘The God of Káp’) in which he “demonstrated” that there many random words in Hungarian that starts with ‘káp’, so there must have been a God of Káp in the Old Hungarian pantheon.
