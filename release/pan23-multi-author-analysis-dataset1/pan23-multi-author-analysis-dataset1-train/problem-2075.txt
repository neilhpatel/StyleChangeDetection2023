Have you considered the possibility that your family is making part (or all) of this story up? It's awfully dramatic and far-fetched. Have you with your own eyes seen insurance paperwork for this payout? Did you with your own eyes see the $25,000 in cash?

thanks. a lot of people's advice so far has been to keep pushing on the police so i'll talk to her to do that. it's hard sometimes convincing older relatives to be smarter with their money especially when they grew up poor / immigrated to the states / have weird biases about listening to people younger than them. i doubt she lost the money from gambling though since she's never gambled extensively the last 70+ years of her life. i live out of state from her though so who knows always a possibility but it's one i'm doubtful of.
