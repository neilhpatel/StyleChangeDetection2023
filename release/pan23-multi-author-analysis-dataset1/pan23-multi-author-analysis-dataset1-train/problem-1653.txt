This essay was included in the collection "Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture" and was written by Gayatri Chakravorti Spivak; it's in part a metacriticism of academically fashionable writing on Eurocentrism.
ha! I came back to this comment because I thought you would be able to answer this perfectly, I am writing an essay now on the "can the subaltern speak" and my teacher has edited my thesis down, and wants me to include another author we have read this year, I am between Fanon, Ahrdent, and Marx. Any suggestion?
The biggest part of her argument, which isn't so clearly implicated in the line you cite, is about just which voices from the non-Western world get listened to; that Eurocentric historians give priority to, for example, Indian elites with Western academic pedigrees-- effectively rendering voiceless the mass of people who don't participate in the Western established fora of political thought and discussion. In particular she explores the question of where women fit in this-- perhaps the most famous line from the work is the notion that the colonial enterprise was justified by the notion "White men are saving brown women from brown men"; but that's a different thread of this tapestry of arguments and references than you were asking about.
you kick ass bro. Thank you for this. I really enjoyed reading this text and I couldnt have put it better " rhetorical complexification". I appreciate your time, good sir.
