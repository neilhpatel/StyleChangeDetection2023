One of the biggest threats to the Netherlands right now, and our security services agree, are far-right extremists who may commit terrorist attacks. We also call them "tokkies" which is similar to the English word "chav". They're very dumb people who tend to live off unemployment benefits and spend their time on Facebook finding some way to make every topic about Mark Rutte or Sigrid Kaag. Then they go back to their Telegram groups with other neo-Nazis for instructions. It's very sad.
I can't imagine something more embarrassing for an elite state-run hacker team than getting recorded through your own cameras, that you stupidly put up in your work area, failed to secure, and failed to monitor so badly that you didn't notice they were hacked and streaming to your enemy.
Yes and no. Many of them are outside the exclusive economic zone. So its more similar to a plane operated by a Dutch company.
