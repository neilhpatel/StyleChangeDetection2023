The most obvious answer is that they did not, the bulk of the trade between Rome and India was indeed done through the ports on Egypt's Red Sea--the so-called "maritime Silk Road". Maritime trade around the Arabian Peninsula has a long history, the earliest clear marker being pearls during the Neolithic, and famous early examples include the pharaohs Sneferu and Hatshepsut's expeditions to "Punt"--probably Somalia (worth noting these certainly did not constitute the sum total of exchange between pharaonic Egypt and the Red Sea, they are just well publicized examples). Ptolemaic Egypt began constructing ports on the Red Sea to facilitate the transport of elephants to be used in their armies, which was an important part of early hellenistic warfare, and the direct, monsoon route between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean was traditionally believed to have been discovered by the Ptolemaic sea captain Eudoxius, or perhaps Hippalus. During the Roman empire, this commerce expanded considerably, to the point that the Roman state derived considerable profit from tolls on the route, and the "Yavanas" (Greeks) bearing gold and wine are recording in the sangam poetry of south India. This commerce saw its pea around the middle of the first century CE, and experienced a sharp decline at the beginning of the second century, and nearly disappeared during the third century before experiencing a revival in Late Antiquity.
That's a great explanation! I have what might be a very silly question. We have the evidence for a sea route to India from Europe as early as the first century CE. Then why do we credit the discovery of the route more commonly to Vasco Da Gama? Was the route lost throughout the periods in between?
