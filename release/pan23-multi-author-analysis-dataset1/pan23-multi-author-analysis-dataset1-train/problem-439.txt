I'm missing the part where China or the "civilians" contacted the US and said "hey this huge three school bus sized balloon with sensors all over it is accidentally going to go over your airspace.".
If you've ever studied psychology the country of China is like your typical guy who is experiencing Inferiority complex. He knows hes nothing really ("made in China" is synonymous with being the worst quality in the world) but he puffs out his chest and creates an illusion of strenh. To the T.
It's unfortunate that for the sakes of continued security and safety of all public and private commercial or otherwise air traffic that all UFO of any type will be forced to be shot down to prevent mid air collisions between 20,000 and 40,000 feet of which these balloons have been found in within registered flight paths...
Great conversation there buddy. Maybe if you weren't parroting the issues you see in echo chambers while talking at people, rather than communicating and talking to people, then you would be in a much better place than ranting to a Peruvian living in Canada, who probably has a little bit better perspective of the world than you, due to having experienced issues outside your own bubbles throughout the past 30+ years.
Truly a shame but safety comes first. I'm sure China will understand that their balloons aren't as important as the lives of hundreds if not thousands of people both in the air and on the ground.
