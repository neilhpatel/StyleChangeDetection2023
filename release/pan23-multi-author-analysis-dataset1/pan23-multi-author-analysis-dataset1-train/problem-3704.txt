The EOB should show what CPT codes were billed for each revenue code, but you can also ask for an itemized bill. Typically the columns on an EOB will go in the order of revenue code — item description — CPT or HCPCS code — quantity — charge amount. A revenue code is the broader category, like 278 is for implants, 636 is for high-cost drugs, 360 is for OR procedures, etc. but the CPT or HCPCS will be specific to the service rendered. These codes are standardized and you can Google them!
Also, assuming that the charge is the actual allowed amount and the billing does not constitute fraud, waste, or abuse, the insurance company is not going to want to anger one of their in-network providers by denying the claim over something that was allegedly said to the OP over the phone beforehand.
IANAL. I work in family law now mostly, but have 20 years in medical office management and billing(in CA). Get the billing codes they used and if you can't get that from the clinic get the invoice they sent your insurance company. What you're probably going to find out is that the 'reasonable and customary' charges for telling someone to come in to be seen is not commensurate to what they're charging, at least not as you describe the services. Either they upcoded your call or they charged you for an in-person visit which did not occur. And honestly, if the clinic stonewalls you about any of this information I'd complain to the Washinon State Department of Health, and probably involve Facilities Licensing. If you're dealing with any kind of outside agency they aren't just going to dismiss your concerns the way the clinic will. This is pretty egregious.
The last time we were in a clinic twice in the same day, the clinic was not able to charge for the second visit as the insurance company said it was a continuation of care from the first visit and should be at no charge. The state prohibits balance billing, so we didn’t pay anything.
