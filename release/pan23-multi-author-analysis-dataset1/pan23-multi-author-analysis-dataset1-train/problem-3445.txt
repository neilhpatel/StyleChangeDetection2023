Hi there anyone interested in recommending things to OP While you might have a title to share, this is still a thread on /r/AskHistorians, and we still want the replies here to be to an /r/AskHistorians standard - presumably OP would have asked at /r/history or /r/askreddit if they wanted non-specialist opinion. So give us some indication why the thing you're recommending is valuable, trustworthy, or applicable Posts that provide no context for why you're recommending a particular podcast/book/novel/documentary/etc, and which aren't backed up by a historian-level knowledge on the accuracy and stance of the piece, will be removed.
scars of the conflict come from. Unfortunately I haven’t studied it enough to be sure of what I am saying, so instead I’ll provide some sources. After 48 you’ll see why Arab nationalism is important, as several wars break out between Israel and her neighbours.
To sum up, to understand the start of the conflict you need to study both Jewish and Arab movements before 1948. Furthermore, you should familiarise yourself with the history of the countries around Israel, since they contributed greatly to the conflict. In the end I don’t think you’ll come to a conclusion, academic history has many shades of grey, there’s theories and debates, and in the end, no one is ‘right’ in causing death and destruction, whichever your identity is.
