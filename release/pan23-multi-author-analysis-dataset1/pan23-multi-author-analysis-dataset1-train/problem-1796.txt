Members of Oppedisano's family also donated to Santos's campaign. His brother and niece, who run an Italian restaurant in Queens called Il Bacco, were appointed to Santos' Small Business coalition. Santos, who posted that he frequented Il Bacco on Instagram, spent more than $25,000 at the establishment on his campaign's dime since his first failed attempt to win a seat in Congress in 2020, according to FEC records. The disbursements were filed under meeting charges or food and beverage expenses between 2020 and 2022, covering both of Santos's races for office. The campaign also owed nearly $19,000 to the restaurant for an "Election Night Event.".
