So you should pull up a record of how many good faith efforts theyâ€™re doing and your energy bills. See if they will do something different.
If the humidity is not something the plants require or you don't want in your apartment, in addition to the portable window AC unit, I might suggest a dehumidifier as it can help reduce the humidity in your apartment and when light shines into your apartment, it won't have the humidity to help heat up the rooms as much. Maybe you could ask your apartment guy there if they have a dehumidifier to see if you can borrow one to see if it might help in also reducing the amount of heat in your apartment? Although it would make noise and need to be periodically emptied of water that it may collect, hopefully it would make a difference to the temperature in the apartment to something that is more comfortable to your liking. And hopefully your apartment's AC unit will actually get fixed and not break down so soon afterwards...or just get replaced with a new one. .
Ok. So knowing now that you likely have your unit outside, do any other apartment units in your building have the same problem as you do or is it just your unit seems to be failing as often as it seems to be? And as for the maintenance man, if you're wearing a smile when you see him, he'd likely enjoy seeing you as often as he is, but just not for this reason I would guess. .
