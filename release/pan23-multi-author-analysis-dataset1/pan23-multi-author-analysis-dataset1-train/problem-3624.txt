We are far enough to be a good choice, and we have always been jewish friendly (the number of jewish people in Buenos Aires is top three after Israel and New York)... AND nazi friendly.
Exactly. People have been selling goods to save their life since time immemorial. The descendants should think about how they are alive today because their family member was so prescient as to leave Germany. The whole family could very well have been wiped out, as many of our Jewish cousins were. Isn’t that worth the 100 million valuation today? The life of your children and grandchildren?
Exactly! Like I mentioned, who knows who is who, maybe some fled and wanted to live in peace with a new identity and still live there till this day or have new families in the blood lines… USA does the same - Lots of high profile soldiers have new names and lives… ya think these people stay public? Ugh I don’t think so..
Argentinian here. Truth is, we have always been flexible with our borders. Everything and everyone can come and go.
