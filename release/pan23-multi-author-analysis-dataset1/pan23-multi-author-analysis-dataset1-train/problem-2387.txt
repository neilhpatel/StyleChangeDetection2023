So, to take your two examples, Li Shimin named (unusually) the entire period of his reign the Zhenguan era, and was posthumously known as Emperor Tang Taizong. Zhu Di named the period of his reign the Yongle era, and was posthumously known both as Emperor Ming Taizong and Ming Chengzu. However, Li Shimin was not Emperor Zhenguan, nor was Zhu Di emperor Yongle, because (I seem to keep repeating myself here) Zhenguan and Yongle were the periods of time during which these emperors reigned, not the emperors themselves. Of course, partly out of laziness and partly out of convention you do often find people calling Ming and Qing emperors 'Kangxi' or 'Qianlong' or 'Wanli', but from a strictly pedantic perspective this is somewhat incorrect.
Ah I see. I got confused because of my unfamiliarity with the Ming/Qing and the more typical usage of Temple names I assumed that Yongle was the Temple name of Zhu Di. On Wikipedia for example(which I find isn't very good for Chinese history TBH) the title of the page is "Yongle Emperor" or "Kangxi/Qianlong/Wanli Emperor" for the Qing case but in Li Shimin's case the title of the page is "Emperor Taizong of Tang". Thanks for the clarification.
