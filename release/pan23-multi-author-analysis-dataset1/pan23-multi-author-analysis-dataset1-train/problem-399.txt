Religion and politics were inseparable, but society did not always reflect this mythic interpretation of the world, and there were also more concrete, pragmatic reasons for tax exemptions. First of all, it was useful for the French monarchy to grant aristocrats with privileges because they ensured their obedience. Medieval France was a patchwork of different realms, and as the monarchy spread out from Paris and incorporated new provinces, it often granted their lords and residents with special privileges to secure their adhesion. Usually the king allowed places to preserve their traditional financial and administrative set-up. The system of financial exemptions was the glue that held France together. The nobles obeyed the king, and in turn he respected and protected their traditional rights. Similarly, we should note that these privileges extended beyond aristocrats, and could include the residents of a city, the members of a guild, or the members of a corporate body, such as the candle-makers of Paris, say. For example, the estates of Provence complained to King Louis XV in 1750 that a bevy of new taxes violated the ancient agreements between the province and the monarchy, "under the expressed conditions that the privileges, Liberties, conventions, Laws, Customs, rights, statutes, administration, and the way of life of the province would not be violated or infringed upon." Almost everybody outside the peasantry had at least some sort of special exemption or privilege. Although the traditional justification for not paying taxes was that aristocrats paid the nobler "blood tax" on the battlefield, the days of feudal knighthood were long gone by the 1700s, and many privileges were not feudal at all.
This was an amazing answer. Thank you so much for taking the time to respond! I was worried because the question hadn’t gotten a lot of upvotes, but I thought it was an interesting point and I’m glad you did too.
