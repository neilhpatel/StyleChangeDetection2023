The quote above touches on several key points which we ought to develop further. Firstly, Japan felt that it had earned a place at the Paris Peace Conference, owing not only to its wartime participation (which, as OP has pointed out, was actually rather significant), but also due to its own status as a world power.
Prior to the Paris Peace Conference, Japan had already sought to capitalise on their success in Asia by pursuing a more aggressive stance in China. In particular, they presented the Twenty-One Demands to the Nationalist government under Yuan Shikai in 1915. These demands would, in essence, make China a Japanese "puppet", if not an outright colony. Anti-Japanese protests in China followed suit, and Anglo-American intervention soon forced the Japanese government under Okuma (who, it should be noted, approved of this maneuver whilst also preaching for racial equality) to remove the last group of demands which were the harshest.
Thanks for the answer. Was the West's treatment of Japan really that different from inter-western relations? Intervening to stop another country from gaining too much influence is common to my understanding. The French and the British had come to a pretty big understanding after millennia of fighting to stop the Russians from finishing off the Turks in Crimean War. Many of Prussia's war gains in their unification wars were limited by Bismarck to try and limit international intervention and mostly in German speaking land anyways. The French and the British would again come together to stop the Germans from gaining influence in the Morocco Crises. A-H and Germany would try and limit Italian aims as much as possible in the Italo-Turkish War by attempting mediation.
