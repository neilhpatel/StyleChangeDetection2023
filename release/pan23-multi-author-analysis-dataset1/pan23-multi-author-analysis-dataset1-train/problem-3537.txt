In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Excellent. Do not comply with these motherfuckers. Appeasement never works. Make them issue a subpoena and take it all the way to SCOTUS. Then show up, plead the 5th on every single question.

Exactly. It's red meat for the base. No one wants to see Hunter Bidens dick pics..oh wait, they do. No normal people want to see them. Plus, the guy is a private citizen who's never held office. It borders on harassment and I can't wait to see them defend it in court.
