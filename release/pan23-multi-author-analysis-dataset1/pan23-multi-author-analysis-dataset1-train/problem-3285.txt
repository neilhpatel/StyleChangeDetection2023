It doesn't seem that bad honestly. You can submit a blank ballot if you want. You don't actually have to vote for anything but have to submit a ballot of some kind. You can also just submit a waiver for any reason.
Requirement without enforcement/punishment sets a baseline for larger reforms such as making voting day a state holiday, mandatory funding provided to districts to cover costs involved in voting (staffing and supplies), automatic registration, drop boxes, and universal mail ballots without the forced request process.
This doesn't make sense to me. Why would we want to make people who have zero interest in politics (and likely zero information about the races) vote? If people want to be ignorant, let them be ignorant. It's not important to me that Bob votes in an election he doesn't care about or understand. It will likely lead to more votes for idiots by idiots.
