Feb 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Transportation said on Thursday it is investigating Elon Musk's brain-implant company Neuralink over the potentially illegal movement of hazardous pathogens.
The Department of Transportation probe adds to the scrutiny facing Neuralink, which is developing a brain implant it hopes will help paralyzed people walk again and cure other neurological ailments.
The fuck are you on about? There was an ACCIDENT. How the fuck else do you think we transport dangerous chemicals long distance? We put it on a train. Yes we are worried about it, thats why we have fuck tons of regulations in place regarding the TRANSPORT OF DANGEROUS CHEMICALS. We also care about the transport of infectious diseases. WHICH IS WHAT THIS COMPANY IS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR. I feel like I have to yell at you to get this through what is obviously a serious lack of the ability to think critically. You seem to think that an agency can 1) prevent all ACCIDENTS and 2) cannot do two things at once.
