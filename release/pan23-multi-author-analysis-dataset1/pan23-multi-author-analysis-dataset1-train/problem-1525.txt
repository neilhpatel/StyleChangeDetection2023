They are doing what the donors want. Republicans pretend they care about immigration because they know it’s a good culture war issue to bring out during election season. They don’t genuinely care. Republican donors also like having a giant group of second class citizens that can be exploited by agriculture and big business. I used to work in agriculture. It was run by republicans who employed hundreds of undocumented migrants to work hard manual labor for $7/hr with no benefits.
No. Endless growth is the ideology of the cancer cell, as Edward Abbey famously put it. The US would be a nicer place if the population were to fall back to its levels from the middle of the previous century - around 150 million residents. There would be more land and resources per capita, along with technological automation which makes it easier to access and enjoy those resources. This is also vastly better for the environment than the 'endless growth' model.
