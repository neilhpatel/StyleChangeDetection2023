Everyone is saying it but republicans, the migrants said they were told they were going to a place with jobs, housing, etc that’s why they agreed to the flight until they got put in a island with nothing but the clothes on their backs, they were lured under false pretenses, that’s kidnapping and trafficking (its also funny republicans cheer it on when it’s a republicans bringing more undocumented immigrants deeper into the country but that don’t talk about that or how it cost 12 million in our taxes for 2 plane rides because ya know fiscal responsibility and all that).
