No problem. Something else I'll often point out in the defense of the Capitol Police is that it's actually pretty common in the modern era to let people incriminate themselves on camera and then prosecute later, vs cracking skulls. Safer for all parties!
People underestimate how much of the timeline is somewhat out of the DOJ's hands, too: if some essential witness claims executive privilege to avoid a subpoena, the DOJ has to devote resources to fighting this appeal, often at multiple levels of court, sometimes over the course of 6+ months.
Oh and this is amazing. So Horowitz has this report coming out that basically says that the Russia investigation - despite a few small issues - was perfectly well justified. This really fucks with Durham's narrative, so he tried to talk Horowitz out of it. When that didn't work, Barr and Durham got ahead of it in the media and made some shit up.
