It's a felony in all 50 states because mail is federally run and stealing it is a federal crime. I'm surprised that OP has had his things stolen for a month and not thought to do any of this earlier, but would rather put a camera in their mailbox which the thief would also likely steal. There are so many reasonable actions to take such as filing a report with the postmaster, filing a police report of stolen identity and property (because they attempted to cash checks), putting legal pressure on the complex management to release the tapes or be sued for covering up evidence of a federal felony, or even just standing outside the mail space casually as their mail is delivered so they can see who it is in person, since they're now robbing OP of their livelihood and who knows what else.
I have not read all responses so forgive me if I repeat. First thing is to call the police and get a report done. If there have been checks attempted to be cashed, I assume you know where they were attempted at so try to get footage from them. If not, how did you find out it was attempted? Next call the post master. I also would 100% put a small spy type camera up in ypur box if you can.
