It’s also worth noting that this number almost certainly double-counts (or more) things - system A improperly tracks a $100 transaction, systems B and C improperly track the same transaction, and we end up with $300 improperly tracked. Alternatively, if I buy a $100 item and fail to correctly track both the expense and the new asset, I’ve just created $200 improperly tracked. Finally, if I improperly track the depreciation of a $100 asset over a decade, I may just have created up to $1000 improperly tracked. All of these can be combined to create massive multipliers on single transaction errors - so it's really hard to know what the original value in question is here.
Huh. I didn't know it was accounting misunderstanding. I always thought it was because that toilet seat (or hammer or whatever) was on a submarine/space shuttle/fighter aircraft and had to be specially made to do its job without creating mission failure situations. E.g. you drop the lid of the toilet seat and now the Russian subs know where you are.
