Kate Fullagar argues that this lack of interest in Bennelong wasn't really about Bennelong; he had come to Britain after the American Revolution, after the British had decided there was no longer any question about whether imperialism and colonialism was a good idea; instead the dominant vibe was about how best to do imperialism and colonialism. So 'savage' visitors were no longer the exciting and vivid props to inform those debates about empire as they had previously been. After about a year in the UK, and having visited various cultural institutions (including an exhibition of artefacts brought back from Cook's voyages, including from Australia), Bennelong's younger Eora companion, Yammerawanne, passed away of a long illness.
