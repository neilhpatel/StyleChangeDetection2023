Her having a guest is in the past. If you feel you have adequately complied with California Code Section 1950.5 then ignore her, block her, etc. unless she actually takes you to small claims court. It serves no purpose to continue a dialog with her.
If you performed these repairs or had a contractor perform these repairs I'm sure you have all the invoices and that those invoices specify the location the things repaired who repaired them and most importantly the price of those repairs because that price will be cross-referenced with industry-standard and if it's found that maybe you overpay were you hired a contractor who overcharged you you are going to be responsible for covering the overcharge if it's above industry standard.
Thanks for replying! We feel we've complied and we double checked with our realtor/ a property manager to see if the charges are reasonable. Just wanted to make sure that our "list" and "receipt" are acceptable. She did apparently try to send something to our house that we had to sign to receive (I was at work so missed it). So unsure if that is a suit in the process but thinking not since she's trying to mediate.
