In terms of academic, philosophical and intellectual influence - this is another interesting realm. The influence of the Greek tradition in Islamic philosophy/theology is, in my opinion, too often romanticized by secular academics in the west. There were platonic (mostly in Shi'a Ismailism) and aristotelean (Mu'tazilites, Ibn Rushd) influences found in heterodox muslim philosophical circles, but, again I think the broader philosophical tradition of Sunni Islam, Roman/Greek influences are often exaggerated here in the West.
Thanks for your answer. Would you be able to go at all into this: "That's a great thought. In a way, yes! Although, Europe's Greco-Roman connection is fairly unique and warrants an entirely different conversation."?
TL;DR - The early Arab Empire and later Islamic Civilization didn't really become Romanized because the Arabs would end up completely conquering and absorbing a greater empire - The Persian Empire. Islamic theology, the Arabic language and grammar, government bureaucracy, art and architecture, poetry, music, etc, were all immensely influenced by the Persians. Personally, I think if the Persians hadn't converted to Islam en masse in the 9th and 10th centuries, we wouldn't have Islamic Civilization as we know it today.
