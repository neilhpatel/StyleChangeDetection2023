Yeah, that’s a brilliant idea. Start an official world war by directly attacking a western country when you’re having enough trouble with the one you illegally invaded a year ago. That’ll go over well.
There's actually surprisingly little radiation from modern nuclear weapons as they detonate above targets to maximise impact rather than hitting the ground and spewing comtaminated material into the air.
No. But it can influence the politicians, may mean the UK is slower to offer new kit and support if the Kremlin can put enough pressure on those it has supported (even if that support was indirect and originally taken in good faith, it would be very damaging to the politicians if it was shown the original source was the Kremlin).
So good news! You likely wouldn't die of radiation poisoning. You'd die of dehydration, starvation, or banditry first .
it's complicated. There are scientific papers on both sides but the number of assumptions both sides must use are enormous so it's mostly a case of "we disagree with that assumption" kinda stuff. It's no longer accepted as a truth, but neither is it accepted as not a plausible outcome I think.
