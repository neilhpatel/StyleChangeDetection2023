In his defense, Abbott didn’t tell the police force to stand by with their dicks in their hands and let a bunch of kids get killed. So there’s that. He also didn’t tell the town to cover up the story and try changing the narrative multiple times. That’s on the city.
The problem with this, in addition to the mutilated corpses of children that will now be called “unpreventable” to “nonexistent” by bootlickers and lawyers in the coming months, is that even if they win, the money isn’t coming from those responsible; it’s coming from their own pockets. It’s their taxes that will go to them. And they’ll see the city’s “savings” in decaying infrastructure and slashed budgets in schools and public parks. They’ll also see the Uvalde police “tank” rolling down the street the next time a group of people stand n a corner and say “hey, maybe don’t kill black people?” driven by the people who let their children be massacred.
