That letter never arrived and I had no idea it was coming so I was just continually checking the IRS wheres my refund tool waiting for an update (it just kept saying it was processed but waiting to be mailed and that it would take a while because they were mailing them out in the order they received them).
Call the irs and explain this. If it's been enough time they will do a trace. A trace will cancel any outstanding check and reissue it to the new address. It is their policy. Call late in the day and later in the week. Call volume is very high. You will have to wait.
For future use, trying to pay less in taxes during the year and getting a small refund would make people less tempted (I owed this year, so I added a couple of hundred to my HSA and recalculated until I ended up with a $9 refund), though I hope that the extortion scenario OP describes is hopefully rare.
No. Her and my son are supported by me and live in my house but we are not married and had no kind of family plan or anything in place.
