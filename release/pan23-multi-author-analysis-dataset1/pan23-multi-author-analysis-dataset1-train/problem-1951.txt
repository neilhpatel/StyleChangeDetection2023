As more and more people who were alive during WW2 died, fewer and fewer people said it was the USSR that participated the most, and with Hollywood propaganda and the decades-long cold war, people slowly switched to the US doing the most.
We may hope so. It would be the quickest way for Putin to be defeated with the lowest number of Ukrainian casualties. Just that I don't think Putin will be that stupid.
In reality, the Nazis had beyond shitty tactics and had insufficient high tech weaponry, relying mostly on horses and walking for transport of the majority of troops, and designing hard to repair, overcomplicated machinery whilst taking most people out of factories to fight because they were stupid enough to think they only needed 3 months to win, and thus didn't need supplies or logistics.
Sure, go for that. It'll disable a few and burn the paint off some others, these are vehicles that were designed to handle NBC warfare with the expectation that they'd be facing the 8th Guards Army with tactical nuclear and chemical support in the Fulda Gap. Unless it's caught in the direct blast zone, a Leopard 2 or an Abrams does not give a fuck about nukes popping off nearby as long as it's properly buttoned up.
