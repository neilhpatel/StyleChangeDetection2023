I fall into the category of a supporter of human rights and soccer fan. I am not watching the tournament.
Ok human rights violations get my goat as much as the next technology deserving empathetic valuable human being , but also is it not fucking annoying that you're always hearing record-breaking this and that in relation to stuff that's going ti make you angry?Like why is it record breaking?it just can't be, it's not the climate of the last 10 years.seems to be to generate a reaction more than the truth.
The tournament is brilliantly organised. Stadiums are stunning. Playing conditions are perfect. Pitches are of the highest quality.
So it's just saying that on the day people traditionally went in and beat the shit out of eachother for deals the online sales records are breaking but then it's technically not black Friday it's just the idea of black Friday generating s higher sales volume.online black Friday doesn't count because it's just online shopping.
Negligible difference? If the 2022 game had had the same market share as 2018, it would have had 18 million viewers. How is that a negligible difference?
