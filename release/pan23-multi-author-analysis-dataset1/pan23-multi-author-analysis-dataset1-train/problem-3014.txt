Ok yes i am on very good terms with the company I’ve contacted my old boss all she said was to send her pictures of what I received and that I will have to go to court to tell my side of the story but she said they are sueing the companies insurance and I’m involved in it because I was the driver.
I agree. Since the accident was less than a month ago and there are no facts about bodily injury, I only really addressed the coverage question first. It’s been my experience that company’s don’t settle in excess of policy limits often, and when they do, the retained counsel tells the insured to get a personal attorney ahead of time.
Same thing happened to me. Totally frivolous lawsuit where a cab driver ended up suing me when I drove by his cab at less than 10MPH in a tight parking area with the rear door not closed. It cracked his tail light and that was it. He wanted $10k. The company insurance spoke to me, got my side and told me to not worry about it. Never heard anything again. I was separated from the company.
