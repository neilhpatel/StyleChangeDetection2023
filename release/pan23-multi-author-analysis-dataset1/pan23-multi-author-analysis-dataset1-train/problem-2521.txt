Doris Kearns Goodwin made a big splash with Team of Rivals, trying to peg Lincoln's political genius in part to his foresight in creating, well, the title for his cabinets. Was it that unique though? Looking at early American politics, that first decade or so seems to be as cantankerous a group as one could have, putting Hamilton and Jefferson together! Do you see Lincoln as really that unique and 'changing the mold' of what the cabinet looked like during the Early Republic, or was there a lot of clashing personalities in the early days too?
very interesting! this makes me recall a scene in HBO’s john adams mini series, depicting an incident where, after a lunch with washinon et al., adams is not-so-subtlety asked to leave the room because washinon wished to discuss “cabinet matters” with his advisors (making clear to adams he was not considered to be part of that advisory circle nor privy to its discussions). as adams leaves, he addresses washinon as “mr. president,” and washinon very coldly replies: “that’s right. mister president. and nothing more” before turning back to his cabinet.
Definitely! Washinon appreciated the arguments in his cabinet. He intentionally surrounded himself with people who had different perspectives, experiences, and viewpoints. He wanted to hear all positions and the arguments were a form of stress-testing the different ideas. If the secretaries really disagreed, he would ask for written opinions afterward so that he could consider each perspective in his own time and make a decision.
Hi! Thanks for coming here to answer our questions. Knowing nothing about the first cabinet, I have to ask - was there fierce competition to these positions, once they were created?
