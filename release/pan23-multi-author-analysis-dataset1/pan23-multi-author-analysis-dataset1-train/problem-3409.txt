Second, unlike Evangelical Protestants, the Catholic Church has always been comfortable with interpreting parts of the bible non-literally. Some early Christian theologians such as Origen suggested an allegorical interpretation of creation in Genesis. So when the theory of evolution comes along and conflicts with a literal interpretation of Genesis, many in the Catholic Church did not see this as a direct threat to their theology in the way many protestants do.
To sum up, the Catholic Church has always been open to interpreting creation stories in the bible non-literally, so it was not as threatened by the rise of evolution as were Evangelical Protestants. It also had within its ranks of clergy and religious orders a strong presence of scientists and pro-science types, some of whom worked closely on biological and geological sciences that supported evolution. The literalists within the Church did put up some initial resistance, but as time went on and the science in favour of evolution became stronger, their position became increasingly marginalized. The Church, as usual, took several decades to carefully observe how the situation developed, and by the middle of the 20th century, when Rome finally spoke on the topic, a consensus emerged that evolution at least did not threaten the Church's teachings.
Thanks. It's a funny thing. I grew up in the era of "the moral majority", but the real "moral majority" are those who try to balance the old and the new, and I think that is very healthy.
