Well, this is Simple Questions, and the simple answer would be- they didn't handle it well.. The Articles were drafted primarily to help the United States ( yes, that was the first use of the name) fight to gain independence, and the Articles didn't really create a national government structure to do much more than that. When the war was done, there was only a loose Confederation - somewhat like the European Union- and the Continental Congress was the only national body. It didn't have many powers, and the states were unwilling to grant it much. And, as it had little power, few people of consequence tried to be state representatives to it, and the ones who did try, often didn't attend sessions regularly. It did manage to set rules as to how the new territories could be divided up and made into new states. But as it could not tax, it couldn't pay off the war debt. It appointed a Foreign Secretary, Robert Livingstone, but then couldn't give him the power to do anything and Livingstone ( a very proud man) soon quit. The second one, John Jay, negotiated a treaty with Spain but it then was never signed. He famously summed it up :
There are no radioactive sources in nature that humans can have contact with strong enough to induce acute effects like radiation poisoning (all of the sources that can do so today are products of human interventions, like nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, or radiochemical concentration).
