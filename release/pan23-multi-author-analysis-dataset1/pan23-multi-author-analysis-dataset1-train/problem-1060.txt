The United Nations, international human rights organizations and many legal scholars regard the Gaza Strip to still be under military occupation by Israel.\[5\] This is disputed by Israel and other legal scholars.\[6\] Following the withdrawal, Israel has continued to maintain direct control over Gaza's air and maritime space, and six of Gaza's seven land crossings, it maintains a no-go buffer zone within the territory, and controls the Palestinian population registry, and Gaza remains dependent on Israel for its water, electricity, telecommunications, and other utilities.\[5\]\[7\].
