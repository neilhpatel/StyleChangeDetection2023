Edited to add a reply to the comment below about the spectrum since Reddit won’t let me actually post a reply. Both sides play the game of politics which unfortunately involves lying at some point. One side is predicated on a platform of at least one large fallacy that cuts right to the core of democracy and will eat what used to be it’s own to support it. All despite essentially irrefutable evidence against it. That lies on its own very firmly at one end of the spectrum.
Literally earlier this week I was told in this very subreddit that Republicans mock and encourage political violence but Democrats don’t, or that if they do, it’s somehow different because the attack wasn’t followed through or “broken ribs aren’t that serious.”.
Exactly. Let's leave the misinformation and wild conspiracy theories to the _other_ side. Cold hard facts and the appropriate justice is what's needed.
