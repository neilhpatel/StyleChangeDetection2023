It reported that Sam Bankman-Fried, a twentysomething cryptocurrency billionaire, was making his foray into politics as a Democratic big-money player—and he was starting with a seven-figure campaign to re-elect McBath and defeat Bourdeaux.

Bourdeaux, already considered an underdog in the race, struggled to pick up traction. She lost in a landslide.
