There was probably some groups that had their own chat bots for targeted campaigns but now they’re free public chat bots which means the likelihood that you are talking to a real person is going to go down dramatically over the years.
Uhh… yeah! Exactly. And you want to deny young biological males the choice to have some control over the matter before that happens. I’m the one arguing they should have it.
some of the people who fled europe to go "live free" in the US should have just been sent back to their fate in europe before they could screw up things in the "new world" (which wasn't new, already had people living there, and really didn't have space for tons of whack jobs from a disease ridden shithole continent \[meaning europe. for those who are slow\] to begin with).
If you actually knew more about this subject, rather than just listening to anti-trans propaganda and/or starting with an anti-trans feeling and forcing your conclusions from there… then you could actually present a more convincing argument than the typical vague and blatantly misinformed fear-mongering that hateful right-wing anti types always do. But you haven’t shown me anything different yet.
