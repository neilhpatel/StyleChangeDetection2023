The anti gun campaign is so dumb it’s actually kinda funny. What do you mean where are republicans? They were at home, did you expect them to drop out of the sky like goku or something? Lmaoo, what is this headline bro?
I agree with you something meaningful should be done but I cannot think of an effective solution because clearly Californias hundreds of gun laws only hinder law abiding gun owners and do little to nothing against criminal use of a firearm.
Wait. These are laws created by democrats. What are republicans supposed to speak about, how these laws are stopping gun violence. These violent shooters are targeting areas that are gun free zones. More guns is the solution. A shooter isn’t going to go to an area with a gun if they know people there also have guns. Also when a good person with a gun stops a bad person you are never told about the good person who shot the shooter and saved multiple more lives that would have been lost.
