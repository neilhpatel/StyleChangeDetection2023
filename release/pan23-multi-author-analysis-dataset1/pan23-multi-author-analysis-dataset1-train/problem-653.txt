But I will say: people in many parts of the world at many points in the past certainly believed in "signs and portents," and looked ferverantly for them as omens of things to come, both good and bad. They consulted these omens with the same seriousness and attention that a doctor today might consult an X-ray, or a trader might pour over the graphs in the Wall Street Journal.
Yes, absolutely. The best way to access a collection of these is through Rosemary Horrox (ed.), The Black Death. It's a collection of primary sources in translation. Most of them are from England. I'm not sure how many you want, but.
Right now you've got someone who has never gotten his work peer-reviewed in any way that I can see, who has no real academic training to speak of (his website says he has a BA in Sociology, which is not a relevant degree for a historical work, and not sufficiently advanced to be more than a superficial approach to the subject matter anyway), and who is espousing a totally silly argument. Why should I waste my time on it, exactly? Why should I waste my time on _his book_ and not the millions of other crank books out there? Is there _any_ indication that this work advances real scholarship forward? I see none whatsoever.
Unfortunately, you're making essentially the same historiographical error that Bramley is. You're applying your own presumptions and modern context to the sources.
