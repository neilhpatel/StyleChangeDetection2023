As to your day to day life, we do have a couple of literary sources which do shed some light on the situation. One of the most common types is the Book of Hours. Books of hours were an incredibly popular form of religious text, even for the lay populace, which contained a series of important psalms, prayers and Bible verses. As the name suggests, the Book of Hours also contains a schedule for the hours of the major religious offices, as well as a calendar of major festivals, holidays and Saints' days. In many cases, these calendars were illustrated or annotated with whatever tasks and duties a dutiful labourer should be undertaking in that month: when to plough, sow and harvest, for example, or to say that over winter, farmers should look to weaving baskets, and repairing their houses and roofs.
