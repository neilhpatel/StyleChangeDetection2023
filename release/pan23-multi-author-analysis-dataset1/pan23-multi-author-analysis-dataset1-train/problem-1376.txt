Ooo can I answer the somehow? “We were unable to have investigations into the dealings of the Biden crime family because the democrats were uninterested in doing what was right and working with us to elect a speaker.”.
Absolutely. Especially since part of their new demands are to not approve the debt ceiling. If this happens it will have global economic ramifications. They want to sow chaos in order to exploit it to fill their own pockets.
