> Yet the Panama Tall is no doubt descended from cultivated populations. It must have been brought to the Americas, because the distance from the Philippines to Panama prevents unaided drifting. At the same time, it is clear that the tradition of coconut cultivation was not passed to the natives of Central America, maybe because those who brought it had little contact with them, because they did not stay long enough, or because they reached America in another region, possibly more to the south. It could be the Bay of Car√°quez, as proposed by Baudouin and Lebrun (2009) or the Gulf of Guayaquil, one of the three regions highlighted by Jones et al. (2011) for pre-Columbian contact. The journey from the Philippines to America was not necessarily direct. An intermediate stage in the Polynesian triangle is unlikely because the genetic structure of the populations is different (Gunn et al., 2011) but a more northern route, via the Polynesian outliers (whose coconut populations are yet to be characterized molecularly) can be envisaged. Further research in this area is needed.
doctor Scipione Amati. Since I have not read the report of Tsunenaga I cannot say more about it unfortunately. But this could work well as a standalone question on the sub.
