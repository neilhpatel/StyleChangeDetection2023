Hey so I need to amend everything I had said before. I for some reason thought you said Psudofed(sp) and not benadryl. Completely ignore all the stuff I said before about the smurfing. I think it was just a case of it looking suspicious.
Does not sound like you have any sort of case. That you were parodying other accounts that are also violating the TOS doesn't really mean anything here or bolster your position. A reasonable person would read this as you trying to supply meth producers with precursors.
Based on the above they banned you because your post makes it look like you are selling precursors for making meth. If you are unaware that Pseudoephedrine can be used for making meth the upside of all this is that there is a great show on AMC you can now watch. I understand that you posted this as a joke but they did not take it in that spirit. You can argue that is a dumb reason to ban you but it is not an illegitimate one as people clearly are using the site to sell drugs (posts you parodying originally).
Probably. You'd have to read through their terms and conditions that you agreed to as a condition of having that account.
