I'm not very familiar with the Saskatchewan small claims court system. It's possible you will need a litigation guardian if there is no exemption for minors (for amounts under a certain threshold) like what Ontario has.
In the province of Ontario, it is possible for a minor to sue someone in small claims court (including for copyright related matters) without needing a lawyer or litigation guardian. However, this is only true if the total amount you are suing for does not exceed $500.
If the amount you are suing for is greater than $500 then you will need a litigation guardian. Your parent would typically act as your litigation guardian, but if you don't have a parent that can act as a litigation guardian then it is possible for another adult or lawyer to act as your litigation guardian instead.
Makes sense to me. Itâ€™s very hard to just post a piece of my instrumental, I know a lot of people like to hear the whole thing before buying. And to clarify, there is absolutely no way to sue someone without being in person?
