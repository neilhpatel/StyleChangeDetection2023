That said, I'm really not well versed enough in the government style/structure of those areas to say what is legitimate for them. Returning them to Ukraine for a minimum of five years stability before performing a UN secured third referendum would probably be a reasonable thing to do - but even that assumes that the when they voted for independence was legitimate and not interfered with.
Such utter BS. People just trying to rewrite history to fit war justification. As if Ukraine trying to join NATO isn't in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea. If you don't want your neighbours joining a security pact against you maybe don't invade your neighbours?
Exactly. USA carrier aircraft, at best, have less much less that one-third the range of Chinese anti-ship missiles, they would not even be able to make it back to an attacked/damaged/sunken carrier, not to mention the very fact that the carrier-based aircraft largely carry anti-aircraft missiles, which mostly does nothing in this given scenario.
