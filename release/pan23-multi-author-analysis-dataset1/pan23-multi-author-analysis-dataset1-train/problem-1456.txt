both of those time tested meta heuristics are not wrong - rich people mostly get away with flouting the law and being unrepentant pricks AND nothing comes of their bullshit. Trump is the latest, rancid version of this truth. People are exasperated because they are running to cognative dissonance wrt to the rule of law. We have an overly violent, putative justice system that torments and aggrieves millions each day for almost no reason other than reasons. Yet we have someone like Trump who has very obviously harmed, destroyed, tormented, been an overall darksided sociopath his entire adult life and he's earned nothing but public praise, money and the presidency. His way worked for him, not saying everyone can, but...it's there, people do see it and they are getting shitty about it. It happens all the time. There's a reason why you don't want a breakdown in the rule of law, even in its innocent, bullshit 1-dimensional forms.
