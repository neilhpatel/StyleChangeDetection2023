I don't recall that clusterfuck we'll, but I believe they didn't directly observe anything. They interviewed a group of reporters or something, and everyone in the room disagreed with Amnesty's assessment, and mind you these people had just been on the front lines, but Amnesty ignored everything they said and ran with some bullshit that was largely fabricated, about Ukraine using human shields.
Your brain is so small. I am so sorry. I'll paste and copy what I wrote above. Ukraine did nothing wrong:
You should read more about them and how systemically racist, biased, and uninclusive they are (accusations which they have ”accepted” after a third party investiaion’s finding) and their recent shady payout over an internal suicide and NDA they made the spouse sign (how transparent of them). That’s just one branch over the last 2 years.
anybody who seriously thought that amnesty was somehow pro-russia has brain damage - they do 1 report on conventional military strategy employed by ukraine putting civilians in harms way and then everybody ignores the over 400 reports denouncing russia and claim amnesty is pro-russia.
