I see youve fell into the trap of how these companies name their nodes. Intel's 10nm is in volume production and is basically the equivalent of TSMC 7nm, so not 5 years out. They have it working right now and its used in their latest products. The naming used to reflect the smallest part of the semiconductor, nowadays they're a marketing name. Hence why Intel renamed their 10nm process to Intel 7 so it didn look bad. Intel 4, which is equivalent to TSMC 5nm is slated for next year. Intel is roughly 2 years behind. I'd argue even less than that.
TSMC and Global Foundaries have advanced the art of process nodes to such a degree that it's almost impossible for countries to spend money and will that level of manufacturing performance into existence. The network of suppliers that support TSMC to create their 5 and 7 nm nodes is extensive and none of them would risk selling to China. However, even having all of the raw materials is only a small portion of the puzzle. Intel in the US is one of the most well-financed semiconductor manufacturers...yet despite their prodigious piggy bank, they have had significant problems getting to 10 nm process nodes with acceptable yeilds, nevermind more advanced 7 and 5 nm nodes. Realistically, Intel is 5+ years away from having a real, workable 7 nm process node and by that time TSMC will be at 3 or smaller.
