> In March 2022, The Washinon Post published the findings of two forensic information analysts it had retained to examine 217 gigabytes of data provided to the paper on a hard drive by Republican activist Jack Maxey, who represented that its contents came from the laptop. One of the analysts characterized the data as a "disaster" from a forensics standpoint. The analysts found that people other than Hunter Biden had repeatedly accessed and copied data for nearly three years; they also found evidence that people other than Biden had accessed and written files to the drive, both before and after the New York Post story.[6] In September 2020, someone created six new folders on the drive, including with the names "Biden Burisma," "Big Guy File," "Salacious Pics Package" and "Hunter. Burisma Documents.".
Also as someone that is interested in IT/Cybersecurity/Forensic Analysis of data I've read some credible reports on Hunter Bidens laptop and a few questions have to be answered.
I really don’t know. I just noticed that he flipped one day. It was shocking to me. He did some good work and then boom. I think people suspect some powerful entity had dirt on him but I’m not sure.
