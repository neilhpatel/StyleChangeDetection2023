I think you touched on the reason why. When something happens to the privileged and wealthy, it's newsworthy. When something happens to the underprivileged and poor, people couldn't be bothered.
Interesting. In 1979 I went to England with my older sister on a parent sponsored trip to 'widen our horizons'. We got into a big fight in London (I wanted to drink in the pubs and meet locals, she wanted to spend all day everyday in the British Museum). I just grabbed my stuff and went to Germany. Didn't call my parents for 2 weeks, I knew she would call them and tell them I left so they knew I was traveling somewhere. My Dad was a little mad at me for going so long before calling but otherwise was fine with me traveling around alone at age 18. He wanted us to have new and interesting experiences and taking off alone in Europe certainly qualified. We traveled apart for the rest of the trip and then I met her back in London for the flight home. She enjoyed her trip, I enjoyed mine! We laugh about it today.
