Bush the Lesser cited Biblical prophecy when trying to sell the invasion of Iraq to Chirac. Republicans are not the standard pro-business centre-right liberal party you find elsewhere, they are genuine fanatics.
"What of it?" demanded Hardin. "I realize it was a gross breach of hospitality and a thing no so-called gentleman would do. Also, that if his lordship had caught on, things might have been unpleasant; but he didn't, and I have the record, and that's that. I took that record, had it copied.
Here’s a simple fact for everyone, a Jewish person living anywhere in the world with ZERO connection to the land of Israel has an unrestricted right to immigrate to Israel with full citizenship - while a Palestinian refugee living in a camp across the Israeli border, or literally living within the Israeli border, does not.
Hardin threw himself back in the chair. "You know, that's the most interesting part of the whole business. I'll admit I had thought his Lordship a most consummate donkey when I first met him – but it turned out that he was actually an accomplished diplomat and a most clever man. I took the liberty of recording all his statements.".
My opposition is solely to the declaration of an Israel state in a land where Jews and Arabs had been coexisting peacefully for centuries prior, and the subsequent influx of non-native Jews into the land, consisting an organized settlement and colonization, and necessitating acts of ethnic cleansing on the Israelis side.
Lol, what? Israel doesn’t want to give too many Arabs permanent citizenship because that means Israel’s theocracy, I mean ethnostate, would be in jeopardy. Only 34% of Palestinian’s in East Jerusalem who apply for citizenship are granted it, and it’s usually a very lenhy process. It is highly restricted because of what I mentioned above.
You misunderstand their relationship. Israel (fictional country) does not have anywhere near the political capital to have anyone by the nuts.
