If those write ups are mandated by policy to end in termination (3 write ups and your fired is fairly common), isn't that the employer requiring the individual to obey company orders outside of the work environment though?
A: No. Employees may use any financial institution in the United States that is a member of the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network. Eligible institutions include banks, credit unions, and savings banks. Employees can also designate multiple accounts to deposit their money into.
“1. Payroll. An employer (including a financial institution) may not require its employees to receive their salary by direct deposit to any particular institution. An employer may require direct deposit of salary by electronic means if employees are allowed to choose the institution that will receive the direct deposit. Alternatively, an employer may give employees the choice of having their salary deposited at a particular institution (designated by the employer) or receiving their salary by another means, such as by check or cash.”.
Are you in the US? If so, check out The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA). I believe they can make direct deposit set up mandatory but I do not believe they can dictate where the money goes.
