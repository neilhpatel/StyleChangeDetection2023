After the fall of France, even senior German staff were saying to themselves "Hmm. That shouldn't have worked", but because it did, they thought they'd try again in Russia. Yeah, that was a bad move.
It was also learned that because the Blitzkrieg relies on armored spearheads piercing weakpoints in enemy defensive lines in order to advance, a general "hugging" of the shoulders on each side of the breaking point in the lines also leads to the reduced effectiveness of the breakthough, and leaves the Panzers that broke through open to encirclement if the break caused by the spearhead cannot be fully exploited.
The first real cracks in Germany's mobile warfare tactics were observed in their invasion of France; where during the German breakthrough into French territory caused the German Panzer divisions to outpace their footsoldiers to the point where there were large gaps of open territory between the Panzers and the soldiers and supply corps, leaving the Panzers vulnerable to being surrounded and cut off. During the Battle of France, a halt order was issued for the German panzers to stop advancing in order for the soldiers and supply corps to catch up. The allies picked up on this and showed that if the German panzers advanced too fast, they risk sticking their neck out too far and being surrounded.
