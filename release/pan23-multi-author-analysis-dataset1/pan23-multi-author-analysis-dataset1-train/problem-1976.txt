Athens was a particularly unreceptive place to Christianity - Paul's initial reception in the city was decidedly lukewarm and there don't seem to have been any Christian churches in the city until the fifth century - what worship happened was conducted in private houses, and you can get a general view of the strenh of Greek Christianity from the fact that only three bishops from Greece attended the Council of Nicaea in 325, against 200 from the eastern provinces. Indeed, Athens remained, through its Academy, the centre for philosophical education in the Roman world, attracting scholars and students from around the Mediterranean - and as Alison Frantz notes, it was very rare to find Christians involved in that.2.
Part of the question is that, as Alison Frantz puts it, 'the lines between Pagan and Christian in fourth- and fifth-century Athens were perhaps not always as sharply drawn as might be expected'.4 Herculius, for instance, prefect of Illyricum from 408-412, could be both a major benefactor of the Academy and receive friendly letters from the Christian bishop John Crysostom. Similarly, church officials were often chosen as much for their political connections as for their religious beliefs - take Synesius of Cyrene, for example, who was appointed as bishop of Ptolemais in 410 despite being (and remaining) married, and whose Christian orthodoxy was more than a little suspect - indeed, he wrote in a letter to his brother that he had a few religious doubts:
