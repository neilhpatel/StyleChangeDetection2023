If somebody offers me stupid money for my summer car... way more than it's worth... if I know it's not worth it... I'll give it one last drive and milk the sale for all it's worth. I'll get myself a better one later.
Not only that, the Ukrainian Stronghold of Siversk to the north of Soledar is also majorly threatened because of the broken frontlines; that city will also be surrounded if the Russians capitalise on their victory and push.
Russia’s taking of Soledar has opened up an “opportunity” for it to come from the north and sweep further west to south-west around the city to “attempt” an encirclement.
The capture of Soledar threatens the city of Bakhmut, there is now a risk that Russia could outflank the city and attempt an encirclement.
Soledar is to the north of Bakhmut, Russia controls Soledar. Russia can now attack from the north of Bakhmut.
Bakhmut is now threatened from the north, Russians could even attempt encirclement by moving deeper behind Bakhmut.
If Bakhmut is threatened from 3 directions, is it really beyond possibility that the attacking side could try to or want to attempt encirclement and close the hole?
