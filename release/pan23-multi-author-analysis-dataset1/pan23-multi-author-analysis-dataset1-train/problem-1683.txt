You are asking to answer a question based on a faulty premise. You don’t want us to speak to the authenticity of the work, but rather to hypothesize on possible people who may or may not have existed who’s existence could not be used to demonstrate the authenticity of this document regardless.
Hey there. We understand that having someone come in and assert that you're wrong is very annoying, but please remember our first rule - all users must be courteous to each other at all times. If you think someone is being too aggressive in rebutting your points, please hit the report button on their comments or send a modmail to get one of us to weigh in, rather than snapping. Thank you.
The original question asked if perhaps the Voynich group was written by a hitherto unknown ethnic group, and I agree that this is unlikely, but there remains the possibility that it is written in a writing system invented for a previously unwritten language or dialect, and that the writing system (for whatever reason) did not catch on and was subsequently forgotten.
Hey there. We understand that disagreeing in this sub can lead to heated feelings, but you've got to remember our first rule - that all users must be civil with each other. You started this disagreement with a somewhat combative tone, which we've allowed, but "if you are going to respond a bit more attention to the contents would be appropriate" is completely over the line. Consider this a warning.
Isn’t Occam’s razor that it was a mysterious book that was created to sell in the 17th century, sold to Emperor Rudolph II for a princely sum, that it changed hands in a few times around that period, that it was sent to Kircher because of his reputation for deciphering hieroglyphics (which modern Egyptology has found to be completely incorrect), and then just ended up among Kircher’s correspondence which no one looked at for a long time.
B. Though intriguing, this is just a hypothesis based on a mathematical model and has proven precisely nothing.
