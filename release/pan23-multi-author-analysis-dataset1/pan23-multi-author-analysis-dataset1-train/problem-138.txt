Just the other day there was a thread about late republican Rome, and an answer stood for most of the day which was simply not a very good answer. Frankly I would have been disappointed in the sub if it had been the only answer. Why it stayed so long i don't know, but eventually /u/xenophontheathenian came along with their encyclopedic knowledge of the subject and tore that answer apart. The first answer is now gone and xeno's much better answer is what currently stands as the "answer" to that quesiton. Is it the final word? Remains to be seen. That's how it works.
We moderators volunteer our unpaid time to help run this subreddit because we love history and love sharing it with people, and we have spent an _immense_ amount of time over the past seven years thinking about how to make it a better experience for our readers.
Right! And the mods delete it. That's how it has worked and would (presumably) continue to work. I mean, in the example cited here, wasn't that exactly the case?--a standing answer with upvotes that was nevertheless made better by another poster?
