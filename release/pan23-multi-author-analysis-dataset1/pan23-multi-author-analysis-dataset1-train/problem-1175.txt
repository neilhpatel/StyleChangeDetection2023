Immigration authorities in Argentina are cracking down on Russian women who have started travelling to Buenos Aires to give birth in order to gain Argentinian citizenship for their children since the invasion of Ukraine.
Can't figure it out. The (a kind of intellectual rebel group involved in the establishment of a democratic republic) seemed very much to be saying "we're defined as Argentinians, regardless of where we came from before that". But then Juan B. Alberdi (who was in that group) sponsored that article of the constitution. His mother died in childbirth and his Spanish father (Basque, in fact) died when he was 12 (apparently from disgust at having to sign something to grant extraordinary powers to the dictator-governor at the time). So at a guess, it's because that guy idolized his daddy.
Nowadays it's irrelevant because Argentina hasn't received any significant european inmigration in decades. Inmigrants that come to Argentina are overwhelmingly from other Latin American countries.
Yep. Moldova is in a deep shit with Gagauzia and Transnistria. Tbh I belive Moldovans and Romanians should seriously reconisder unification like east and west Germany.
