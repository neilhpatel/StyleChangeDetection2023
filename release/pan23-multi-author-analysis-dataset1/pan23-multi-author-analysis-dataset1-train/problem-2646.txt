Equity policies make sure kids who have issues like social problems, economic disparities, learning disabilities, minority students, esl students, etc., get accommodations within the schools to help them achieve. An example might be ensuring kids from poorer families have access to school computers and/or internet access to do homework after school as they may not have access at home on their own. Another would be integrating kids with learning disabilities into mainstream classes for part or all of the day to help get them integrated better socially. It also includes having resources for esl kids (a big problem for some Americans) or maybe a non-binary bathroom option for kids exploring gender so they have a safe place to use the toilet or change for gym class (people really freak out about this one 🙄).
Don't worry. This is just a continuation of Desantis' fascist takeover of the entire educational system. No big deal (as long as you're a very conservative, straight, white christian).
