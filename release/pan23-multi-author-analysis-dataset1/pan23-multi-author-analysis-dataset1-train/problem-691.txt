The federal government has one border, and that's to other countries. The state of Texas has borders with Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Mexico (the country in bold). Mexico It's the only border that the state of Texas shares with the federal government. There is no federal border within the United States.
US government control over the Federal border between other countries is supreme over the state in this case. Like, we're talking about military-level, possibly grander global scale situations here, and the federal government is supposed to bend to the state over who's the decision-maker on the border? Fuck no. Anything that has to do with international affairs, which is what immigration is, is federal responsibility. Do illegal immigrants not cross state lines? Imagine there being two states with two different systems of tracking immigrants. Would be a clusterfuck.
