First it might be worth pointing out that the censorship of the female form is not something that is necessarily the norm across human history. We have found plenty of fully nude depictions of women from antiquity for example. One particularly noteworthy artifact is a roughly 4,000 year old vase depicting the , clearly not censoring anything. We also have examples from the Etruscans, such as this from circa 300 B.C. depicting female nudity entirely.
Until a better answer comes along, I can tell you that the ancient romans were big on depilation. They often removed all the hair on their body other than their head.
I'm not aware of any explicit accounts explaining the decision to effectively censor the vulva, however, it is generally believed that within ancient Greek society it was simply considered too immodest or too (subconsciously) sexually aggressive to depict the female genitalia in detail. There is much more information about this in an essay by Larissa Bonfante^1 in which she compares ancient Greek art to that of their neighbors. Another worthwhile read is by Lydia Schriemer. It provides a really thorough and through-provoking discussion about this subject.
