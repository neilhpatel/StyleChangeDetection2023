>What I did in another place last year, sort of. I just left without paying. They sent a letter. I lit up a cigarette with it. So far havenÂ´t received anything else. If they do, I will fight them.
It \could\ say something along the lines of "The total cost for this one year lease is $12,000, with $1,000 due on the first day of every month beginning in August, with the facility closed during XXX time periods", in which case, they might be okay.
No. Let me say that I just lose the two weeks because we have to move out at the end of July every year. It is not that I recover the extra money because I can stay longer. They just disappear.
If, on the other hand, the lease agreement states "The cost of rental on this unit is $1,000 per month, due on the first day, for a total commitment of 12 months" with no further mention of times in which the unit can not be inhabited, then the landlord would likely be in violation of that lease.
Additionally /u/monkeyman80 is right. This just isn't traditional landlord tenant. Whether they outline it clearly as I did in my post above, or whether it's less clear than that, this arrangement is still almost certainly legal.
Those aren't necessarily contradictory terms... It's going to depend on how the language of your lease agreement is structured.....
