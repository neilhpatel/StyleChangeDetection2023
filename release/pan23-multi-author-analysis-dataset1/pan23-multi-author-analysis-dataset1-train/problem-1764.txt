People forget Russia was an Axis power as well... Kinda also gets forgotten since they get this 'faux redemption arc' in history cause they were ultimately betrayed by Germany and ended up fighting alongside the US and the Allied powers before the war ended. Like you're saying it shouldn't be undermined they supported all that landgrabbing/genocidal behavior Hitler was on so long as they weren't the one's getting invaded and benefitted from it.
I'm just gonna take a small coffee break now. I'll just leave the keys in and the handbrake off. Yes I know we're on a small hill that slopes towards you but it should be fine.".
Not to mention that we're spending single-digit percentages of our defense budget to utterly devastate Russia's military (and show how much of a paper tiger it is, too), while putting zero US troops in danger.
Smells like blood in the water. Rocket launchers to Poland. Lots of military equipment heading to Ukraine and Switzerland is talking announcing letting go of neutrality. Putin is weak and losing.
Not sure if I'm recalling correctly, but if I am I think even Italy also switched sides during the war in similar fashion and gets seen as 'one of the good guys' in the history books despite supporting one of the deadliest regimes in history at the start.
