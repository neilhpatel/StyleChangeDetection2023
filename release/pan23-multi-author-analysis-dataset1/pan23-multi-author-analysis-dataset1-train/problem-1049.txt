Regardless, down to your actual question, sadly unless this IS identity theft or fraud in some manner, you don't have any legal recourse. Just attribute it to poor management skills and chalk it up to being unfair, but sadly not illegal for people to do thus to you. In some larger restaurants I used to do the books and payroll for, this was common practice to offer multiple people a single job, and then they would just wait for people to figure out that they weren't going to be working in the end....
I’m in AL. Does the company have a local office or is everything based elsewhere? Can you share the nature of the business? Speaking from personal experience I can confirm that there are individuals and “companies” within the state, claiming to have inter-state affiliations that operate under the guise of successful businesses, as well as offering promising investment opportunities which are in fact predatory and deceptive.
Why don't you just go down there in person again? Obviously calls, texts, and emails aren't working. Go down there and get it squared away. Bring paperwork, all the stuff necessary.
