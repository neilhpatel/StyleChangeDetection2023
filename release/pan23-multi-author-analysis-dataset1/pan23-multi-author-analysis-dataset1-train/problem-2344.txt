I agree it should be extended to anyone at-risk or experiencing homelessness. This sorta sets up a dynamic of "well yah but this group of people is more important than those imminently facing homelessness". Boooo. I do understand and agree with programs to help marginalized populations, but when we're talking about critically needed income assistance to the impoverished in general, I don't think it's the right arena to be creating divides with regard to who deserves it more inside at-risk populations.
Spicy! Oh yeah, idc what he says I’m just tired of Fox bagging on SF. Yeah, it’s dirty, libby lib and has crime but it’s also a wonderful, incredible place to visit. If you stay out of Hunter’s Point, parts of the Haight and Golden Gate Park at night you should be ok. Hell, they’re gentrifying the Tenderloin these days. I should go there more often, I’m only 40-50 minutes away but the parking sucks.
