I see you're getting good advice on both the Canada and UK specific legal subs; one other thing, save everything, the e-mails and the messages. If they're on your friends phone make an extra recording on yours (use video to record him while he holds up his phone and plays the message if you have to just something as backup), do the same with the emails, cloud, usb, even paper print outs. If they attempt to escalate by lying to authorities you'll be able to show their lies and manipulations towards you so far.
Family Members. I don’t have phone service so I haven’t been able to receive calls but I did share my Email and a friend I’m staying with phone number with the government/rcmp and have not heard anything from them. All the have said is the RCMP is paying the cost to fly them out and when I ignored their message I received another saying that the police will be there by Saturday to force me on a plane. I find it hard to believe in general and now especially with all the COVID requirements that are required preflight and cost more. I really don’t see the RCMP doing that but I just didn’t want to run the risk of something happening.
