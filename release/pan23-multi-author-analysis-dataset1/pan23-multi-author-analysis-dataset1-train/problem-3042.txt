As the parent commenter said, it is illegal to give specific visa advice for the UK, so we can't give you anything other than general "this is how the system works" advice.
Edit since I can't reply directly to the comment below: It's not illegal in the UK to talk about VISA rules, it's just illegal to give specific VISA advice. This is mostly done to avoid unscrupulous folk scamming those who wish to migrate to the UK. The UK is a very popular destination for emigration/immigration (depending on your perspective), and there have been problems of companies charging would be migrants for "advice" that is either wrong or freely available. Which is to say, we can give general "This is how the system works, these are the rules" advice, but can't really advise anyone on a specific course of action etc, at least when it comes to VISA specifics.
PS happy pride! This probably isnt something you are celebrating given your situation, but iâ€™ll wave my flag a little harder for you (and everyone else still protecting themselves) until the time comes when you can fly it safely yourself.
