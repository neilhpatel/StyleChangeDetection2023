U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission based on sex (sexual orientation) because this is protected by Federal laws.
Be smart. Text messages and emails are your friend. Try to see if you can get him to do this on one of these formats- then you are golden. Emails are preferred by the court, BUT text messages are where people tend to really let loose. As to there being no protection for you by state law- LOL! Yeah, right. Totally protected. Just check your motives- is he just an idiot who says the wrong thing sometimes? Or is he a bigot who is intentionally harassing you? If it's the former, then lay low. If it's the latter, then he deserves what's coming to him.
Assuming the company has 15 or more employees then federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation (as a subset of discrimination on the basis of sex). This includes hostile work environment claims which would exist if you are constantly called slurs. As the person doing this is a supervisor there is no requirement to report the conduct to a supervisor before filing with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (if it was a co-worker rather than a supervisor you would have to tell your supervisor and give them an opportunity to correct the issue first).
