If you are referring to the division of assets in the divorce case itself, its a VERY bad idea to try and hide marital assets from the court. Find yourself a divorce lawyer, and he or she will tell you what a very bad idea this is.
She has no access to my account whatsoever it’s just that In California they divide debts equally so I might end up paying some of her debt the money I want to put in Mexico is money I’m getting from my father I don’t have this money yet I have already disclosed all of my assets in court she is aware of everything i own but my father has sold some property in Mexico and is giving me half of the money but wants me to open an account in Mexico to keep that money I just want to know if she would be able to take from that since it’s money I’m getting while legally separated from her for almost two years now.

Nope, this is definitely something he should know about before you do anything. Just send him an email stating you father will be giving you quite a large gift. Your plan is to put it in a separate bank account. Ask him if there is anything else you need to do to ensure this is treated as separate property. It will take him two minutes. If he doesn’t want to give you two minutes, find a different lawyer whoo will.
