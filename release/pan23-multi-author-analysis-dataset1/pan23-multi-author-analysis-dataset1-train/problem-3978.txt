Oh, come on now. You named the two biggest companies that are attempting to do exactly what I mentioned Amazon failed to do in monetizing the data they've collected. Facebook and Google in particular no longer NEED to sell data wholesale and be simple data brokers, as they've transitioned their revenue models into advertising algorithms. Now they're the ones BUYING data either directly or gain access to it from everyone else to supplement their existing ability to harvest user data.
I don't know. That's why I am asking, in a somewhat flippant way, because I mostly assume they are just making money.
