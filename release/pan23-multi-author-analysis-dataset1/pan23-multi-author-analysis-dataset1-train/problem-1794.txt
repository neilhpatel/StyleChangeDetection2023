In contrast to the emphasis on consummation that colors modern ideas of medieval marriage (not without some reason), the Church comes down hard on the side of consent. So hard, in fact, that the lawyers find themselves ruling a marriage is determined only by the mutual exchange of consent to marry--independent of any formal sacrament or announcement. They recognize that this has potential to go astray, and try to draw a line between a valid and licit marriage on one hand, and a valid but illicit marriage on the other. (People were supposed to have parental approval, Church blessing, etc). But it does not always go so well in practice.
So, John Bossy in Christianity in the West made an interesting point when discussing the transition from the medieval/pre-modern world to the modern, as he (correctly, I argue) points to the imposition of canonical form as something which while, yes, reinforces marriages as a public good (both for civil and ecclesial society, insofar as the two overlap but are distinct: the two cities of Augustine) and the Gelasian doctrine of the two swords both matter here IMO), it creates other theological and political problems, insofar as it impedes something which is a natural right of all men and women and would be even more so for two baptized persons, for whom the marriage is automatically a sacrament (which is why form questions are now questions of validity, in order to free someone from such a situation if it goes sour), and he notes that Romeo and Juliet went to the friar for help. That was far more likely than any secret marriage, according to Bossy, even though we know that such cases did exist.
