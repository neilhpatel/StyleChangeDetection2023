I don’t understand how Zelenskyy would have to corrupt himself to deal with corruption in his country during wartime.
I don’t see how that means Zelenskyy should ignore corruption during an existential conflict. Now of all times Ukrain cannot afford to squander resources.
Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world, even more so than the Philippines. The fact is largely underreported, because people don’t want to seem as if they aren’t supporting Ukraine, but there have been huge corruption scandals.
We shouldn’t underestimate how much corruption is part of the very culture of government in Ukraine as it is in Russia.
We can’t make excuses for Zelenskyy if we really care about Ukraine. He stood with his country in a time of war, but that doesn’t make it impossible for him to make mistakes or act against his countries best interest.
He had known about the problem for some time, and known how dangerous it is in the context of the war, but hasn’t done too much to root out the corrupt officials. Why?
And it's pretty hard to become a billionaire without at least some shady shit going in, especially in a country where a monthly wage is often maybe a few hundred bucks, and in an area where shady shit, corruption, and Russia are often close bedfellows.
Oh ok yeah, I hadn't heard about that. Yes an independent judiciary, especially a supreme court, is a pretty integral element of a modernized, non corrupt, society.
I hope so. I have absolutely no clue of internal affairs in Ukraine. I wonder if all this is cleaning corruption or moving corruption to people supporting current leadership?
