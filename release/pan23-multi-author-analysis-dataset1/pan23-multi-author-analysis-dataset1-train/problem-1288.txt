Q Yeah. Thanks, Karine. I want to ask you about the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. So, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce embraced President Biden in 2020. And now the president of the U.S. Chamber says that the businesses it represents are fed up with the government making it harder to do business and adding new rules and regulations. Do you have any response?
Regulated Capitalism can promote competition. In its unfettered form it leads to monopolies where the big dogs squash or buy out the competition.

10 seconds of googling provided this overview of Biden's long history of calling various staunch segregationist members of the Senate, some of whom members of the KKK, "heroes" and "deep personal friends", giving glowing eulogies at their funerals, and working closely with them to "get things done", including the infamous "bussing opposition" that we all forgot and stopped caring about once he got the nomination. Those senators also did everything they cld to prevent this very holiday from becoming a federal holiday. I wonder if he mentioned how polite and welcoming they were to him during his sermon.
