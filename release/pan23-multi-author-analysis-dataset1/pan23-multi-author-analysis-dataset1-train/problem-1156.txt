I DID however see that it is illegal for you to be filmed nude without your consent. I don't see how she could argue against you disabling the security camera to 'sit nude on the couch as you often do when she isn't there'. Assert dominance. Say no to pants.
Assuming the camera is just monitoring the living room, which is generally considered a public area (as opposed to areas with an expectation of privacy like your bathroom or your bedroom) having a camera there is probably legal.
So I've done a little digging. It is perfectly legal for her to place and use cameras in the common areas of the home. If you have 'equal rights' in the home, meaning you are both tenants and one of you isn't the landlord, then she doesn't need your consent. There may be legal issues for your roommate if the cameras have audio capability.
Absolutely not. In most states it is illegal to be recorded in your own home without your consent. In public it is generally different (like a business having security cams).
