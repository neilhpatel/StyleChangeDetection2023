We actually don’t have a HOA so we were planning to build a higher fence anyway once we are finished fixing part of the lawn where some of the brick patio is coming up and everyone keeps tripping over it. I am thinking that the police will stop taking these calls eventually, and hopefully sooner than later since my husband has contacted a sergeant at the police department about this. We both basically decided enough was enough when the ridiculous call about us being on vacation came through. I’m just hoping they don’t do something totally insane (since they’re pretty close as it is) like call DYFS and make up a story about my kid being unattended in the yard or something. This actually happened to my brother-in-law and his wife. A very spiteful ex-employee of his called child services on them claiming he witnessed them beating their son in his carseat. Mind you, my nephew has autism and it was the other way around. Obviously, the investigation went nowhere but it was a time-consuming and humiliating experience for them having these social workers in their lives for almost a year over a false allegation.
Let her call. Any reasonable department will get sick of having to waste man power for literally nothing and might slap her with some kind of fine for misuse of their services. $10 they're just as annoyed as you are.
