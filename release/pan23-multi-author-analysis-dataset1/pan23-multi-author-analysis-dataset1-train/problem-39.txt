Without taking up too much of your time, how would you describe the Soviet effort to evacuate civilians writ large? Ineffective, or the best they could do given the circumstances? Have you written on that before?
The only real prioritization went towards industry. The Soviets famously transported entire factories eastward, and by November, 1941, 1,523 such facilities, and their workers, had been moved far away from the front to safety. Otherwise, evacuating was in large part left to ones own initiative. Those in the most western reaches of Soviet territory, if they chose to evacuate at all, would have faced an incredibly haphazard procedure that reflected little to no planning, the Soviets lacking any serious, pre-war plans for such a contingency. Those further east, who had at least a few weeks warning, likely could if they desired to, but not everyone availed themselves of the possibility of course, and available transportation beyond their own feet and farm carts was uneven at best, at least for the first few months of chaos.
