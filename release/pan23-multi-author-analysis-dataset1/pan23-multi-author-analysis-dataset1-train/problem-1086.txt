In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes. Not regulations but labor reduction was a huge contributing factor. Maybe had Pete not supervised the shit contract that they foisted on the workers and listened to labor complaints, this wouldn't have happened.
Basically? It was exactly that those agencies were just overworked and understaffed. When that happens, shit gets missed. It's just that simple just as it is in every other job.

Republicans in congress under Trump gutted tons of regulations - including train regulations. Some of them were gutted via congress while both branches and the presidency were held by Republicans. Others were gutted by the Executive under Trump's Secretary of Transportation (Chao).
Fascinating... This is exactly the conversation and debate I EXPECT from our politicians. Both wanting the right thing, just opposed on the steps to take today versus the ones needed to take to get us to the future goals. That is how political discourse should appear in a functioning society.
