People who believe in completely abolishing the police or prisons either don't care or are naive to the level of criminality that will come from a lack thereof. What happens when the teacher leaves the classroom? Things get loud and rambunctious, there's a couple of kids who keep following the rules, but they don't outweigh the ones who dgaf. Now imagine those kids are older, have multiple guns, and heavily polarizing political views on how their country should operate while being told by their chosen media that violence is coming and is the only logical answer to their problems. And you want to remove the only realistic barrier keeping them from fully acting out? Gtfo. Remove qualified immunity and make these police pay for their mistakes out of their pension. AND demilitarize them.
Well yeah my name is Vlad and I live in Russia and I drink lots of vodka and so on. Very clever of both of you.
I'd like to see our Police Depts budgets cut and use those funds to hire people to perform city services that police have done in the past (unarmed traffic enforcement officers, mental health first responders), but don't require or shouldn't req an armed LEO showing up. Right now MPD is functionally non-existent for many residents due to their ongoing work slowage/stoppage after we wanted to hold them accountable for their actions.
