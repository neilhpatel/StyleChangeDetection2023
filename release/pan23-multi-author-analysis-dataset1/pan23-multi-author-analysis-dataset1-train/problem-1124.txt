Good. And if congress closed down for the next 12 months entirely? It may be the greatest thing to happen to America in the last 75 years. I'm not advocating anarchy, just congress taking a year off.
Exactly. You win with the electorate you have, not the one you wish you did. If all we can get out of WV is Manchin, then at least that's one more Dem for control of the Senate. If people want more progressive candidates then they need to elect them.

So I understand disagreeing with the particular votes of a Senator but I’m always struck by the negative attention directed at Manchin and Sinema from people who lauded the “patriotism” of folks like McCain who did the exact same thing with a key plank of the GOP agenda (repealing Obamacare) or gleefully accept the support of Collins/Murkowski when they kill GOP efforts.
Reading more about it now. I just find the idea of a single legislature difficult in a country built with the idea of strong states rights. This is akin to, sort of, and argumentatively, throwing those out the window.
