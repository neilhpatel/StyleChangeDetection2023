It is valid cuz I think we should rehash that all age requirement laws and they should ALL be centered around brain development not some arbitrary ages like 18 for adulthood cuz thatâ€™s when you state mandated education ends (high school) or the even more arbitrary one of 21 for drinking. Or 24 for renting a car. There are plenty others. My point is that if we are going to have age restricted activities it should be on the development of the brain and then we discuss what is the full development of the brain into adulthood.
The fuck? How you gonna tell a full legal adult what they can or cannot do with their own body? What's next, outlawing ear piercing? It makes as much fucking sense. And again, it's not like anyone does this on a whim. Hell there's lots of psychological work that gets done before the process begins FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PATIENT'S HEALTH BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL.

brain development is actually real. It is a valid reasoning for something like this tbh, it obviously isn't the argument they are making but if there was any argument to be had it should be this one. I'd say all adult vs child arguments should be frame around brain development.
