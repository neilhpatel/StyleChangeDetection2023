NATO could say "well since apparently no one knows where these mystery Russian missiles are coming from, we'll just have to park a few Patriot batteries on the border and shoot down any fucking missiles we can see. To make sure this doesn't happen again.".
>Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau summoned the Russian ambassador and “demanded immediate detailed explanations.”.
I don't think they would. There is a strict rule that no NATO personnel can be involved in the war. This attack is an escalation no doubt but If the Polish troops go in to Ukraine, automatically whole NATO will do it as well. So no point of just Poland involving it's self. Again, we will see what are the evidence and what is being done about this attack. Its not only Poland decision since they invoked article 4 of NATO.
Exactly. Even if they did it it on mistake it would be stupid to admit it publicly and rather resolve the issue behind closed doors in mutual agreement. For ukraine it could prevent to get foreign legion members from Poland. Poland itself would never stop the support buy It's people could. I could totally see myself saying why the fuck do I help my neighbor who just killed my brothers because they fucked up their missile launch.
