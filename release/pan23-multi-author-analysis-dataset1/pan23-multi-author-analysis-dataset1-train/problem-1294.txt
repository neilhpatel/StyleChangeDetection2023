Essentially suing the POA is somewhat akin to suing yourself, in that you the individual property owners are funding the POA's operation. It sounds like that the POA is set up for the benefit of the developer - which is usually the case until the majority of the lots/homes are sold. The larger the property owner group you can assemble, the easier it will be on everyone in terms of carrying the legal bills you are going to be incurring. Also, to a degree, your situation and actions are going to essentially devalue your own properties within the community, as any new potential owner will probably not want to buy into a lawsuit.
Just FYI, it may take them awhile to get back to you. I went through this process in Texas to find a lawyer around this time last year and it took at least a month to receive a response. I’m sure COVID was a contributing factor but we’re clearly still not out of the thick of it yet. Best of luck!
There is a national HOA organization, the Community Association Institute (CAI), and they have a lawyer directory, just google "cai lawyer directory," and you can focus it on Texas through their search function. Anyone there is at least holding themselves out to be an HOA specialist of some sort. Now its true as others said that many are mainly association side (that is where the steady business is), but most lawyers will generally be frank with you and tell you if they can't take your individual case but they know of a good owner side attorney and will give you a referral. Just ask for one.
