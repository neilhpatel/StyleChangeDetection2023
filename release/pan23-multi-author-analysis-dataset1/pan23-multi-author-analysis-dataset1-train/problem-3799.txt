This is what gets me. If sick leave was such a big deal why did they turn it down in favor of more money for so long? Now they want to keep the extra money and get sick leave on top of that.

Absolutely! California teachers union sucks ass. If the whole nation had a solid teachers union, we wouldn’t be here. In California, I am pushing that teachers in the Bay Area and other expensive cities get paid 100k starting. For those of you who say this is tooooo much, I recommend everyone get their sub degree and sub around. See how hard it is when 20 students challenge you. Teaching isn’t for everyone, respect those who do the hard work.
Documents show that when current transportation safety rules were first created, a federal agency sided with industry lobbyists and limited regulations governing the transport of hazardous compounds. The decision effectively exempted many trains hauling dangerous materials — including the one in Ohio — from the “high-hazard” classification and its more stringent safety requirements.
WHAT ABOUT TEACHERS! Why is everyone forgetting about the people who helped basically raise your children, teach them respect, manners, education, all while taking care of 30-40 students.
