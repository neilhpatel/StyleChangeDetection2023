Be that as it may, you can't know the outcome of a national primary with ranked choice voting and fair public financing. I'm not defending the status quo. Tweaking the order of states' primaries won't help in any meaningful way. I was merely commenting on those who have a vested interest in tamping down the chances of progressive candidates in order to protect their interests, which would explain increasing South Carolina's influence.
Calm down buddy. Georgia and Michigan both meet the demographic composition representative of the democratic party AND deliver it in a such a way that is conducive to getting democratic victories statewide.
Huh? Rank-and-file progressives do NOT want to keep the primaries the same. They want the primaries to exclude PAC money, to be on one day, and to use ranked choice voting.

Neoliberalism relies on capitalist realism, Thatcher's proclamation that there is no alternative. Sanders for a brief moment presented one, and so terror gripped the hearts of people financially vested in maintaining the status quo.
