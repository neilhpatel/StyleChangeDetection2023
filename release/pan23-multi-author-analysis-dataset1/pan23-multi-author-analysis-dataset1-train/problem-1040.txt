Imagine the difference implied when we refer to the "Resurrection story" as opposed to the "Resurrections myth." I had a student in one of my folklore classes who belligerently referred to Native American "mythology" even though I had a Native American grad student in the class and I asked her how she felt about it: she said she found it insulting and that since she had living grandparents who were still active believers she took particular offense. The belligerent student nevertheless persisted.
One is obviously the Homeric epics from about the 8th c. BC. They constitute what are typically called "legends", stories about heroes that were more or less told to be believed (maybe not literally, but in broad strokes).
Edit. I just saw that there's an excellent answer on that issue by another user. Anyway, don't mind me.
The way we talk and think about "mythology" today in popular contexts is shaped, on the one hand, by 19th-century nationalist and racialist ideas of culture as expressions of intrinsic characteristics of groups of people, and on the other hand, by the way we _consume_ media today. You've probably heard the bizarre idea of how superhero stories are modern mythology, and while there's probably something to be said about superheroes and American mythology of individualism, what we think of as ancient mythology was, obviously, not some mass media content to be "consumed" and ancient religions were not fan cults.
