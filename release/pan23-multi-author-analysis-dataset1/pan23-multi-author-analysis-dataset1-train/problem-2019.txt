Your apartment is no longer habitable and now you have a security risk. Your apartment can be accessed by anyone that enters neighbors apartment. I hope you have removed your valuables. I could not sleep there. That to me is a pretty big problem. Not having hot water for showers is another big problem. I would lay out to landlord that if he can’t secure your apartment from potential theft and safety of your person (you don’t know your neighbors or their friends) and can’t supply hot water you have no choice but for the landlord to supply a hotel or another apartment temporarily. If landlord says no then I’d take this up the chain through governmental agencies. Move to a reasonably priced hotel with kitchen. Document conversations and dates, take video and pictures, keep all receipts. Have a witness confirm the other bathroom had no running hot water. Demonstrate with video and thermometer for iron clad proof if. All else fails you can seek reimbursement from small claims.
For more info, his apartment also looks like a construction zone, tools/large equipment all over the apartment, plastic liner on the ground everywhere, the toilet and washer is sitting in the middle of the living room and there is a terrible chemical smell coming from the bathroom. These aren't big apartments either. They also ruined multiple bath towels of his by using them to soak up sewage water. He is more concerned about the neighbor than I am. I'm more concerned about it being an unsafe living situation for him. I was in the apartment for an hour last night and started getting a bad headache from the smell.
