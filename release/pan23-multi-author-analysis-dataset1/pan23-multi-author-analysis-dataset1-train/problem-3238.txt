Second... may help you visualise some of what you need. It’s a map used by British command in the 1916 Somme offensive. Can you see how it’s been overlaid with a squiggling mess of interconnected trenches?
Some of these are front line trenches, facing out onto barbed wire and no man’s land. A “support” trench is behind that, for the times when the front trench needs to be reinforced RIGHT NOW. Men could move from the support trench to the front to reinforce particularly vulnerable spots, or else withdraw from the front trench when it was under attack to regroup in the second line and launch the counterattack.
Same person, asked with the wrong account and got banned for the name. Whoops. I appreciate the in depth reply.
Men who had been granted leave would work their way to the rear of the trench net and use the same rail or road connection - not necessarily to go home (they might only have a week or two of leave, which is not much when going home eats up three days travel) but perhaps to go to a town away from the front where they could have a real wash, eat real food, meet a pretty French girl who would love them passionately and deeply for a week and then forget they existed.
