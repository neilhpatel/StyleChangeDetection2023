Going to add that they do run checks over time. Some times the people added used to live at your address and never update their dl. That checks gets run and they will add the other people. I am surprised they did not call you first as that is what mine did when they found someone else at my address. Turned out it was a son of the former owner of the house. It was noted in their system and they moved on and did not add them.
Before escalating to legal action, continue escalating within the company. Base level representatives will continuously try to tell you that insurance rates and charges are based on a set in stone formula that is completely out of their control, but this was obviously erroneous and someone sufficiently high up the chain will be able to help you. It’s an absolute pain in the ass but it’s realistically far easier than higher legal representation. As mentioned previously, Texas as well as other consumer groups have systems to help you if that doesn’t come to fruition, as well as the CFPB coming back into play.
