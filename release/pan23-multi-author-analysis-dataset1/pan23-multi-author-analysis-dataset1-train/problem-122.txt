In the event, this did not materialise substantially for another 99 years, even during the Taiping War. Xinjiang in particular required increasing investment of Han resources over time, as Manchu military forces simply proved insufficient to combat the mixture of foreign invasion (largely from the Khanate of Kokand) and local sectarian violence (from the Afaqiyya Sufi sect) that plagued the Tarim Basin. Chinese colonists, a mixture of merchants and farmers, Han (non-Muslim) and Hui (Muslim), were thus brought into the Tarim Basin's oasis cities (known collectively as Altishahr) as a means of providing (comparatively) loyal military force. Only Mongolia seems to have remained relatively stable under Qing rule.
