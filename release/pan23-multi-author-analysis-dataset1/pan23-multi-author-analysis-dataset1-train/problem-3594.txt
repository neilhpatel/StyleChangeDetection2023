You would need to demonstrate that the EMT’s intentional or negligent disclosure was a substantial factor (proximate cause) in causing those subsequently mental health issues in a manner which distinguishes them from being preexisting. For example, if you had a need for counseling 4 days a week and after the incident you needed 5, plus medication, your damages would be +1 and medication. However, a savvy defense lawyer would argue the increase in your need was not the EMT’s actions but the cause for EMT intervention (why they came due to self harm). That’s why this claim is hard to prove.
"Under New York law, the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress has four elements: (1) breach of a duty owed to the plaintiff, which breach either unreasonably endangered the plaintiff's physical safety or caused the plaintiff to fear for his or her physical safety; (2) extreme and outrageous conduct; (3) a causal connection between the conduct and the injury; and (4) severe emotional distress."
