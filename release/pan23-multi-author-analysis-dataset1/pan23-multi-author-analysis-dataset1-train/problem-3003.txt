I can assure you mobilisation won't be popular, whether there will be bombings or not, it was already proven by crimean bridge bombing that it does not raise patriotic motivation, even despite it being literally the most iconic accomplishment of putin and so called putins electorate's greatest pride. On the contrary, such events raise a lot of toxicity towards status quo in Russia due to unspoken agreement between government and average ivan ("you keep us secure and strong and we dont interfere too much in what you're doing").
You made me laugh out loud. Negotiate? Negotiate what? Russia keeping the territories they stole? Absolutely not.
Christmas eve is the 6th, Christmas the 7th. It’s based on the Gregorian calendar. Typically a big dinner on the 6th with drinking and Ukrainian lore songs which I still haven’t learned so I just hum to em. Presents and all that jazz the following day.
Pathetic. The regime doesn’t even have the guts to do these false flags against their own - but that’s because even the true ‘Russians’ know exactly who is really behind every false flag. These false flags would be playacting for no one - theatrical bloodletting for its own sake, as only Russia can do.
