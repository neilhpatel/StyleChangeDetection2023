Secondly, we have noticed that these questions are often phrased to be about people's individual experience but what they are really about is why a certain event is more prominent in popular narratives of history than others.
So why don't we hear of Xiao Chaogui? During the early years of the Heavenly Kingdom, he was an immensely important figure, as the movement's West King, Lord for Eight Thousand Years (the third-highest in the Taiping hierarchy); and a number of statements citing Jesus as conveyed through his body were made while the Taiping were at their second major headquarters in Yongan in 1851. But during this time, Xiao was wounded in battle during a Qing assault. This was not fatal â€“ as Taiping accounts show, he was killed in battle nine months later outside Changsha, and continued to make statements as the West King. Nevertheless, the voice of Jesus became silenced. Given that he was still alive, it is plausible that Yang Xiuqing, seeking to displace a potential rival, suppressed the weakened (both physically and politically) Xiao to boost his own political prestige. Thanks to this untimely demise, Xiao never got to make an impression on the Taiping quite like Yang, who at one stage was confident enough in his power to inflict corporal punishment on Hong in his God persona, and confer growing titles on his normal mortal shell (including, very nearly, Hong's own rank of 'Lord for Ten Thousand Years'). While Hong still had to reckon with Yang's legacy six years after the latter's assassination (as a last-ditch counter to his growing influence) in 1856, Xiao is largely though not totally absent from most later accounts of the Taiping's origins like the 1862 Taiping Heavenly Chronicle. Except for a few accounts centred on the Taiping's early years, Xiao thus is at most a footnote in the annals of Taipingdom.
