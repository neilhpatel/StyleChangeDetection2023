The reason why unions are so important is in the cases of billions of dollars of capital negotiating as a single unit (corporations), while labor negotiates as individuals. The labor/capital curves end up looking like the supply/demand curves of a monopoly. Unions are one solution to this problem, the other being breaking up giant companies. When mom and pop places hire people, they have to compete with all the other mom and pop places in their industry the same way workers compete against other workers. Imagine if the gardening department and menswear department of Walmart had to compete against each other for retail workers. Both wages would rise.

Absolutely not. Collective bargaining power is the only power that workers have. You're just playing into the hands of corporations to just do whatever they want.
