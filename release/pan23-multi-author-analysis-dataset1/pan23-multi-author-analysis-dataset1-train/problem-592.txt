In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Not really. If the laws, whether they be social, are intentionally being done to limit speech and expression at the expense of minorities, while simultaneously using fear and punitive measures to meet their ends, then that is what I'd call social statism.

If a state is seeing record tax revenues that far exceeds its needs, only to propose more taxes, while simultaneously using taxes and regulations to pick winners and losers, even when those winners, like the Californian rail system are needlessly bureaucratic and expensive, per mile of rail compared to most other first world nations, then I'd define that as a form of economic statism.
No, not at all. 538 does not conduct polls. After 2016, pollsters significantly changed their methodology to account for greater margins with unreliable voters, who were largely responsible for swinging the plate 2016 election to trump.
