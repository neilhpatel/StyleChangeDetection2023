The reports I read all said the ammo was in the basement, which is a recipe for one big secondary explosion directed upwards. The pressure wave would spread in all directions but then stop hard when it got to the exterior and couldn’t move, basically reflecting it all up like an anvil.
It gets better. Supposedly it was a New Year’s party and an entire unit was there. Many of them had not left their cell phones behind as directed so the cluster caught the attention of Ukrainian intelligence. The gathering was less 12 miles from the front line (easy artillery range) and the strike hit at 00:01. The building pancaked almost immediately so very little chance for anyone to escape.
Anybody that is pro-democracy and still trying to deny how politically, morally, strategicly, and logistically logical it is for NATO and more specifically America to continue supporting Ukraine from Russian expansionism and authoritarianism needs to seriously reconsider their source of information and/or train of thought.
4. Spread out your troops and ammo as much as possible to prevent mass cassualties and secondary explosions.
