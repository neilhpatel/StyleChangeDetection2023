There's a large misconception that pre-Columbian peoples had never discovered alcohol, and that's patently untrue, but I think the average person is able to understand this more as we re-examine both the historical record (testimonies that a less principled researcher might have ignored) and the archaeological record with advances in material science. It's not cheap or always prioritized to run material analyses on archaeobotanical material, and when you consider the lifespan of a scientific paper, it could legitimately be decades before relevant findings make their way into more accessible scientific journalism and educational materials.
Native Americans made flour from various things such as acorns , nuts, and corn. We have archaeological evidence going back thousands of years. Maybe the Canadian tribes didn't. Though it would be odd.
The ensuing social consequences of suddenly introducing distilled alcohol on entire societies (read: major) were blamed on the indigenous peoples themselves, and ascribed to them never having encountered it before.
There's also some lingering phrenological pseudoscientific ghosts in the historical dialogue related to this question, which implies First Nations people were genetically inferior to colonizers by being unable to handle alcohol because they had "never discovered it." These stereotypes have persisted over the years in print and media, and especially have become conflated with rampant alcoholism in many modern aboriginal communities- which has much stronger correlations to generational trauma and a centuries-long cycle of structural inequality.
