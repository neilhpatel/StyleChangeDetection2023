Yeah, just by looking at it, it's really clear that it couldn't be anyone else's fault but mine. Their car was parked, and it's clear the scratch came from the tip of an open door. I figured I may as well apologize since it's pretty obvious I'm at fault. I thought the scratch looked kinda bad since it's quite long but I sent it to a few people and they all said it looked like it was mostly just my paint that rubbed off onto their car and it should be able to be buffed out. I'm not entirely sure though.
If you can settle without ins, so much the better, but make sure its a reasonable amount for the damage you did(often people would rather live with the scratch and pocket a hundred bucks or whatever, if they want it fixed right that could get expensive, depends on how bad of a scratch it is). If you dont want to pay out of pocket, or theyre not cool with it, its fine. Thats the time to call your ins, though they will wait until the other person contacts them before theyll do anything. Im pretty sure the apologizing thing is just about admitting it was your fault. For something like this i wouldnt think it matters?
