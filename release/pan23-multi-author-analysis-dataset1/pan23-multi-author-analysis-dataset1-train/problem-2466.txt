The most conspicuous reason is: AFAIK No known Scandinavian (especially Norwegian) ruler had been present at the battle so that no historical writing on the battles in the Britain in the late 9th century was written in medieval Iceland later, so all the possible Norse poems composed for commemorating the battle would have soon been forgotten in oblivion in course of time. Even almost all of the extant 'historical' skaldic poems allegedly composed in the 9th century and dedicated to the Norwegian ruler has been doubted their authenticity by many scholars.
Even though Old Norse poems, especially skaldic ones dedicated to the ruler, were known for its strict metre structure, it has not been easy for them to survive orally without any notable corruption for centuries unless recorded in parchments somewhere in later period. Thus, we owe the transmission virtually all of the extant Old Norse 'historical (skaldic)' poem corpus to quills and parchments of medieval Icelanders (mainly in the 13th and 14th century), either as citations to verify the historical events narrated in the saga prose or as examples of the poetic metres in the handbook for poets.
It is also worth noting that the majority of the extant Old Norse-Icelandic poems were in fact allegedly composed by the Icelandic poets rather than some Norwegian ones. There have probably been more 'forgotten' poets, especially Scandinavian ones, whose work was not cited in later literature, as suggested by the very uneven distribution of Icelandic skaldic poets, divided by individual Scandinavian rulers, composing all the three Nordic kingdoms in . In short, it is likely that the contemporary court had also been open to non-Icelandic Scandinavian poets, but their works were just not cited in medieval Icelandic parchments, so they were lost in course of Middle Ages or even earlier.
Thank you for the great info. Obviously it isnâ€™t the answer I hoped for, but it is a satisfactory answer nonetheless.
