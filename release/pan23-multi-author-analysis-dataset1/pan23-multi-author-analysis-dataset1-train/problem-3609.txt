It obviously would've led to confusion for Classical Latin speakers though, who apparently often mistakenly pronounced it like it was spelled.
In Classical Latin, CAESAR would've been pronounced /kaesar/, pretty much exactly how it reads, but as time went on, Latin, like all languages changed and eventually evolved into the Romance languages.
edit: as to answer your question as to when this happened, the original Old English direct from Latin was cƒÅsere, pronounced /ka:zere/, but it also competed with Norse derived versions and now, it's more similar to an Old French loanword which has gone through the vowel changes that characterize Modern English.
However, /e:/ in Modern English became /i:/, you can compare the pronunciation of the Old French loanword feast /fi:st/ to the more modern Latin loanword festival, which more or less reflects a more traditional sound as it was borrowed after the shift.
What a great answer! I'm always interested in etymology and phonetics (and how sounds change over time).
