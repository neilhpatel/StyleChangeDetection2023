You went quickly over it but then, was there an advantage to enlist over being drafted? Did it actually give you more control on what you wished to do? Or it was wishful thinking?
The actual history is considerably more complicated. Not all men who were drafted or volunteer were actually sent to South Vietnam. Not all volunteers explicitly volunteered to go to South Vietnam. While the majority of the fighting in the early years of the war were fought by volunteers, this would decline over time and draftees would take a considerably higher involvement in the fighting towards the end of the war.
In conclusion, while there was no surge in voluntary enlistment based on patriotism or a perceived danger as in the aftermath of 9/11, the context of the draft and the Vietnam War did cause a surge in voluntary enlistment.
Something that is often brought up as a misconception about the Vietnam War is the idea that the majority of American soldiers were drafted rather than volunteers. This is often pointed out as being wrong, that there were more men who volunteered than were drafted. On paper, this is true. While 2.2 million men were drafted between 1964 and 1973, a total of 8.7 million men enlisted. However, numbers alone can't tell the whole story.
