uh, why not spend that 20 billion to wean themselves off coal first? and oil? Cause those politicians lose money if their country no longer give billions to big oil and coal companies? While Indonesia is gonna use the loan to buy their technology anyway to move away from coal? So the only one losing money is indonesian coal companies, while freeing supplies and lowering price for the companies importing indonesian coal. Very smart plan as always.

Shame that this news isn't more engaged. This is really good news, especially to the doom and gloomers who claim that nothing is being done about climate change. Getting 270 million people onto clean energy is huge progress.
