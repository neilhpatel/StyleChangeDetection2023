Only the first block of the book is in Latin, from page 89 of the viewer onwards it is in Spanish, but I still doubt it would be of help.
The only edition I know is the one made by the University of Salamanca, and it is in Spanish. The title is "Diario de un estudiante de Salamanca". Sorry.
Do you potentially have any resources that explain how the Spanish language has changed, particularly orthographically. I see stuff like "Henero and Hebrero" for January and February presumably as well as the cedilla in March; why was stuff like the cedilla dropped and were January and February both pronounced with the same starting sound back then and later split to what we have today, or was it just an imperfect orthographical representation? Also, what's with the odd "s" symbol?
About the affordability, it very much depended, but looking at title XLIII, it does not look all that expensive, however some students received scholarships from the colleges, or were sponsored by the Church, or poor students could earn something serving as pages or richer students, even earning some money as "benchwarmers". The cost per subject, according to title XLIII, was as follows, and I quote: That the generous instituted in dignity shall pay half a real, and the bachelors inscribed in any school 7 maravedis, except the sons of doctors and masters, who shall be inscribed for free, and the grammarians shall pay 3 maravedis.
I just realised looking at this that I've never seen old Spanish lol... It's so interesting to look at because it's so familiar yet different.
