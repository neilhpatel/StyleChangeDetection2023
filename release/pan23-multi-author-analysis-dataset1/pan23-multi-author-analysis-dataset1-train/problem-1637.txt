The defendant has to willingly pay you. There’s no getting blood from a stone. You can get a judgement and extend it relatively easy. But it’s just a piece of paper that’s meaningless.
This is going to be a wild toss in the dark, so definitely bring this idea to a lawyer's attention, but given that you weren't in full control of the vehicle at the time of the crash, and that police records confirm that the perpetrator was considered in control at some point during the act of the crime, I would argue that you should be covered by insurance under the uninsured/underinsured motorist clauses of your insurance policy. Of course your insurance isn't going to see it that way because they don't want to pay out, but it's a potential avenue of legal argument that could possibly stand. Again, review that idea with a qualified lawyer as I'm just an amateur/armchair law enthusiast, but if you did not have control of the vehicle and another passenger did, that passenger should be considered the driver for the brief time they had control of the vehicle. Thus, as they were another driver in the course of the accident, you should be covered by that part of your policy.
