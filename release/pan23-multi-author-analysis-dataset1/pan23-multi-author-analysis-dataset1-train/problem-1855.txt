That's an individual case that no one can comment on without knowing the details, and it's likely that no one here, including you, have all the facts needed to do so. Individual cases going one way or another do not on their own indicate bias. There are too many factors in each individual case for anyone to know why the judge ruled the way they did or what the factors in that judge's decision were. If you would like to continue this discussion by citing your own unbiased scholarly sources, please feel free. But someone else's custody case that you only learned about second hand through a narrator who may or may not be telling the truth (people will lie through their teeth to friends and family when they lose custody because they often don't want to admit why the judge did not think they would be a good primary parent) is an absolutely terrible metric to use to evaluate how the courts are likely to act in the future.
