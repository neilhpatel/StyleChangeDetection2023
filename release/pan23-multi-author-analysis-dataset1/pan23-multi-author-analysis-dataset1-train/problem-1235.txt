When people in the GOP are actively suggesting people like me should be shot for being who I am, by not denouncing this rhetoric they are supporting it. Considering nobody from the GOP has denounced such talk, then they donâ€™t get any compassion from me. Like I said to other comments, I do not wish them dead, I do not want them to be harmed but I refuse to feel bad for them leaving this earth because I tried for many years to have compassion but only so many times I can receive death threats and still feel bad when they are gone. If I had been there when they were shot, I would have done everything in my power to save their lives because I will not give up on the living. But at the end of the day I will never feel sorry for the loss of someone who would support my death.
American politics aren't divided down liberal and conservative lines anymore, it's divided by reality and fiction, it's divided between creating solutions and creating problems.
Great! Vote democratic but don't you dare run as democratic. We've had enough of people like sienma who say they are D but are totally R in sheep's clothing.
