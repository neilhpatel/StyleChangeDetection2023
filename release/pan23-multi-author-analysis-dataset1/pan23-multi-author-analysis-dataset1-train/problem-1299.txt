At the time of Lincoln's election, there were eight living Supreme Court justices. One, Peter Vivian Daniel, a Democrat from Virginia, had died on May 31, 1860, during that year's Presidential campaign. President James Buchanan did not nominate a replacement before Election Day. His party was deeply divided as it was, with a Democratic National Convention less than a month before Daniel's death failing to nominate a presidential candidate. This resulted in a second convention already scheduled just a couple of weeks after Daniel died. And ultimately, that convention also failed, the Democrats could not unify, and they nominated two different presidential candidates at competing conventions.
So pretty clear where this is going right? He's impeached and in 1862 the Senate finds him guilty, bans him from serving in a federal appointment forever, and vacates the seat. You can read the Senate minutes.
So, there was a situation where the United States was populated by a large, and increasing, majority of anti-slavery people, but with a court which was deciding cases on a narrow view that slavery trumps all, and that the legality of slavery was more important than the popular will. This created severe tension between legality vs. legitimacy, since the United States is founded on a basic principle of "consent of the governed". As Michael P. Zuckert writes in "Legality and Legitimacy in Dred Scott: The Crisis of the Incomplete Constitution", published in the Chicago-Kent Law Review:
