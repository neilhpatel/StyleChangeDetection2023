Edit: I appreciate the irony of posting about the Admins doing something shitty, and then getting gilded for it, but I have plenty of creddits as it is, so please consider donating a like amount to a favorite charity instead. Thanks!
I fundamentally disagree with the addition of the chatrooms into this subreddit this flgrently violates the fundimintal putpoise of this subreddit which is to provide researched, comprehensive and historical answwers for the benifit of the community chatrooms makes this as worse as a social media site.
Yes. It's not just that this sub will have an unmoderated space, it's that this sub already draws in unsavory types looking to horn in on history. The advent of this chatroom will given them a ready-made space to deny and twist history. It's not like giving subs like /r/pics or /r/askreddit a chatroom.
Excellent decision. I stopped contributing on a regular basis because I disagree with Reddit's editorial policies, but I still appreciate the hard work that's necessary to keep things running here.
We can't. As noted, Mods have no control over these spaces, which is part of the issue. It is separate from the dedicated chat rooms created by mods for their communities which they can moderate. The Admins were clear in their own responses that Mods don't mod these. The Admins in theory mod them, but what that means is practice, who knows...
