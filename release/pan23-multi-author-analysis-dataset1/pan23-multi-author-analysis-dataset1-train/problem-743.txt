In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yeah I think so. It’s shocking to me how the Democratic Party has failed so incredibly on messaging. the republican party has so successfully distorted democratic values to the majority of voters. Republicans now flaunt the rule of law and try to attack the United States capital and all Democrats do is have impotent public hearings and focus on identity politics. What a fucking shame.
Gerrymandering maybe? Suppression of voting, banning mail in voting, changing the rules, installing nutters who are conspiracy cults, intimidation of ballet boxes, invalidating your ballot because you forget to date it, umm there’s so much more but im tired of thinking about it.
Nope. That's fine. I'm sure we'll do it when we get into power, too. But you can't simultaneously argue that college admissions are kind of bullshit and award people for being rich, being legacies, SAT's are racially bias, etc. Then turn around and say (and this is something I've heard liberals say) "colleges are so left wing because the smart people are all liberals.".
