The State of New Jersey does not have a law governing rent increases. However, municipalities within the State may adopt ordinances regulating the amount and frequency of rent increases within their specific municipality.
Your actually monthly ret was 1950... But since you those free months you effective net rent was 1650.. very different things. They only raised your real rent 10 percent... In NJ it's allowed.
Considering your municipality allows rent increase of 9%/year for affordable housing (low, very low and moderate income housing developments) it is likely that they would not consider this increase unreasonable. Doesn't mean it is something you can afford, only you can determine this. As another commenter mentioned, responding that this increase will likely be unaffordable for you could potentially bring about a change, however, I would not much expect it to. Most areas have a shortage of housing and rental units can go really quickly, which is how landlords feel confident raising the rent will not hinder their ability to rent the unit- whether or not it is to the current tenant....
