This list of theorists does include a number of very familiar names, though: Dante imagined three distinct families of languages in Europe, "Northern"/Germanic, "Southern"/Romance, and "Eastern"/Greek+Slavic; while Leibniz figured there were two families in the region, "Northern" and "Southern" (Slavic languages were shortchanged once again), and noticed that Hebrew was related to Arabic, but not European languages like Latin and Greek. Between the two of them, Joseph Justus Scaliger, a French Calvinist from the second half of the 16th century, rejected a claim from before his time that Hebrew was the 'original' language from which all others spawned, and grouped European languages into four families based on the word for 'God' (Deus, Theos, Godt, Boge).
Thanks for replying! I'm also curious about that insight into Hebrew's origin. It must have been a shock for linguists to conclude that a sacred language like Hebrew can't have a divine and unchanging nature. I've always understood that one of the big social implications of Darwinism is the conclusion that the human species is not eternal and unchanging.
