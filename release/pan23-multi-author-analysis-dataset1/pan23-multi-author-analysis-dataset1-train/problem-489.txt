By time the 2024 Presidential election rolls around we are on target to have avoided a major recession and inflation will have returned to normal levels as all of the world economic machinations return to normal levels following the effects of a world wide pandemic.
Jokes on y’all. I’m on the roof of those offices. I don’t gotta deal with y’all liberals. I’m being paid 100/hr to stand there. I’m a leftist, you liberals embarrass the shit out of me. Continue to sit in your cubicles like the slaves you are, meanwhile smoking mad cigs on roof. Freeedom.
