Yeah, it’s unfortunate that the pharmacy didn’t respond to you. I know many have been severely understaffed and overwhelmed during the pandemic, but it’s in your hands to ensure you get your medications in a timely manner. I would recommend speaking with the pharmacy about the issue, getting a new prescription and putting it on autofill so that you get it on time in the future. Best of luck.
Prescriptions generally expire after one year. California doesn’t define any time limit (except for controlled substances), but pharmacists can still decide that a prescription more than a year out shouldn’t be filled as professional discretion (that you should visit your primary physician to ensure the medication and dosage is correct).
I would call corporate. I had a Wallgreens pharmacist only give me half my prescription for a controlled substance. After this happened 3 times and I kept having to count them in the parking lot and go back in to get my other half. I told them if it happens again I will call corporate and it never happened again. Something shady might be going on so I would call corporate.
