Yeah, about that period we see quite a lot of people criticising the practice of leaving women in complete ignorance of sex, which had apparently been common recently, or still was almost into the 1920s. So in 'Married Love' (1918) Marie Stopes several cases like that, including one matching that described from the show, where an educated eighteen year old girl is seriously worried about pregnancy after being kissed once.
Yes. As I mentioned in the quote-in-a-quote about Regency scandals, societal attitudes toward this kind of thing were shifting over the early nineteenth century - Effie Gray Ruskin, who first married in 1848, said that she "had never been told the duties of married persons to each other and knew little or nothing about their relations in the closest union on earth." Married couples displayed less and less open affection, leading to their children having less of an idea about marital relationships, and premarital sexual exploration (as Hera Cook puts it in The Long Sexual Revolution: English Women, Sex, and Contraception 1800-1975) became strictly curtailed.
Follow up: Was there no backslash/resistance against that shift? I guess that there would be quite a large non-conformist movement stressing sex-positivity if today's social mainstream began to push for more Victorian, puritan ethics.
