At the same time the Russian state was built on models taken from outside, from Mongol statecraft to the writings of a German living in London (not to mention revolutionary intellectuals living in Switzerland). Russian food, literature, art, commercial practices, language etc. etc. are all dialogic, they aren't monolithic (and this is pointed to by funkejames in the first reply re: dance etc.).
In addition to the (incredibly lightly) mentioned military force, population movement, and settling of ethnic Russians, far from being woke, Russia found its unity in its diversity.
The thing that made Russia stay together, aside from brutal militaristic force, was its ability to adapt foreign peoples and cultures into their own and to convince these peoples they were better off as Russians. A man in Kamchatka will likely have more in common with a man from Nunavut than he will with a man in Moscow. In everything from language to the clothes they wear, but what makes him culturally united and connected to the man in Moscow is the fact that he says he is Russian.
Sure the majority of people within what was the Russian Empire and modern day Russia can speak Russian, a lot of the time, that is as far as Russian culture may go. Vladivostok would be the best example of this; it being a fairly metropolitan and European appearing city, but you go some kilometres north and you have people living in yurts and wearing furs.
