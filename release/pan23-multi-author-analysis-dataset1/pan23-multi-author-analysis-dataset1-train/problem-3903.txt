Idiot racists and people who target Asian street gangs. Normal, law abiding people get caught in the middle. We have the same racism problems as the rest of the world, but far more firearms than most. Pretty tragic combination.
Huh!? You're like 100% blatantly wrong. Like, wow. Did you even read the study at the link you sent?
Which means white men are demographically underrepresented. Add to that the fact that LA is less white than most of the country and the fact that white people tend not to be the majority demographic for anti-Asian violence. Who knows.
I've also spent significant time in Nashville (work trips), Houston (father in-law lives here), Birch Bay & Bellingham, WA (my grandparents used to live there), and several trips to NYC (mostly leisure), add to that my having lived & worked in CA, I've experienced the most populous pockets of the USA. I've witnessed first hand rampant society-ingrained racism. I've never felt fear the way I felt fear when a state trooper pulled me over in Texas. Frightening shit. Gun out and an attitude that screamed: give me just one reason to abuse you and I will.
White men are actually demographically underrepresented in mass shootings. Plus the fact that this was anti-Asian and in LA leads me to believe it’s unlikely this was a white christian.
Basing my experience? I think you mean basing my opinion...which is true, one bases their opinion on their experiences.
Again, you don’t understand what demographically underrepresented means. Google it, ask someone, or remain ignorant. I have a good idea of what you’ll choose.
