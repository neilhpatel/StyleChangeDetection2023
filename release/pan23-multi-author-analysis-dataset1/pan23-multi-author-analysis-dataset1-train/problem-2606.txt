From Cyrus, we have the Cyrus Cylinder, which does not invoke Ahuramazda, but it does focus heavily on the local Babylonian deities. The absence of Persian religious elements is usually accepted as part of the Cylinder's appeal to the conquered Babylonians, rather than anything specific about Cyrus himself. The only other three inscriptions that are supposed to be issued by Cyrus are at Pasargadae. All three of those just lable the site with the phrase "Cyrus, the Great King, and Achaemenid.".
In either case, at the very least by the Hellenistic age, Auramazda was identified with Marduk/Bel, who was also identified with Zeus judging by numismatic and other evidence from Central Asia and Northern India, where syncretisms of Zoroastrianism, Hellenic and Near Eastern religion, and early Vajrayana Buddhism flourished. Another example of such syncretism is Apollo-Mithra-Shamash/Utu, the Seleukid interpretation of the mesopotamian sun-god of law and kingship, and his closest Hellenic and Iranian equivalents.
