Funny you say that. When I first read the news, I turned to my coworker and asked "why is it always Poland?".
The powered range of an S300 is 400 km, and Przewodow (where the missile landed) is about 150 km from Belarus (from which Russia is launching many of its missile attacks on Ukraine), so it's well within the range that you will find if you naively google "s300 missile range".
But when used as a shitty ballistic missile, as russia is doing, the range is much greater because the missile can make most of its flight unpowered (hence the "ballistic" part).
Since it appears that the missiles were s300 AA missiles that had been repurposed into ghetto ballistic missiles, poor equipment/targeting seems very plausible.
agreed.. If Ukraine has Iron Dome technology not only does it protect Ukraine, it protects a massive amount of air-space between Russia and a dozen NATO countries.
