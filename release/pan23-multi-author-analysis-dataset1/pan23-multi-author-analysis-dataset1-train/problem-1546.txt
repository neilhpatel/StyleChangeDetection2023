Yes, your employer can require you to use other forms of PTO before sick leave, as long as their overall paid leave program meets the requirements of California's sick leave law.
California does not require employers to offer separate sick leave and vacation time if their PTO plan meets the minimum requirements of the sick leave law. If the employer offers sufficient combined PTO and sick leave to meet the legal minimums, and the PTO pay otherwise meets the requirements of the sick leave law, the employer is meeting their legal obligations.
