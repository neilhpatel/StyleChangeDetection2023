Believe me, I know how stupid it is. I’m personally in a better position with regards to health care in that my employer provides what passes in the US for good health care benefits, but whenever I see a conservative posting a go fund me campaign in order to pay for necessary health care, r want to bang my head against the wall. I think part of the problem is the size and relative isolation of the US. Only fairly well off Americans can afford to visit other countries and our media is completely American centric, this means it’s much easier for corporate media to spread lies about how much worse it is in countries with universal healthcare. I have had numerous conversations with people who actually believe we have the best healthcare system in the world, and countries with universal health care results in your government trying to kill you in order to save money. It’s absurd but I haven’t been able to convince them otherwise.
