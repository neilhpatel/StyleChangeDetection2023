In large parts of Africa Facebook is literally the only Internet access they have. They've made a special version of the app that users can access even if they have no mobile data credit. Something like 90% of Africans access their Internet through a mobile device and do not own a computer or Wi-Fi so all the news, entertainment and search results are delivered directly via Meta.
Right. In any event this lawsuit will go nowhere. If it’s filed in a foreign country Facebook can just leave and if it’s the USA they’re protected by section 230. They’ve been sued before and have never lost over these types of claims.
Completely frivolous. From every possible angle. There is no liability here by any stretch of the imagination, and the claimant is certainly not empowered to pursue such damages on behalf of others. But I guess the sentiment is nice.
Yeah at least historically a significant majority of their content moderation was exclusively for English language content, the problem is way worse outside of predominantly English speaking countries.
