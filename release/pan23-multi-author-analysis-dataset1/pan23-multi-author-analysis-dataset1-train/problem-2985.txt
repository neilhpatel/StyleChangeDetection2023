A kid hugging his young siblings too tightly is aggressive and undesireable, but calling that "dangerous sexual activity" is quite a leap. You are obviously not thrilled with having to deal with this stepchild and he clearly feels that. It's hardly surprising (or unusual) for him to react by behaving aggressively to the younger siblings who he feels are favored and competing for his dad's affection. You can either try to portray him as a predator, which will further push him away and probably aggravate any problem behavior or you can do the hard work to make your family a welcoming, supportive place for him, do family therapy, help him feel just as loved as the siblings and it's likely this hugging will cease to be an issue.
You’re out of line. And that’s great for you I’m not worried about downvotes didn’t come here for karma. I came here for help which you’re clearly having a bad day, and I hope it gets better for you. You don’t need to harass me though and like her abuse I refuse to take yours as well. Good day sir.
I served as a Court Appointed Special Advocate for foster children for many years and am fairly attuned to "There's more to this story" type stories... and if you're currently having only supervised visits and calling hugging "dangerous sexual activity", that's a pretty good indicator there is waaaaay more to this story and CPS, the courts and your attorney will see that as well.
Thank you. I greatly appreciate it. We tried to work it out obviously with her without the courts but sadly this is the route she took which is leaving a wake of turmoil in the path.
