Also I love how anyone that is any type of conservative is automatically a racist or the like on here. Fiscal conservative is a thing. Do I want the government controlling everything hell no do I want them dolling out money to make people dependent and lazy god no. But that’s what people will vote for. Who will give me the most stuff. Welfare is the most racist thing out there. It was geared to make poor( at the time black) families dependent on the government to survive. Also the democrat party is finally being shown as it’s racists roots. Look at Biden super racist his whole life even says this and still people will blindly support him.

Definitely hope Fetterman wins. They're trying to use the stroke against him, much like they tried to use Bernie's "mild" heart attack against him in the early stages of the 2020 campaign. Ironically, Bernie had MORE energy after that, and he's still going at it, out there campaigning for others this time around. Fetterman's a few decades younger than Bernie, so I definitely expect similar results from him.
