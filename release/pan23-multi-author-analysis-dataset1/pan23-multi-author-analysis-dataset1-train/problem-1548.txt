Which means what exactly? When is that? Because the NI Secretary REFUSES to say what the exact conditions that would trigger a border poll are. We have a majority from a catholic background now. We have a nationalist/republican first minister. We have NI in a position where the reasons to stay in the UK (HSC, EU, etc) are crumbling. When do we get our border poll?
Furthermore, the UK can block the publication of anything related to the Royal family, wrongdoings by the military, crimes committed by the security services, ...
That’s exactly what the point of this bill is though. It’s the British government trying to start up discontent in NI to say they have the right to unilaterally undo the NI protocol if they feel negotiations aren’t heading their way.
That's true. I'd say that restricting freedom of speech / freedom of press to preserve human rights is totally fine though.
Freedom of speech may "therefore be subject to certain restrictions for respect of the rights or reputation of others".
