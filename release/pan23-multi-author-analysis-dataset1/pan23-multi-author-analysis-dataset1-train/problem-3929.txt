1.The Origin and Significance of "The Land Flowing with Milk and Honey", Philip D. Stern, Vetus Testamentum Vol. 42, Fasc. 4 (Oct., 1992).
>What all current models used to explain the phenomenon of early Israel have in common is that they focus on indigenous origins somewhere within Greater Canaan, and they portray an ethnic group that somehow embraces many elements of the local population. The remaining debate among specialists largely concerns the percentages of such groups as local refugees, displaced subsistence farmers, various dissidents and dropouts, former pastoral nomads, and perhaps even a small exodus group, whether or not they had actually even been in Egypt. The old conquest model is gone forever.
Principally, milk and honey should not be thought about as chiefly nutritious or primarily for gastronomical liking, but through a broader typological and vegetational relation to the promised land as geographically and culturally existent, which is flowing with milk and honey, contrasted to otherwise barren areas and Egyptian lands.
