To be honest most ‘public’ things are privatized because they are inefficient and government knows if companies start acting bad they can force them to do anything they want or just take over the company.
Nah. Targets for privatisation are always profitable, and rarely as inefficient as they are made out to be. Private industry has no interest in paying big bucks for a business they can’t make a good profit from. Privatisation is more about ideology and $. I have yet to see an organisation become more efficient post-privatisation. And Government re-taking control if they start acting bad? Still waiting on that one.
They were warned by opponents at the time that private ownership would like to price hikes and that the institutional investors would take over and get their money back many times over, but people had instead performed the calculation that a £300 short, equally a Spanish holiday in 1989 ditto British Gas, and the electricity producers too.
Would it? There are creative way to do this. Institute a tax on the producers that is narrowly tailored to hurt their profits, require costly government verification, etc.
