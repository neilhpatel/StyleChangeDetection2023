Following World War I, the United States was generally disinterested in all things military except, to an extent, the Navy, which remained comparatively powerful. Service in the Regular Army in time of peace was not seen the same way as it is today, and the Army suffered, as the funds allocated to it by Congress would not allow it to pay its soldiers well compared to what a civilian would make, maintain the nine active stateside infantry divisions it originally intended, or invest on a systematic scale in modern weapons and equipment.
Was that pay rate really viable, though? A young soldier in the Army pre-WWII was making $250-400 a year according to your numbers (assuming they would be in the E1-E3 range). Was that a livable wage during the early years of the great depression? Also, this would be even less for the National Guard since they were paid only during the two week period and monthly drill at a fraction of the regular component rate. I could see the supplemental income being valuable and any additional income being helpful but the question asked if a military career was viable during the depression. Was the viability of active duty service tied more to the military providing food and housing than the actual pay rate?
