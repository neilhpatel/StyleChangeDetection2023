No professional Ming historian, but I do know of some card games then, so I did a little digging. Here's what I found.
Among the many ideas discussed in this pitch, I wanted to list potential side-activities steeped in the culture of that specific period as opposed to just citing broad pastimes and tropes used in a variety of increasingly generic Eastern fiction (specifically Western media's depictions of Eastern history & folklore, if you catch my meaning).
Not a good writer so I can't offer any help in that. But as a native Chinese speaker, I do read up quite substantially on Chinese history in my free time, so I would be glad to help out in those aspects! I will drop you a dm .
This leads into AC Chronicles wherein she begins a lenhy counterattack, successfully killing every member of the Eight Tigers and avenging her fellow Assassins who were lost in the purge before resolving to rebuild the Chinese Brotherhood as its new leader (being the only living master from the previous Brotherhood).

I'm currently researching to write an in-depth idea for an Assassin's Creed game set in Beijing (between 1514-1524), during the final years of the secret war between the Chinese Assassin Brotherhood and the Templar faction called the Eight Tigers. This is a tragic but compelling period in the fiction, originally a storyline from the AC comics.
