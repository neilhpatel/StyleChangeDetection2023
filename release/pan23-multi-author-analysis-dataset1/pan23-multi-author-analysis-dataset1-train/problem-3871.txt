2) Economical one — according to current calculations, I think that “all” of the current damage against Ukraine… about the same 300b. And this sum would be included in Russian-Ukrainian reparations. So, in case this sum would be misused… Ukraine would be in ruins, without money and with another corruption scandal.
Ukrianian here. Yeah corruption exists (through I personally haven’t met it ) but society hates it and fights it as well. That’s why I would like those seized russian money to be handled through some kind of EU organisation, it will not only make everything much more clear for any of the west political powers and societies but also will help to integrate my country into EU system more. I think it will be good if there will be EU organisation that will be creating orders for let’s say rebuilding this building in this place, where companies from both EU and Ukraine will be fighting to get this order to be done. This will help with integration and also improvement of Ukrainian business.
