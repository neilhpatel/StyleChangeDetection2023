Based on the way the current system is set up, that would be the best move. The polite fiction of non-partisan judges is dead. We don't need legal scholars on the court, just people who will vote in lockstep with liberal opinion. Anyone literate enough to read an article in the Washinon Post or New York Times would be sufficient. It wouldn't hurt if they are health nuts as well.
Most of those are voter-related (1-3 don't directly affect the Court, but they did affect Democrats' ability to win future elections by denying them legislative wins to campaign on, making 6-8 more likely; 7 has no real affect on the Court, but is still consequential; and 10-13 affect the ability to unpack the Court by adding seats).
I still get pissed off when I think of RBG. The woman was in constant failing health for the better part of the last entire decade of her life but refused to step aside when the left had a chance to replace her with someone that would champion the same causes and ideals that she herself championed. Her ego wouldn't let her relinquish power and it fucked over the entire country.
