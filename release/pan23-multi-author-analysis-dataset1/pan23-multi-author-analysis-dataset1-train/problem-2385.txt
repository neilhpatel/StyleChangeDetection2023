First of all, you have no ownership in this house, so why you probably realize that it’s important to reiterate. Right now you are a month-to-month tenant, and she is your landlord, which means that she can give you 30 day notice to vacate at any time, and then you would have to move out within 30 days. It’s possible that renting to you officially would be illegal, it’s probably not, but unless this is to assuage her fears and I suspect it’s not, it does not really matter. She doesn’t have to sign an official lease with you if she does not want to. Nor do you have to sign one with her if you do not want to.
Absolutely. However it appears she does not want protection, she wants convenience and ease. Perhaps ease and convenience if she were to decide she no longer wants me there and can just sort of flip a switch and make it happen with me having zero legal recourse. I will be honest, legal advice aside, we have run into 1 or 2 personal/relationship issues where I questioned if she would do just that and leave me out in the street. So this is why I am here asking this question.
