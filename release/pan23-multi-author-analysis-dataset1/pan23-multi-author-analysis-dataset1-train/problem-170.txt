I am Singaporean, not Swiss. To be honest, I think you are underestimating the exceptional break from neutrality a lot of countries have made for Ukraine. You cannot expect quick response from countries who have decades of international agreements, internal laws, policies, and social conventions reinforcing that neutrality.
Nope. The sanctions are for CCP officials over the human rights violations of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region. The semi-conductor sanctions are a separate geopolitical issue and relate to US controlled companies.
Not quite. Switzerland is well known for its close economical connection to China. They very much do rely on eachother, so I don't think Switzerland would have a reaction like that.
Yes, they offer refuge, but they don't offer anything beyond because the Chinese fight any attempt of the refugees on a real life in Switzerland.
Refugees can't even have proper legal jobs because Switzerland doesn't want to get into a fight with China over their embassies blocking those people by withholding papers.
