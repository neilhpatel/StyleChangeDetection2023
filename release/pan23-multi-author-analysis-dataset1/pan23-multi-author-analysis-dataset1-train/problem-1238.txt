They push anger. Angry people (mob mentality) are easily controlled. If you get the mob angry at social issues they won’t care that you are robbing them. It’s like the LBJ quote that’s often shared. The whole purpose of right wing radio in the 80’s and Fox News today is to get people angry and scared. That’s it. Then the politicians can pay lip service to the angry and scared mob while they rob the populace of their future. It’s just a grift on a massive level. Really it’s brilliant in it’s understanding of people and the fears that it plays on, but it’s just a slight of hand to get the people to look one direction while their futures and futures of their children are stolen.
