Yep. Grew up in a very rural, very red part of PA. Worked construction in the summers and would be ridiculed by the workers for wanting to go to college. Then when I went back to my 20 year HS reunion there was a very distinct divide between those that stayed in town and were "loyal, faithful and still had small town beliefs" and those that went off to college/moved away were very looked down upon by those that stayed. Huge distrust of anyone that gets "educated".
