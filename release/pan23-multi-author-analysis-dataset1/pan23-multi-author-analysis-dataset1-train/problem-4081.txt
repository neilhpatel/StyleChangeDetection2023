Yep. I was trying to buy a house while the interest rates were at rock bottom during covid and almost every single house that went on the market in my area was gone in less than 3 days and was bought with cash by people out of state for insane amounts over asking. Now a lot of them are rentals that are sitting empty because they want way too much for rent. The last house I looked at before I gave up went up for rent a few weeks later for about 3/4 over what my mortgage would have been.

For example-Like they just announced adding a new irs tax that anyone who uses Venmo or Apple Pay or any other type of credit card processing app for their small business or to send money to people has to report any profits over $600 and fill out a form - and they said if you don’t do the form you are automatically audited… so funny cuz they promised to audit the wealthy and corporations with the new irs hires… but instead they are going after gig economy, small businesses, and anyone who for example buys a couch for $600 then sells it on eBay for $1200 they must report it & pay tax on it… I picture a lot of landscaper type jobs and stay at home moms selling products will now have another big tax —-.
