There is a cultural affliction in Russia that we just don’t understand, it’s something in the lines of: I don’t give a shit about any one else, and they won’t give a shit about me. They don’t care about some else at all and just want to fly under the radar. It’s a thing that’s been this way for a long time because of the regimes that’s been in place there for so long.
Exactly. Although I would say we are understanding it now. It's called "I am Russian and that makes me special". Fuck you, you're not fucking special you fucking humans.
Because there was a a concerted effort by the Russians to help trump win the election with polling information and directed disinformation campaigns aimed at causing dissolution with the democratic process to further their geopolitical goals of taking territory to bring back the Soviet Union and damage the United States as much as possible.
Here’s the thing; those bodies don’t matter. They are criminals who were sent from prison to the slaughterhouse with the promise of getting to go free.
And what do violent criminals do when freed? They commit violent crimes. The pictures are evidence of Putin doing the people of Russia a favor; no more expending resources on prisoners, no more threat back home. It’s a win win.
Russia does not currently have enough ammunition/machinery/weapons to accomplish its current goals.
1. Destabilize the internal democratic process in the US to foster division. A large part of this is the whole succession argument from the hardest of hard right. It’s the only way Russia can actually damage the US in any meaningful way that doesn’t result in a nuclear exchange. This is what the Soviet Union was good at, causing division to split countries against themselves to create advantageous geopolitical landscapes.
A better question to ask is how would russia position it’s self to benefit from the geopolitical landscape. It’s not hard to follow the bread crumbs.
