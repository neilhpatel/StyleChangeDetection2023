So /u/verrevert's answer does a good job of getting to a key point, namely that outward expressions of grief, particularly by women, have grave moral implications in the developed Roman state--whether that can be said to be true during the time of the decemvirs is a matter for another time. However, it doesn't really deal with what is sort of the crucial point here, namely why, in a legal code otherwise apparently unconcerned with moral and ethical problems (as opposed to the Augustan legal project), an ethical law appears. And that's basically because the prohibition on female grief is not really a moral one, although it certainly plugs into a larger fear of female grief in Roman society. It's a sumptuary law.
It's been a while since I studied Roman history but I believe one of the reasons we learned for this was that aristocratic families would pay people to follow around a funeral procession and wail / mourn for them, basically turning funerals into aristocratic competitions of who could have the most mourners. Was this another reason for the law?
