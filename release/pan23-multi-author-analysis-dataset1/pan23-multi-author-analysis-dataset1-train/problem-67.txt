What they are saying is, "we have yet to find a legitimate religious exemption, but if we do, then the issue changes into what accommodation can be made, and we cannot figure out any accommodation that is reasonable, so we're covered under the law.".
There could be an issue with the medical exemptions part, but religious exemptions everywhere have been fairly hard to obtain because there are only a few religions that have actual stances against vaccinations.
Thank you. I know that a lot of places have been selective about the exemptions they are approving but have not heard about management actively encouraging employees not to file. That’s what I was wondering about, if they can legally encourage and threaten staff with a guaranteed position if they file an exemption. It was my understanding that if an exemption WAS granted, reasonable accommodations would need to be made. They are telling staff that if they receive an exemption, they (as in administration) would not even be guaranteeing that staff members have a job.
Managers are telling employees that they will most likely not have their exemptions approved. If it’s not intimidation it’s at the very least coercion. That’s what I’m asking about.
Encouraging is, by definition, not coercion. Coercion is basically "encouragement plus threats." What they are doing is to help you prepare for the inevitable. File away.
