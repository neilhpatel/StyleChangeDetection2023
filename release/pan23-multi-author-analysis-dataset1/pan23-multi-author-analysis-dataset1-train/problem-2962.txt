As you already admit yourself in the question, you're asking about 2 very different things: the world of Homer and Bronze Age Greece. It's important to keep the two completely separate. The Homeric epics contain some references to the Greek world in the Late Bronze Age (c. 1250-1100 BC), but the Greeks of the time when it was composed (c. 700 BC) did not have a memory of such an age and did not understand the technological implications of setting a story in that age. Instead, the Homeric epics are set in the Age of Heroes, which is emphatically not a time of normal humans and human history. Its warfare is most likely inspired by the contemporary warfare of the early Archaic period, when both bronze and iron were in general use.
Absolutely. This distinction along with other inconsistencies including narrative style, theology, and vocabulary are large enough that pretty much every scholar believes that they were composed by separate authors.
Could the same be true for bronze age Greece? That we just did not find the right excavation sites yet?
