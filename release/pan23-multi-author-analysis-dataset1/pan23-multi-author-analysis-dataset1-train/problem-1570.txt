Okay thank you, if that happens and I don't have anything they claim. I even tried to login into any of my email accounts with a generic password I use for sites idc about for Dropbox and I don't have any accounts registered with Dropbox, even when searching my emails for account confirmations I didn't find any.
No, if nobody was home they'd come back or try and find you somewhere else. If there is enough evidence that links you to a crime - you're getting arrested. If there is not enough evidence to link you to the crime, then they'd probably pull you in for questioning to try and get you to incriminate yourself. Nobody is sending a letter. If, after discussing it with a lawyer, and the lawyer advises reporting it to the police/Dropbox, then you'd be reporting this activity as a scam (and potential set up for future blackmail) - this letter is fishy. Just because it uses a username you do use, doesn't mean this piece of information alone would link it to you. CP is incredibly serious, and nobody is going to warn a suspect that they're on to them. But this is why I'm saying don't report it without first discussing it with a lawyer, because a lawyer could also contact the people on the letter and try and find out whether it is legitimate, or what the best actions are, and start gathering evidence that this username is not yours.
