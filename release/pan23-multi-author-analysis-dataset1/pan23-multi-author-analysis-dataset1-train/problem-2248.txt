The fact that you're only talking about Ukraine is indeed rather telling in its selectiveness. There are lots of other incredibly unpleasant things going on in the world, but because they aren't particularly relevant or interesting geopolitically to the supposed world police, they barely even get talked about -- which is why having a single state deciding what is worth and what isn't worth policing and to what extent is just not a good idea.
Yes. After the Ottoman Empire broke up, the UK took over and had a mandate from the League of Nations to establish a there. But they didn’t and just kept control of it. Then, after WWII, the UK threw their hands up and said “UN, you decide what to do.” The UN General Assembly voted to divide it into two states—an Arab one and a Jewish one. The Jews said “OK” and the Arabs said “no,” and a civil war started. The UK left, Israel declared independence, and the surrounding countries intervened in favor of the Palestinians. But they lost so Israel became a country.
Literally. They want the biggest asshole they can find at the top. The more people he insults or kills and the more corrupt shit he gets away with, the better.
