One potential silver lining is that Republicans have gerrymandered almost as much as they can, so if the overall trend of the population becoming more liberal holds, they'll be up against a wall. Not that there aren't other techniques they can use (unnecessary voter requirements, unbalanced polling locations, etc., plus, you know, violence) but it'll be harder and harder for them to hold on to power. I suspect this might be part of the reason they are lashing out now, while they still have a chance.

Regardless, Gerrymandering is an absolutely un-Democratic, horribly corrosive tool to systematically subvert elections and the will of the people. Two wrongs do NOT make a right.
