as a single example, In United States v. Ulbricht, the Court approved forfeiture of over 183 billion dollars that was concerned with the Silk Road operation and bitcoin, and specifically held: "there is broad statutory authority to forfeit any property “involved in” money laundering, which the court here held could include the use (and from that, the forfeiture) of Bitcoin to engage in money laundering" See discussion in Shirley U. Emehelu, A Shot in the Dark: Using Asset Forfeiture Tools to Identify and Restrain Criminals' Cryptocurrency, 66 DOJ J. Fed. L. & Prac. 81, 99–100 (2018).
I am appallingly opposed to civil forfeiture, and there are abuses that absolutely do elevate the risk because the financial "reward" to the enforcement agency is appealing. At the same time, I find it too hyperbolic to make arguments using scare language like the "headlines" in their comment/links contain without qualifying them clearly with "but the government's effort to seize failed," or, like here, your statement of the risk being "substantial." That's my only concern with your responses (and the above poster's,) not that I disagree it is either theoretically possible, or am unconcerned with the whole "holy shit the expense involved of defending the property is perhaps not worth it" factor.
Get rid of the atm. If you keep it, there is a substantial risk that the feds will seize and forfeit your entire store as property used to commit money laundering.
