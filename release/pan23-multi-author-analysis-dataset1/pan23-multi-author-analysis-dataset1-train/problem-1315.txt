Considering how ukraine has been supplied with military equipment as well as resources while russia is being mostly denied resouces and military equipment i wonder who will actually get exausted first.
Why not? They can use the same air defence they have now, and more when the peace keeping force gets there and sets up a buffer zone, in which Russia canâ€™t shell Ukraine without hitting said peace keeping force and triggering escalation. Which we know they are scared of.
They don't report it in the MSM but Ukraine is really getting destroyed and no it can't fight this war for another 10 years simply because to match Russia's 10 year pace is a level of commitment to fighting that would burn out Ukraine in a couple of years - in fact it would of already if not for the huge support it gets.
OP is not completely wrong. Ukraine can a absolutely lose a war of attrition. It's just a matter of numbers. That is why Ukraine is working hard to win this as fast as possible but heavier weapons are not being supplied because of some motherfuckers in the EU.
