\[Biden shouldn't be impeached for the documents. He should be impeached for refusing to enforce the law on the southern border (dereliction of duty), putting America at risk. Effectively, he's single-handedly destroying the country. We cannot absorb millions of poor, unassimilated migrants. It is creating chaos and financial problems in cities across the country. It's increasing crime, and enabling a free flow of fentanyl that is killing record numbers of Americans (originating from China, sent through the border by the cartels). And don't tell me that our enemies haven't snuck sleeper cells through the porous border. Biden is enriching the cartels, harming Mexico, enabling enemies to attack us from within, while suing states that are trying to slow the flood of illegal crossings. Love or hate Trump as you wish, but he had the border situation under control. Then Biden took office...\].
