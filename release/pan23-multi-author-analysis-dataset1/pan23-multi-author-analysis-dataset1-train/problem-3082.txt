About 350 years after Nanni's legendary complaint on receiving poor copper from Ea-Nasir, another, perhaps more historically important complaint was sent from King Burraburiash of Babylon, 19th to the Kassite throne, to Akhenaten, Pharaoh of Egypt.
All right. Metal trading is not my particular specialty, but this seems to have been unanswered for a long time, and I have the sources to tackle it. Tragically, however, I do not read Akkadian and cannot give a detailed commentary on the words used in the original language. It’s a shame because the actual Akkadian words might give some more nuance about what was wrong with the ingots (or they might well not and the ingots might be described in words that just mean generic evilness). I can’t say!
(The "Archimedes method" involving volume wasn't in use at this time, and the specific gravity of copper makes it not a good candidate for assays; gold's specific gravity, on the other hand, is more than double and easier to differentiate from contaminating metals.).
Interesting question. It might be worth asking in its own thread, although I’m not sure it would receive a definitive answer, since I’m not sure we have the evidence to talk definitively about the nuances of 18th century BCE local market rules and norms of Ur. But I’ll say what I can.
Given the quality must have been determined _somehow_, the best guess is that while touchstones weren't fully developed, a method for checking involved scraping and comparing colors with known samples was likely in use.
Experimental archaeology published by J.F. Merkel (see Further Reading) found that black copper required four additional melts to get the iron content down from about 5% to trace levels. That’s considerable additional work, even allowing for the fact that an ancient metallurgist with a lifetime of practice might have been better at the job than a modern archaeologist.
