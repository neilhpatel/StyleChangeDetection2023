If this peace process works and actually achieves peace, which is no small feat, China wins by appearing as a force of global peace, Ukraine wins by maintaining sovereignty and territorial integrity, and Russia wins a little by saving face.
I mean, he's not wrong. Diplomatically speaking, China doesn't get to decide how the war ends or continues, it would just have the role of moderation in peace talks. The US and other European countries don't have that option because theyve committed to arming and training Ukraine. None of them can be a neutral arbitrator.
Interesting move. This meeting will be beneficial for both side. My doubt still remain thought. It's clearly normal for China to talk one way and act in another.
Intent isn’t establishable. Maybe they’re doing it out of “goodness” or maybe they’re doing it out of vested interests. All we know is what we can see, thus “appearing”.
I have zero doubt that if and when this war ends China will come in and build roads and buildings and sports arenas, at low cost cutting a ton of corners, just to say they did it and juat to boost their own economy and the actual political gains are secondary simply because a lot of countries don't actually pivot to China in any meaningful way as a result to begin with.
