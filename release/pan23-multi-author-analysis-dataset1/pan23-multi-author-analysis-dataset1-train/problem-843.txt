Russia's real population is somewhere around 300 million (143 million today) if it weren't for all the famine, war, brain drain and incompetent regimes such as this one.
They’re super delusional apparently. They won’t have peace talks unless the west recognizes the annexed regions. The annexed regions which they don’t even control, and where their presence is shrinking daily. Stupid.
Russia has no plans to withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine that is under annexation assessment as per the directive of the supreme leadership, in light of the ongoing special military operation's activated objectives and subsequent performance, which necessitate the territorial acknowledgement of a Ukrainian entity which is contingent on negotiated territorial boundaries to be considered, reviewed, and approved by the necessary officials whom are granted constitutional authority to establish markers of permanence, at which point territorial assessments and delineating markers may be accurately described through geographic representations published through the appropriate channels.
