No they wouldn't. Texas law for renters sucks, but a clause that ties them into a renewal without knowing about the amount of the increase would be void as against public policy. I imagine it would be construed differently, however. I'd have to see the provisions of the lease to say for sure how it would be construed. Depending on where OP is in Texas there is plenty of free help available.
Automatic renewal and notice of termination: this lease automatically renews on a moth to month basis unless landlord or tenant provides the other party of written notice of termination as provided in paragraph 4a. Oral notice of termination is not sufficient under any circumstances. Time is the essence for providing notice of termination and the date on which rent is due does not apply to the requirement for providing written notice of termination.
This lease will automatically renew on month to month basis unless landlord or tenant provides the other party written notice of termination not less than 60 days before the expiration date.
The two areas that are most important are the move out notification which requires 60 days notice by either party and would only come into effect after the end of the original lease (which ended in August). We are required to pay through the end of the month that said 60 days ends - which makes sense to me. She notified us on September 23 that the rent was going up and we said we couldnâ€™t do that and are putting in our notice to move out.
