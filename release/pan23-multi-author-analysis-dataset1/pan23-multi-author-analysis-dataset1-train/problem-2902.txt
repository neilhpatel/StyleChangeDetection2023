I don't have the book here so I'm not able to check, but I wouldn't be surprised if Von Staab was right. Bucholz' main argument is that the growing importance and status accorded to the Great General Staff in Prussian society and war led to a tunnel-vision idea of how the next war must be fought. It was increasingly impossible to question the authority of the GGS on such matters, especially after the victories of 1866 and 1871. No doubt his argument would be that it might have been possible to change the MTP (though it would take a gargantuan effort of the Railway Section of the GGS), but that Moltke would not have allowed it, having already become fixed on the plan he had so meticulously prepared.
They could have no children. This was (is still) an issue in more affluent places where, because of more people not having children, the population is ageing. There have been pushes in such cases for people to have more than one kid even before the one child policy was changed recently in order to combat it, allowing a number of exceptions.
