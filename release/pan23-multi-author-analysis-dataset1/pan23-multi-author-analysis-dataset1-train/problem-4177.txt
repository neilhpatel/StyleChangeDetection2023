Being solicited for sex is a frequent occurrence for massage parlor workers. The most common response is simply to decline, and/or ask the client to leave immediately and/or not return. In general, massage parlors don't want to invite police scrutiny, especially those which have a reputation for hosting and promoting prostitution.
I appreciate it. It was a low moment that I deeply regret and I tend to beat myself up. I went there in the past a long time ago and they started touching me without asking for money or anything. My drunk self have into temptation. Thanks for the reassurance.
I can tell you that in my jdx, the only way we pursue prostitution clients is in industrial-scale undercover operations where we take over a website or brothel (usually a massage parlor) and staff it entirely with undercover police. We spend a whole day welcoming johns, having them offer money for sex, then hustling them out the back door to be booked, charged, and released with no bail required. All of them are offered a plea deal for probation.
Occasionally illicit businesses are placed under surveillance by law enforcement agencies. This can and occasionally does include interior audio / video surveillance. The simple solution is, of course, to avoid breaking the law.
