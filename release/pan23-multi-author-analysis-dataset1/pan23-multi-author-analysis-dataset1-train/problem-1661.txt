He bought it from someone the bought it from a tow yard as a lean sale.. I have the certificate of registry with the registered owners name and address that was mailed to the registered owner but never heard back so I have the application for title or registration all filled out ready to go.. my understanding was I needed the smog done before they would register the vehicle.. I found out at the police department that I can still register the car it would just be incomplete.. that would have been fine I would have went straight to the dmv I have all the paperwork ready I have the bill of sale from when the vehicle was purchased from the tow yard I have the bill of sale from when the guy that I bought the car from bought the car from the person that bought it from the tow yard and I have the bill of sale from when I bought the vehicle.
Sounds like you got scammed. If the person who "sold" you the car wasn't the owner of the car, they had no legal ability to sell it to you. Did you not get the title with the bill of sale?
