Summer (Here in the Northern Hemisphere anyway) is starting to come to a close, but the good times keep rolling on Askhistorians. Below you will find the usual weekly assortment of fantastic threads, along with some special notices and the weekly regulars. This one is extra special because its almost that I started this fun little project. My but how time flies, and what a difference Look at that adorable little list compared to this leviathan.
Since I was mainly wondering if there would have been a question of the constitutionality of women voting in a federal election, and everything I can find about Wyoming just says that women could vote with no mention of restrictions, I think the answer is (probably) that they could, though I would still appreciate a definitive answer if someone has one!
I followed up on my question a little bit, and while I didn't find a definitive answer, I did find a source saying that Illinois was allowing women to vote in presidential elections by 1913, and in Wilson by A. Scott Berg, the author says that Woodrow Wilson was in favor of Women's Suffrage, but felt it was an issue best left to the states, rather than a national act, which would imply that there wasn't any sort of national consensus that women were explicitly prohibited from voting under the Constitution at the time Wilson was president.
Thanks for the mention! I was so close to getting two posts in the digest this week, and I missed it by eight minutes. But oh well, it means I get to see my name next week as well for no extra effort.
Unfortunately they don't really. They get removed from the front page and the only way to get to them is through a link. Which is why I try to go out of my way to make sure they get included in here Hopefully someone will see it that way.
