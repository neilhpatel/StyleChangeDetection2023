After Afghanistan, the US military intelligience was conservative in their estimates of belligerent forces, it's better to plan for a more powerful adversely than a weaker adversary. Even assuming basic military readiness on Russia's part should have seen them make better inroads than they did. The irony is Russia saw the US acceptance of Russian propoganda as legitimate estimates of Russia's true strenh which made them more confident in their outcome.
I don't know about drills. From my understanding the experts agree the first hour would inflict the most casualties. After that the populace should (in theory) be sheltered in place.
Ironically the Afghanistan government and Russia suffered from the same problems: widespread corruption, which is apparently extremely difficult to Guage the effectiveness of the forces arrayed since intelligence would rely on intercepting internal reports of readiness over trying to infiltrate every base and station to see how effective it would be.

Regardless, the Russian invasion was an actually distinct possibility, Putin had demonstrated the pattern of behavior already.
