Thanks for the great answer! I have visited plenty of Roman cities across all of Europe, but not in Africa or Middle East. Which would be the best preserved ones (and safe to visit, after Covid)?
Now imagine every city in the empire is going through transformations and additions and subtractions across time, and what you come to is that the empire was not uniform with its cities, the dress would not have been entirely uniform, the local culture that predates the Romans would have changed the occupying culture to one extent or another towards its own roots, making each local culture different from another local culture, sometimes even just a few miles down the coast or a road, etc.
Thanks for the answer! I learned that the Romans generally didnâ€™t actively try to change the culture in the provinces, although of course Romanization would happen to some degree. I imagined the empire as very diverse, with a mix of Roman and local culture. But since the author of the linked article is an historian, I was surprised by such a strong statement.
