How could anyone trust Russia to keep to its side of a negotiated settlement anyway. They've done nothing but lie. I can't help but think they'd use any ceasefire as an opportunity to re-arm and attack again.
The international community will never accept the illegal annexation of Ukranian territory, let alone the Ukranian people.
Thatâ€™s not true. The German army was basically stripped to the bone. The German Air Force was prohibited from having planes and the German Navy was confiscated. Parts of western Germany were occupied by the French and British and war reparations levied as part of the Versailles Treaty were ruinous to the German economy. The Germans knew that they lost the war but the emerging far right in the 1920s and 30s blamed communists and Jews on the home front for stabbing the German Army in the back and losing the war. It was all bullshit because the German Army was crumbling during the Hundred-Days Offensive and would have completely collapsed had the war not ended on 11 Nov 1918.
In what way? It was a civil war before russia illegally sent its army to occupy the land, if the west sponsored it like it does with this war ukraine would have qon and qe wouldn't have 2022 war.
