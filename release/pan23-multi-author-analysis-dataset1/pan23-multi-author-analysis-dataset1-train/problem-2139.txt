To generalise out from the discussion on Mt. Olympus in other threads – both answers raise the bigger issue of how Greeks engaged with received, traditional wisdom about the gods. They also touch on a broader problem of studying this task, which is that most people don’t leave a record of their fundamental, basic and generally uncontentious beliefs about the nature of the world, and most people from the ancient world don’t leave a record at all. It’s generally agreed that a literacy rate of about 20-30% was high for a well-educated, cosmopolitan Hellenistic city, though this could vary massively. There’s little evidence for reading and writing in Sparta at all, while the Athenian democracy of the 5th and 4th centuries appears to have been highly literate – in Aristophanes’ comedy The Knights, even a sausage-seller can read at least a little, and participation in key civic and political rituals such as ostracism required at least the ability to scratch someone’s name into a pot. So by and large, the evidence we have skews towards the views of highly educated, philosophically-trained men with active interests in debate and controversy – towards the cynical end of the scale, in other words.
Hold up. Is it Nails' original thesis that the trial of Sokrates took place this early, and not in the conventional year 399 BC? Does she present any evidence for this? It seems impossible in light of the evidence from the Apology that Sokrates was alive during the reign of the Thirty in 403 BC.
