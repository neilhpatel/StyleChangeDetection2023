You've obviously forgotten more about the Fall of France than I've ever learned, but I have to question whether a lack of initiative in the French army is something 'easily rectified'. It takes three centuries to build a tradition, after all, or at least three generations of junior officers, field grades, and generals for an institutional culture to solidify. It's not easy to rework the culture of a big and doctrinaire institution like a regular army towards aggression and independence under the best of circumstances, and doubly so with very short service conscription and an inferior air force, as well as all the other political and economic constraints of the interwar French Army.
I don't think it takes quite that long. In the French case, it took about three years to go from a spirit of aggression and fighting elan to a slow, methodical centrally controlled system: Compare the French Army of 1914 to that of 1917. Now, granted, there was the impetus of a war, and the guys in charge in 1940 would have been around to see the difference in success for the French between 1914 and 1918, and were thus well motivated to lean towards the latter system but I don't think it's something set by generation. And the argument certainly doesn't hold for their insistence on couriers vice radio: If they had done that, even their central-management system could likely have been sufficient, commanders demonstrating initiative are more of a fall-back in this case.
