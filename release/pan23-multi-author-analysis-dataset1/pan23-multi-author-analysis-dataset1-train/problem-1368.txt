While stealing mail may seem like small-time stuff, \any\ tampering with USPS mail can carry some serious federal charges. If she were smart, she'd know how much trouble she is in. You can also report USPS mail theft to postal inspectors. She evidently has a problem and should be straightened out sooner than later. She could be ruining your credit, obtaining a copy of your license, and all sorts of bad things. At the very least you may want to contact the 3 major credit agencies to receive copies of your credit scores, place locks on your credit, and sign up for credit alerts. And, yes, you need to get that mail moved asap cause she's gonna be ticked. I know it stinks, but see if you can get a PO BOX and then fill out a National Change of Address (NCOA) form to have all of your mail forward to the PO Box at least until you have time to either change all of your addresses or change your roommate Good luck.
You should lock your credit right away. She has your Social, address and other pertinent information and could easily open up accounts under your name.
