> An analysis by the watchdog group Documented has traced funding for the Arizona audit back to Trump’s Save America Pac. The group tracked the cash as it passed from Trump’s fund through an allied conservative group, and from there to a shell company which in turn handed the money to contractors and individuals involved in the Arizona audit.
So... The act of giving money or other assets with the purpose of influencing someone's opinion or decision in your favor is called a "donation" nowadays. Not bribing.... Right....
It is money he mostly controlled, but it’s not 💯 fungible money - he can’t just spend it on hookers, it has to be laundered via some process (paying for hotel rooms at one of his shitty hotels, used as a hush payment etc) so there’s a significant discount on its value to him. It is interesting that he’d use that much, say, 20%-cash on something so dumb, but I think it’s explainable via 1) it’s a ballache to steal from his PAC 2) it was probably “spent” by one of his minions helping to enable what they imagine his idiotic fantasies are.
