As a preliminary matter, because child support is usually based on a percentage of a parent's net income, after getting married, a parent's net income may increase due to tax benefits. Other factors, such as a decrease in the cost of living for a remarried spouse, can also be factored in by a court to reduce a child support award. In the end, while a stepparent usually cannot be forced to pay, or have their wages garnished, if their spouse is paying child support, they are paying too, even if they're not legally liable.
A stepparent will generally not be required to pay child support for a spouse's children from a prior relationship. Courts usually will not even consider how much a stepparent earns. However, depending on the specific facts of a case, a stepparent's income can still make a significant difference in the amount of support that must be paid for a biological parent.
IANAL. You haven't indicated the state, but I am aware that some states will take a new spouse's income into account when determining the income of the ex-spouse, and how much support is owed to the ex. Consequently, I recommend that you and your husband consult a family law attorney to work out how to provide the information that the court has ordered without providing your information. If you're really concerned about this, in future years you may need to consider filing separately if that is possible.
