Correct, you cannot unregister your car. The process is kicked off when the seller shows up at the DMV with the signed title and pays the sales tax to register the car in their name, until then you are the registered owner in their database. However that does not make you the legal owner of the car. That is what your proof of sale gives them. The DMV has no concept of unregistering cars because each car always need an owner and not getting pulled over for driving without plates is suppose to be the incentive for the buyer to go register it in their name.
Contact the DMV and see what you should do if you accidentally forgot to take the plates off before selling the vehicle.
Not necessarily. If you don't have a transponder and go through a toll, the bill goes to whomever the license plate it registered to. That is how the River link ones around Louisville, KY work. I have an EZPass Transponder in my car now so it pulls from my balance, but before I got it I still got the bills since they had cameras that scanned license plates too.
