Importantly, you should also be aware that they are obligated to mitigate, but they are not obligated to do it on your schedule--they can take time to clean the property, show it, get applications, qualify applicants, et cetera. This can potentially take a couple of months, especially when the rental market is slow, and you are still responsible for the rent during this time.
You admit to signing a one-year lease agreement, but you are not claiming that the landlord agreed to a six-month term--only that the landlord acknowledged that you stated were moving out in six months. That changes nothing about your legal requirement to pay twelve months of rent, unless and until the landlord finds a way to mitigate--either by finding a suitable renter at an equal price, or settling for lower rent and charging you for the difference (which is also completely legal).
The 16th. Cleaned and everything the next Monday. Was ready by the 20th. This was told to them by the 8th. They scheduled the inspection yesterday the 26th. Granted not at the time they had said.
