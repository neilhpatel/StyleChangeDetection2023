To put it in other terms: if the police would only arrest poor ppl for murder, that doesn't automatically make the law against murder unfair. It may just mean that the police are bigots or corrupt. Or maybe that other person wasn't a suspect yet. You'd need the demonstrate that the text of the law explicitly prevents the police from arresting non-poor ppl (or whatever specific exclusion) for murder to show the problem is not how the police apply the law, but that the law itself simply can't be applied in a fair way.
I agree. These Islamist countries are like your racist uncle Jerry. You tell him, "Jerry, we want you at Thanksgiving, but you can't come until you stop dropping N-bombs with a hard R at the table.".
Anyone thinking Morocco has leverage over the EU when push comes to shove is either ignorant or delusional, especially after 2022 demonstrated the sheer institutional force the EU can bring to bear when one trade partner overplays their hand and threatens to destroy Europe by cutting it off from a resource it's supposedly impossible for it to reorient from.
1. Yeah, because atrocities that happened 400 years ago is the same as atrocities being committed now. Oh, and which counties accepted migrants from arab nations when you were all killing each other in civil wars? Such hatred.
