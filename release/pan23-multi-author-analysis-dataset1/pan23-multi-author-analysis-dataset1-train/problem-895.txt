Not really an apt comparison. Syria pulled an ace out of their sleeve in the form of a shitload of religious nutjobs, foreigners and Syrian, that they had stuffed into their prisons and tortured, radicalizing them further. They released them which in turn led to radicalization of a shitload of freedom fighters, leading to a polarizing effect where the apparent option for some parts of the country were foreign backed islamist radicals or domestic dictator. There was a legit freedom fighter contingent in the beginning of the war but these religious nutjobs infiltrated a lot of those groups and brought foreign money and weapons support with them.
I mean, halfway through the war we had literally hardcore Sunni fundamentalist fighters, all touting the same batshit ideology, shooting the shit out of each other AND other freedom fighters because they were backed by different countries or organizations.
This is very sad. Imagine if 15,000 insiders of Iranian regime got executed instead. How many problems that would solve! Is karma ever going to get them?
"Now, the public, even protesters who are not supportive of riots, demand from the judiciary and security institutions to deal with the few people who have caused disturbances in a firm, deterrent, and legal manner," Iranian government spokesman Masoud Setayeshi said, according to Reuters.
Is it? We have the governement we have because our forebears rose up and made it change via civil war. Most democracies have that in common. If the population of a country isnt willing to fight for themselves then those in power will rule with absolute authority and nobody to tell them boo.
