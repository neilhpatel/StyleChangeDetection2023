Joe REALLY has the wind at his back now. Plus (I think) Wisconsin and Penn won their legislatures. MI won the Trifecta. So fuck Florida and Texas, our path through victory is through those states now. And once those legislatures start passing more good policy they should invite Biden so he can associate with that region and the policies. Plus his support for Ukraine which has completely brought Russia to a halt (and a retreat rn lol). Its a fantastic record. His jobs record is unparalleled. All thats left is the economy, and if its good going into 2024, then Republicans have very few actual attacks except their stupid cultural grievance. No one cares about those.
If I have to pick a mostly good natured man who will have a vice president to step in if he truly becomes senile, or Trump (also a senility risk), or a Republican bent on gutting everything I think will help people, I'm gonna vote for my sides 80 year old.
Just wait. We'll be back to trying to appease Manchin and Sinema to do something for the good of the country in no time once the horse race is finally over.
