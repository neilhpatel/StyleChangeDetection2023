Doing something that makes their movement look stupid and turns it into a punchline is worse than doing nothing.
That makes it even dumber, because people are still going to get angry about what sounds like damage to the paintings. So now they need an extra step to explain it was fake vandalism before they can even get around to explaining how real or fake vandalism of paintings is supposed to relate to climate change.
They could start by gluing themselves to practically anything else high-profile that relates to climate change instead of artworks. That's something they haven't tried yet.
We're currently on a trajectory where the Earth's capacity to sustain life is being undermined, and yet you're not only complaining about undamaged art, but who do you think will appreciate that art if modern civilization collapses?
Don't arrest them. In fact, don't do anything. In each of these cases, the perps get rescued from their own actions by those who arrest them. Protect the art, but otherwise let them keep standing there, their hands glued, and let them faint.
