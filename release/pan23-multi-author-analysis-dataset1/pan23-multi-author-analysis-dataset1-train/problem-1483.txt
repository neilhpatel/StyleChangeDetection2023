The terms “square” and “triangular” when speaking of divisions refer to the number of infantry regiments, a “square” division having four (often under the control of two brigades) and a “triangular” division having three (with no brigades). The United States Army fought World War I with a (27,100 men) championed by General Pershing and Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, in comparison to smaller French, German, and British triangular or square divisions of 14,000-18,000 men. This structure persisted into the interwar period, with the 1920 division , and the 1932 square division being increased to 21,000 men. Due to restricted funding, only the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Divisions of the Regular Army were maintained at smaller "peace" tables of organization, the 4th through 9th Divisions being reduced to reinforced brigades and even temporarily losing their headquarters. The divisions of the National Guard (26th-45th, less the 39th and 42nd) were also reduced to “maintenance” tables of organization (anywhere from about 50-65% complete based on the "war" table for an infantry division, depending upon the total strenh authorized, and the strenh allotted to each of the states), while the Organized Reserve divisions (76th-91st and 94th-104th) had all their war officers, but only a small portion of their enlisted men, mostly critical noncommissioned officers.
1. Why did they have square divisions in WW1 and then switched to Triangular divisions in WW2? I assume this did not just happen in the USA.
For an organization with multiple iterations within a division, such as an infantry regiment, the subchart gives an example of the organization of only one regiment as representative, instead of all of them; this becomes useful when describing a subunit with five or six iterations within the same parent unit, such as the pentomic battle group. The . Each regiment had a headquarters and headquarters company (111 men), a service company (114), a cannon company (118), an antitank company (165), an attached medical detachment (135), and three infantry battalions (871 men each). Each battalion had a headquarters and headquarters company (126), three rifle companies (193 men each), and a heavy weapons company (156).
The were composed of a headquarters (9), and provided administration of the division headquarters company (110), the military police platoon (73), the ordnance light maintenance company (147), the quartermaster company (193), the signal company (226), and the band (56). The special troops also had an attached medical detachment (15).
