Japan as a state doesn't really form until the Yamato era 大和時代 in the 3rd-7th centuries AD. It's at that time when the Japanese "state" becomes more unified as tribal chieftains are brought into the fold. Polities seek acknowledgment of rulership from China via envoys. I alluded to that a bit in to another question on the imperial family origins. As stated there, the Hou Han Shu 後漢書 and archaeological evidence date Yayoi emissaries from the land of Na as early as 57 CE (Japan was called Wa 倭 at the time). Such investiture was important for a would-be ruler in Japan. Yuryaku would be the first "King of Wa" (Wa no o 倭之王 ) if you believe his letters to China. In reality, he was one of five paramounts with whom the Liu Sung dynasty maintained diplomatic contacts with in the 5th century- last of the five to send an emissary, but third to receive recognition.
Thanks! That really answered my question and then some. I figured some samurai might have seen a tiger or two in Korea, but I didn’t realize the importance went that far back.
