This is a very clear explanation, but I just want to add that Henry VII wasn't quite the LAST of Edward III's direct descendants, even after he defeated Richard Duke of York's last remaining son (Richard III) at the Battle of Bosworth. Even without touching on the Lambert Simnel or Perkin Warbeck rebellions, Henry faced threats to his reign in the forms of several of Edward IV and Richard III's nephews: Edward Earl of Warwick, the son of George Duke of Clarence, and John de la Pole, the son of Anne Duchess of Exeter (and since Henry VII himself was claiming descent from his mother, not his father [whose line was a mix of French & Welsh due to the marriage of Catherine of Valois, Henry V's French widow and Owen Tudor], there was an argument to be made that the son of the sister of the previous kings would have more of a right to rule than the son of a woman descended from a cadet line that Henry IV attempted to have barred from the succession entirely, though it's unclear how much legal weight that attempt carried). The fact that so many of Edward III's descendants had died was crucial to his success, but Henry VII largely established his claim through the right of conquest by defeating Richard III; his place as John of Gaunt's senior male descendant was undoubtedly important, but he wouldn't have become king without the successful conquest of his predecessor.
Thank you for the correction. I meant that more as a bit of hyperbole than statement of fact. I should have made that much more clear. There definitely were other potential claimants to the throne, as you so succinctly pointed out.
