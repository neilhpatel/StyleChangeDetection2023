This has been around for years and the process is very well understood. The problem is cost, and so far no one has cracked that nut.
The main innovation in the model are the novel electrodes, which have two key properties: they are porous, in order to maximise contact with water in the air, and they are transparent, in order to maximise solar radiation on the semiconductor coating.
Yes, I am aware of that. Imagine the air as a river. We caused great damage, by building dams, rerouting rivers etc. Why? Because our ecosystem not only cares on the amount of water in it, but also where and in what amount the water is in the system. If we start extracting water from air on a great scale and putting it back, by burning it, nobody can say, what the actual effect is going to be, because our ecosystem is extremely complex and can't be simulated in it's entirety.
Am I the only one who thinks, there's an unknown danger of extracting water from our air, split it into hydrogen, burn it in cars and expect everything to still be in balance, as soon as we do it on a great scale?
