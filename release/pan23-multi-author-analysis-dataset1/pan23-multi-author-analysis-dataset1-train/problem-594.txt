The child support order could potentially be modified, but that doesn't take the college expense into account. If she tries, it could make her child support amount go down if her income has grown faster than yours. But in any case, whatever the modified child support order is, it wouldn't cover college, it would take into account your income (so it would be "affordable" according to the legal formula), and it would terminate when your daughter turns 19 in any case.
Assuming there's nothing in the decree that would require you to pay for college, child support has a termination age - in Indiana, it's 19 (that is, you pay support up until their 19th birthday), but child support is based on a formula that doesn't take college into account.
Good luck! One bit of information I also found suggests that the court should not order you to pay educational support if your expected parental contribution from the FAFSA is zero. I don't know if you were involved in that or know what your expected contribution is, but if your income is low enough, it could be zero.
