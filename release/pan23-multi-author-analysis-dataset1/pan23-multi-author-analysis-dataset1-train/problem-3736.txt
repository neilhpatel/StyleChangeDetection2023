It is not really the case that Afghanistan gets invaded to an unusually high degree. The two invasions you mentioned happened because of particular historical circumstances, not because of some eternal quality that Afghanistan possesses.
So...he pretty much said 'Enough is enough' and did what he did. Whose side should one even take on a matter like this? There's no peaceful way to resolve these matters it seems...Is war and terror the only way? I'm really conflicted on this matter. I understand the history a lot better now but is war and terror the only solution? Is this when war/terror becomes a necessity? Kind of like when death becomes a necessity.
The narrative that Afghanistan naturally invites invasion and therefore is naturally prone to warfare is pernicious, because it can potentially feed into some destructive cultural perceptions and policy decisions. If a country is war-torn by nature (which is often said of Middle Eastern and African countries), then that can absolve people in the developed world of responsibility for that warfare (through how they vote and what they buy). It can also feed an unjustified sense of cultural superiority among people in industrialized countries.
