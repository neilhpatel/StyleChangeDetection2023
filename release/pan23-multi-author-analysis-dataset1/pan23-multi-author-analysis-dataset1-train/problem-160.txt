This could be argued in various ways because it's fiction and we don't have a lot of details. But I don't think the depiction of Don Draper's lifestyle-to-income situation is unrealistic. Here's one take:
With that said, I think that Don's income gets a bit detached from reality the further into the show we go: he starts out as accomplished talent living an upper-middle class lifestyle at a medium-sized Madison Avenue firm, but his lifestyle and implied wealth further on in the series seems to be much beyond even what a partner in such a size firm would be putting down. It's more Elvis than Ogilvy.
Eisenhower's advance cap gains classification was reduced because of a Congressional loophole for "amateur" authors. David McCullough characterizes it as kind of a sweetheart deal for Ike himself in the biography Truman as part of the discussion of why Harry wasn't able to get the same kind of deal. I'm curious to find out though what the tax avoidance strategies might have been once compensation had been paid as real income. I know that there were sheltered investments like oil and gas partnerships but I've never been able to figure out how a person with a high salary could have taxes refunded after they were paid as part of payroll. Granted, I've not done a lot of research around that but it is interesting.
