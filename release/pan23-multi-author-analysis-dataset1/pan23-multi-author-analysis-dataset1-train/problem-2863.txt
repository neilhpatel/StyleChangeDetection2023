NAL but familiar with check fraud. Under (federal) Regulation CC there are certain standards banks have to abide by with endorsements. You would need to file a fraud claim with the bank the check was issued at, asserting ‘your’ (the business) endorsement was forged. That bank should send a demand for the funds to Wells, and under that regulation Wells would need to return the funds to issuing bank, which can be a lenhy process because they’re a huge bank they’ll definitely try to find a reason not to. The issuer would then write you a new check or pay by other means. It’s the issuing bank’s responsibility to deal with a legal battle with Wells if they don’t return funds, assuming there’s not a legitimate denial reason.
Now for OP. Their employee received the checks from their clients, employee stole the checks. Because the checks were meant to be delivered toOP for deposit.
I believe employee received the checks to give to employer to deposit. But instead employee deposited the checks into her personal account.
