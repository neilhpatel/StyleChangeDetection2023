Everything written in the Quran is relevant today, teaches you everything in your day to day life such as business, how to treat your family, your neighbors, what to do during war, etc... You may not agree with the teachings or rulings in the Quran but that doesn't mean its not relevant today.
Deeply sad. In the article it says one of the players got beaten by her mother many times for wanting to participate in athletics. Notably, her mother also tried to stop her from fleeing the country, and the player attempted to commit suicide. I hope one day the player will be able to play soccer again.
Of course the alternative to any religion is to believe the super complex universe, including the mountains, oceans, trees, sun and moon down to living things and the complex biological systems inside each human and animal is all random and came out of no where simply due to evolution.
one choice at a time. some will not make it. itâ€™s sad. but it starts with one. then the followers can try. not all of them will make it either. but if the land has no women, it has no nurturing, and no births. it will take years but it will make a difference.
Islam has no issues with science, it doesn't disapprove evolution (aside from the whole species evolving into a different species aka apes into humans which still has not been proven and is a theory) or big bang it just says their is a creator behind those things not randomness.
