The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy also has an excellent entry on . It is excellent overall but especially section 3.2 on objectivity and historiography and the following sections (including the earlier bit about Anglo-American philosophy, which is basically the analytic philosophy of history and historiography) might be what you are looking for.
But maybe I can tentatively address your last question. First off, if we're getting philosophical, Truth with a capital T pretty much goes out of the window and it's basically all, history and science alike, more about belief. Nevertheless, not all beliefs are equal. In history there is a clear difference between insights by professional historians who spend their lives studying their subjects in an honest fashion, in a community of colleagues and as unbiased as possible on the one hand and common sense notions of history on the other. Although historical methodologies are not that straight-forward and open to debate (as they should be), there definitely are methods of deriving historical knowledge.
These methods are not the same as the methods applied in physics or other sciences, but nevertheless historians do use certain ideas and methods to derive historical knowledge that go deeper than the opinion of the guy on the street. Much of this comes through critical study of sources, the fact that historians work in an international community of other historians, archeologists, philosophers and scientists, but also through the critical appraisal of the own biases and preconceptions one has as a historian. A holocaust denier for instance puts his political motives before his historical considerations. And although nobody can be completely unbiased, a true historian should at least be aware of this problem and do his or her very best of not letting his political ideas interfere with the history.
