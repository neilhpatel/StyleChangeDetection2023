So hearing aid technology, by virtue of being nowhere near as good a "replacement" for natural hearing as cochlear implant technology, and by the parallel paths of the Deaf community and technological development, was never a threat to the Deaf community.
Even with the mid-century development of transistors allowing for even better and smaller hearing aids, the Deaf community was on the rise. With the first academic paper on American Sign Language being published in 1960,^ and the return of sign language to the classroom in the form of in the 1970s, nobody felt threatened by hearing aids - community cohesion could even be said to be at an all-time high with the Deaf President Now movement in 1988, which had a . Many students in this time wore hearing aids - but they were predominantly to assist with environmental sounds and some communication. They didn't replace natural hearing at all - as cochlear implants are said to do.
To divulge from the historical aspect a bit: cochlear implants would be far less controversial if they all came with sign language DVDs. The threat isn't the technology - it's the removal of sign language, the treatment of implanted kids as if they were hearing, etc. The Deaf community has a lot to offer the world (see Deaf Gain: Raising the Stakes for Human Diversity by Bauman and Murray) - the threat is only in its eradication, not by specific technological means.
