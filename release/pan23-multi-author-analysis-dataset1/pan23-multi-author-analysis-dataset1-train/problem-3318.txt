She didn't. The bill that got passed is a verbatim version of the deal worked out using neutral arbitration between the unions and the rail owners. It never included sick leave and was favored by a significant amount of the workers in the unions. The sick leave was an extra provision that was originally lobbied for by the unions before it was dropped in order to get a deal done. Now Pelosi could have added it to the deal and passed it as one bill but it's likely it would have failed in the Senate.

Tetra Bio-Pharma has cannabis clinical trials currently underway against morphine, oxycodone and Hydromorphone. Will be a huge boost to them. They also have a separate partnership with Dr. Lance LIOTTA at George Mason University for cannabis based ARDS-003 which has shown promise against sepsis and immunomodulatory effects and halting the cytokine storm of covid. Bargain basement prices for the stock now but not for long methinks. They will be receiving a DIN from Health Canada in near future for Dronabinol and just won an international award in Malta for best cannabis medical device. Plus have patnerships everywhere including with DanCanna Pharma who just won the EU GMP designation . They have a ton of intellectual property, multiple patents and five Orphan Drug Designations.
