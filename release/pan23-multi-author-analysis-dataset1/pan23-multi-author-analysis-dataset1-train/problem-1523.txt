It's unlikely. The damages are not directly the result of the suit, nor is it clear that he has done anything legally wrong. Missing three days in the first three months of employment is not an unreasonable basis to fire someone, especially when one of those is.... questionable at best (mediate a roommate fight??).
The mediation situation was specifically due to the particular PTSD responses of one of the roommates that is a direct result of the past threats and acts of violence (both physical and sexual) from said ex-roommate, which have made her incredibly conflict-avoidant to the point of having a tendency to blindly run away thinking she is in danger despite no signs of danger in a present conflict. And as I said, the employer has been completely understanding due to the circumstances at the apartment. She had been told of the complex situation in the apartment beforehand as well. But this isn't specifically about her, as we both know the response is fully reasonable and are willing to at least understand that much. Our issue lies in the ex-roommate and his actions in this case. There is a lot more nuance to the situation and a laundry list of things that contribute to the emotional distress and the concept of frivolousness in the lawsuit, but it would take me a fortnight to explain all of it here.
