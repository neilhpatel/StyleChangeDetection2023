Well, sure, but that adds to any intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action. I have a records request in for the supposed policy, and can almost guarantee it does not say they require ID for chip redemption at my threshold. But we'll see.
As to your claim that “all the cashiers know me and know my play” I find that hard to believe as casino cashiers are usually just singularly focused on counting out the right amount of money so they don’t get fired for a $100 variance, and following the rules their boss sets like “ get ID from anyone who might possibly be trying to cash out over $10,000 in aggregate on any night or who is otherwise acting weird.”.
Thanks for the response! I think you're right, but I'm too damn stubborn to give it up just yet. I've filled a complaint with the OCCC as a first step.
Given that you hadn't lost your wallet, the fact that you were standing at the Cage window asking questions like this in the new casino could also be viewed as suspicious the next time you make a transaction there, as the ordinary player is not obsessed with finding loopholes regarding how to make cash transactions without showing ID.
Thanks for the response! I will review in detail and respond with any follow up question that may arise. The compact you cited is for Tribal Casinos. This was not at a tribal casino.
