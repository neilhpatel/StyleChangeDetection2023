Yes. Because Republicans could have tanked the bill Biden signed. They didn't. If they thought they could put the blame on Biden don't you think they would?
Absolutely correct. I'm glad at least some portion of Reddit is acknowledging this. I hate the GOP and Republicans as much as I hate Democrats. I hate the divide and black/white political lines. We can disagree on many things but can always find some common ground. But if a republican president had signed this it would be plastered ALL OVER social media. No surprise it took me a number of minutes to find anything on Reddit about it. But any story mentioning the GOP's part in this was upvoted and awarded to the moon. Shame on people for their selective outrage. These workers deserve to be treated like normal humans and deserve their sick leave.
