There was an ideological struggle between Right-wing congressmen that form a plurality in Congress vs the (nominally) left-wing President. It's just that the ideological struggle quickly gave pass to serious acussations of corruption on Castillo's family and advisors. Believe me that at the beggining everyone that wasn't full anti-Castillo had doubts on the accusations, but that was more than a year ago. What started as a discovery of 20,000 bucks on his secretary's toilet and suspicous ascensions in the Army; now are accusations of his nephews demanding money from the intelligence service, corruption networks inside the Ministry of Transport & Communications by one of the ministers he fiercely defended, or what appears to be another network to assign construction projects in his home province of Chota to the best briber.
Wish I knew what to believe about this ongoing situation. I feel as tho I want to believe people in Peru, but then if I had an average American explains American topics to a foreigner, I doubt they’d really encapsulate what’s going on, especially if they’re right leaning even in the slightest ….
The actual jail time can be up to 30 years. The crimes he is being accused are quite serious in peruvian law.
