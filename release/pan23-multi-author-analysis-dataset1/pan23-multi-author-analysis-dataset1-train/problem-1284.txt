and before anyone say the usual "but the mongols were so ancient", nope, not, mongols started around 13th century and kept raiding and genociding even after they were fragmented, til they were finally beaten by other powers in the 19th century. Colombus , the villified colonizer of Americas, discovered America in the 15th century. so if Colombus is a "valid" target, then so should be the mongols. in fact, i'd argue mongols were way way more destructive and posed a real threat to civilization extinction.
the mongol genocides were much greater than the modern popular imagination. i'd say glorifying mongol military "feats" with no regards to their destruction to civilization is quite genocide-apologist in itself.
