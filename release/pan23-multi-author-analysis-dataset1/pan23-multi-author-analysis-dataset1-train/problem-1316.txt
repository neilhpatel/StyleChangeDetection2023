Seriously. I’m 33 weeks pregnant with our first baby. People (friends and family) are already trying to make plans to visit her as soon as she’s born. I have a hard time with boundaries, but I’ve made it very important for myself and my husband to remind people we need to protect ourselves and our newborn with how bad this winter is shaping up to be. I mentioned everyone needs to wait at least 2 months, be vaccinated, and mask up until she’s a little older. Some are understanding and are willing to wait and take precautions. Some…are not and have been very rude about our rules.

That's pretty significant actually. A lot of left leaning people don't necessarily approve of Biden as president, but think it's miles better than Trump.
… Bandwagon? It’s no secret many voted for Biden to get Trump out and he was seen as the better of the options given. With 2 years under his belt now those that didn’t believe or doubted him are acknowledging how impressive and dedicated he has been.
