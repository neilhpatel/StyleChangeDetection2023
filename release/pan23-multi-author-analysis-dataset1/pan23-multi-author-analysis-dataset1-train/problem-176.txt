Better change your bank accounts and lock his credit profile. I work for a bank and I’ve seen this scam before. Next they will use the deposit info to drain your bank account and then the credit info to open credit cards in order to fund another package scheme with another person and keep the money train going. These people are based in Asia usually and outside of the legal reach of the US, so all you can really do is prevent yourself from losing the rest of your money - because they will come for it now that they have his info.
It could be the case. Most of the stuff were factory sealed watches and iPads and clothes making up etc. my husband opened some of the packages. No drugs.
I’ve had success in the past finding an attorney for a free or low-cost ($30 for 30 mins where i live) consultation by contacting my state bar association - this works in almost every US state, and the ones where it doesn’t still have links to get you started from what I’ve seen.
Exactly right. That's the scam; the "company" uses stolen credit card info to buy online expensive things that can be easily re-sold for cash. Items are directly shipped to OP. OP then resends to the scammers who cash in.
