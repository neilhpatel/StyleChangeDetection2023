When the Spanish colonised the Americas, they split their colonies into vast subdivisions, like New Spain (almost all of their North American possessions) and New Granada (the northern third of South America). These were not independent states, nor were they ruled directly from Madrid, but were rather governed by a viceroy, or a governor empowered to act in the name of the king. What we would think of as their "capital cities" would typically be the location of the Audiencias Reales, or royal courts, from which Spain could project its power and authority via these viceroys. Spain had no way to predict that their empire would collapse, and that their vast viceroyalties would split into various smaller states, so the construction of cities like Tegucigalpa or Managua was completely unrelated to the need for a "capital city".

Interesting. Is it fair to speculate that if trade by sea was more common (was it uncommon?) that larger port cities would've developed and likely become capitals?
