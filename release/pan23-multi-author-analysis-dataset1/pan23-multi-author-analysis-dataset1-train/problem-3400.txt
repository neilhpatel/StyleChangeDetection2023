Bananas are an excellent example of why genetic monoculture farming is problematic over the long term. First the gros michel banana dominated, but a blight hit it and wiped out the world's gros michels. Then the cavendish banana took its place, but a blight hit it and wiped out the Old World's cavendish bananas, and now that blight has crossed the Atlantic.
obesity is absolutely related. yes the UK has a fast food culture and people eat tons of stuff like pies and pasties and fried foods, junk foods, etc. (the US isn't so different in that regard) but in the US it's all about additives and extra processed stuff. in the UK and most other first world developed nations as well, of course. But some countries are better than others about what's allowed for sure. my argument wasn't about whether GMOs are scary (jury's out on that still) but they certainly aren't necessary. also, the USA produces so much garbage corn it's used in everything... high fructose corn syrup being a super contributor to american obesity and unhealthiness.
Commercial banana plants are propagated asexually. Which makes their successive collapses a good illustration of genetic monoculture weakness.
i get it. i'm not so much in fear of GM crops as the quality of produce in Europe just seems so much better, even the cheap stuff. I'm the US but live in the UK. Also, eastern europe is pretty great and yes, nice and cheap.
I'm not ideologically opposed to genetic splicing. Yet with the current implementation and legal framework, patentable GMOs are basically setting up major staple crops for a similar collapse.
Yeah? Got a citation where any farmer had to pay out because another father's seeds blew into their fields?
