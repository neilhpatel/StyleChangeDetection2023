Fukushima was a huge disaster but it was also pretty avoidable: the plant design was American and equipped to handle waves up to x meters, beyond that? Absolutely nothing.
被曝 vs 被爆 is a major difference. I’m currently finding only articles about 被曝, as in radiation exposure, with little to no articles using the word to describe victims themselves.

"nuclear bad" ignorance like this piece of shit have kept us polluting with coal and oil for half a century.
