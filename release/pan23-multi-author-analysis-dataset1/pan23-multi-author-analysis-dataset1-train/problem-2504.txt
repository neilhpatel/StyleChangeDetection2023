They aren't going to be able to tell you if the child is suspended or not. (Granted, you can probably figure it out if your kid tells you if the other student is there or not, but saying how another child being disciplined is a FERPA issue.) You can say that you don't think it is being taken seriously enough. You can say that you think it was bullying and there is probably district paperwork you can fill out that will require an investigation. You can also ask for a safety plan if you are concerned about a repeat of this behavior. Ask for it in writing.
(1) To acknowledge that certain behaviors or conditions occurring within a family or school environment indicate that a child is experiencing serious difficulties and is in need of services and corrective action in order to protect such child from the irreversibility of certain choices and to protect the integrity of such child's family;.
I disagree with part of your comment. Schools in the US do not all have insurance that covers injury. They have insurance that covers some cost of being sued if they were negligent, but playground injuries (intentional or not) go on regular health insurance. That may be true in your area, but is definitely not true in my state.
