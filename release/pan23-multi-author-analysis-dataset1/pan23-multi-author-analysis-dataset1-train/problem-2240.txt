However, if the will says you have a right to the proceeds in the case that the house is sold, then you don't currently have what are called "vested rights" in the house. This provision is called a contingent interest, in that your "right" to the house is contingent on the sale happening. Until the house is sold, you have no legal rights here. You can still ask your sister to sell (out of the kindness of her heart), but you have no legal recourse if she declines to do so. I hope I explained that in a way that makes sense.
I mean, I don't know if the sister is an asshole, I'm just saying that ensuring half of the recipients of a willed property never get access to the value they were willed because she has physical control of the property and can live there for free, thus saving herself a ton of money at the expense of her brothers receiving their inheritance is kind of an asshole move. Hopefully OP can get her to see the fairest outcome for everyone is to get bought out, but he shouldn't give up a "life-changing" amount of money to keep his sister living for free in this house either if she's inclined to be an asshole.
1. A vested right is not typically transferable by will or intestacy. Should OP die before the house is sold, the proceeds will simply be distributed between the remaining parties.
