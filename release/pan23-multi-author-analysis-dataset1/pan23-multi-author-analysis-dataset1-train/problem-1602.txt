Your description states that you can't afford to throw everything away and start over but I guess you're going to have to make a choice between what you can afford and the amount of risk you're willing to have that you will bring these bedbugs with you. If it were me, I'd get rid of everything and pick up a bunch of hand-me-downs from the salvation army. In the bad old days, I used to move frequently to do internships, and I'd just get a bunch of stuff at goodwill and throw it out at the end of the summer. It's not that expensive.
So... in my opinion, that all really sucks & bed bugs are the worst, but I don’t see that your landlord acted illegally and that you have a cause to sue (also, if he had an exterminator treat 8 times, that’s why code enforcement told you he isn’t violating laws - he isn’t) . If you can prove (outside of hearsay) that your neighbor thru gross negligence has caused these infestations, maybe you can claim against them. But I’d talk to your renters insurance & see what they’d do.
