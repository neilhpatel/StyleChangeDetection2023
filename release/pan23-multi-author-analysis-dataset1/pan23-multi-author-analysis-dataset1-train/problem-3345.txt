An NDA usually includes a promise not to file a lawsuit. If she doesn't have an attorney, doesn't want an attorney, doesn't want to sue, then she's not giving up anything by taking their money and signing the NDA. But she needs to understand it, no one should sign anything they don't fully understand and agree with. Their NDA might contain language where she agrees to not report anything to the police. Almost without exception, or perhaps entirely without exception, you cannot sign away your rights to report a crime, even if the document says you agree to not report a crime. A judge might even void the whole thing. That doesn't mean someone should sign something they don't intend to honor. It's good that she's been contacting an organization, hopefully something like rainn.org that helps people in his situation. She can get a free consultation with an attorney to see what her options are, or she can go this alone, and many police departments are open 24/7 (more commonly in cities and more populated areas).
