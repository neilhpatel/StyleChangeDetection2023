To add some context, Jahangir's father Akbar is the one who started the practice of inviting representatives of all different religions to debate at court (every Thursday evening!). Jahangir largely followed suit as part of his broader efforts to emulate his renowned father as far as possible. Akbar seemed to have a very personal and passionate interest in comparative religionâ€”he was equal opportunity in pointing out the theological inconsistencies in Christianity, Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and...Islam. In fact, his critiques of Islam came first: spotting its inconsistencies drove him to explore other religions in the first place, to see if they all suffered from this lack of logical cohesion. (Spoiler alert: they did.).
It also seems difficult to argue that the Jesuits had a drastically different knowledge- base or set of assumptions than other Europeans in the early Indian Ocean World, and those people definitely struggled with the courtly cultures they encountered.
That article is a joy to read. That said, there's a passage in which a Muslim describes Christian theology as being split into three schools, one which holds Jesus as God, one which holds him as the Son of God, and one which holds him as the Prophet of God. My memory of Catholic theology is that the first two are held to be true simultaneously. Was this an accurate picture of Christianity at the time, or any time before?
Interesting! It would make sense that it also happen in the Mongol court because the Mongols are the "parent" of the Mughal empire. The Mughal founder, Babur, is a descendant of Timur (Tamerlane), who inserted himself into the lineage of Chinggis (Gheghis Khan) via marriage and conquest when building his empire in the late 1300s. This means the Mughal's courtly culture would take a lot from their Mongol past, though filtered through about three centuries of history.
