Today, in what is likely to be its final hearing, the January 6 Committee voted to refer criminal charges for Donald Trump and several of his allies to the Department of Justice. The committee will release its final report on its investigation into the attack at the Capitol later this week. The committee also voted to refer several members of Congress who ignored its subpoenas to the House Ethics Committee.
Good. Glad they’re finishing up before the new house takes over. We’ll get to laugh at 2 years of the GOP smearing shit on the walls and then we’ll get to vote them out again.
"All this was inspired by the principle – which is quite true within itself – that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.
I just tried on mobile. Nothing on the front page. Clicked into the politics section, nothing until I scrolled down and saw this tiny text:Jan. 6 Committee criminal referrals of Trump are political 'theater,' DOJ likely to ignore say legal experts.
