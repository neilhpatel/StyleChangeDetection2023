In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Agree. The country falls to fascism in 24. The future is nothing but mass shootings while we praise white bullet providing Jesus and ban talking about minorities unless we're talking about ways to marginalize them. All hail great provider DeSantis.
Meanwhile the "Christian nationalists" you're supporting are seeking to gut Medicare and Social Security, weaponize congressional committees to pursue political vendettas unmoored from reality and play a game of chicken with the debt ceiling that could crash the economy if left unresolved.
I know everything you said. Same team, buddy. Check the Senate map for 2024 and tell me what D pickups and R pickups are likely. Ds are defending eight vulnerable seats and Rs none. Twenty-three Dems and Independents are up for re-election in ‘24 to eleven Republicans. It’s simply a bad election in terms of what seats are vulnerable.
