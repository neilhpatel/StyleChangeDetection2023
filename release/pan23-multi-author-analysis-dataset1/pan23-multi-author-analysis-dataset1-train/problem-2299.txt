The corporations avoid low-profit-margin free markets if at all possible and buy laws to make sure markets aren't free. HALF of all corporate profits are now through intellectual monopoly laws raising prices above the natural commoditised free market price. It's a much larger problem than most people realise. You've likely been propagandised all your life to believe you're help the poor starving individual artists and inventors by obeying copyright and patent law. But it's just not true, and by supporting the historically very recent (us didn't even join berne convention until 1989) hyper intellectual monopolist global regime beloved of the mega corporations, you are helping prop those corporations up.
What? Last I checked the estimate was around 23 trillion dollars or so are lost to tax-havens, tax-evasion etc. of which the largest- and richest actors stand for over 80% of it.
Yup.....good example. I was wondering myself if Suckerberg will come up with another name since he lost a bunch of money last week and had over 11,000 job cuts to boot.
