Are there good records about the ratio that fled/migrated away from this new "milder" form of oppression/control? Was it popular amongst the black communities - especially the growing evangelical communities like the Southern Baptists - to take a perspective of supporting the laws (and decrying/ostracizing the "criminals") or just tolerating/enduring the laws? Or even working to change/fight the laws?
Almost immediately. These laws started to be passed in 1866, during the first phase of Reconstruction under Johnson which was generally considered quite weak, seeing Southern governments immediately passing a number of laws, such as the above, and other restrictive black codes. The Reconstruction Acts were then passed in the next two years, beginning the Military Reconstruction / Radical Reconstruction phase. This did see the doing away of many of the black codes, but not all of them, and these laws mostly survived intact to one degree or another, as they were harder to attack, often being written race blind and it being more a matter of selective enforcement in many cases. And of course then with the end of Reconstruction and the triumph of the Redeemers, they were able to double down.
