So were there signs? Sure. But it’s more likely that the signs have come to stand in for the more insidious forms of discrimination in housing, and in Britain writ large: long waiting lists for council housing, which put all immigrants on waiting lists based on residency; or council housing that was poorly suited for the needs of applicants; or private landlords and ladies who turned away Irish applicants because “the neighbors might object,” often based on stereotypes about what Irish migrants “were like” and “how they lived,” e.g., often in crowded lodging houses, which had nothing to do with “Irish culture” but most everything to do with the fact that they couldn’t afford or rent anywhere else for the time being.
Thanks for your amazing answer. This part stuck out to me "As hostility towards black migrants increased, the Irish became deracialized and assimilated into the category of “white”".
You're most welcome! I don't know of any research on the exact wording other than what can be gleaned from primary source accounts, eg, the race relations sociologists.
